# Floridians already feeling economic effect of DeSantis immigration law
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U)
*  The state's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill in May, just weeks before [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=0.0s)]
*  he announced his run for president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=5.84s)]
*  The law bans local governments from issuing ID cards to people who cannot prove citizenship. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=7.9s)]
*  It requires hospitals that accept Medicaid funds to ask about a patient's citizenship [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=13.08s)]
*  status. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=17.72s)]
*  It also increases penalties for people who hire or transport undocumented immigrants. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=18.72s)]
*  And it expands the use of e-Verify, a federal database employers can use to check a worker's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=24.18s)]
*  immigration status. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=29.86s)]
*  Florida's strict new immigration law, courtesy of Ron DeSantis, just may backfire, driving [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=33.66s)]
*  away the very people the state relies upon for its agricultural backbone. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports that just days after the law went into effect, agricultural [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=43.34s)]
*  and construction businesses are already experiencing a labor shortage. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=47.9s)]
*  And the law could also pose a threat to Florida's other main industry, tourism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=52.42s)]
*  The State Department of Motor Vehicles said some driver's licenses issued by other states [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=56.66s)]
*  will no longer be recognized as valid, releasing a list of four New England states which issue [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  some licenses that do not meet the new law's criteria. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=66.12s)]
*  How long the law remains in effect is uncertain as the Department of Justice fights it in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=70.66s)]
*  court. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=74.5s)]
*  But as the summer season wears on, the practical effects of the law may take hold sooner than [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=75.5s)]
*  later. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  Florida State Representative Anna Escamani is a Democrat serving the people of Orlando. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=81.97999999999999s)]
*  She was elected to the Florida House in 2018 after she flipped a formerly Republican district. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=86.2s)]
*  She herself is a daughter of immigrants and she joins me now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=91.86000000000001s)]
*  Representative, it's always so good to see you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=95.34s)]
*  You represent a district in central Florida, including parts of Orlando and its suburbs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=97.7s)]
*  Tell me how your constituents are reacting to this new law and how it's impacting them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=102.9s)]
*  directly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Katie. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  It's great to see you here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  My constituents are incredibly frustrated by this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Not only do we just have a diverse community in central Florida that embraces our immigrant [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=115.58s)]
*  neighbors, but as you mentioned in your introduction, we're seeing ramifications in multiple industries [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=120.22s)]
*  from agriculture to tourism to construction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=127.02s)]
*  We're facing a housing affordability crisis and we need labor. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=132.06s)]
*  We need the support of diverse people to help lift up our communities and to ensure that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=136.22s)]
*  we have strong workforce to sustain our growth. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=141.18s)]
*  This policy is pushing out so many hardworking Floridians. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  And of course, under Governor DeSantis, we're not seeing any real solutions being proposed [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=150.22s)]
*  to actually solve any of the challenges we face with immigration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  So it's been really, really frustrating. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=159.82s)]
*  And of course, the economic effect is being felt already. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=162.06s)]
*  A lot of this is being framed as Governor DeSantis doing things, getting things done, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=166.14s)]
*  but he can't do any of this without his state legislature. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  So what kind of justifications and excuses have you been hearing from your Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=174.7s)]
*  colleagues in Tallahassee who are driving these hard right turns right alongside Ron DeSantis? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=179.26s)]
*  Well, as most folks probably assume, there is no backbone in the Republican Party of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  Florida right now, despite even having farmers in the legislature who now admit that this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  policy was 100% politically motivated. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  The GOP got right in line to support DeSantis, pushing forward these extreme policies that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=200.78s)]
*  are out of touch with the everyday American, let alone the average Floridian. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=206.78s)]
*  And again, I think we can all share commonality that we want to see solutions when it comes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=211.66s)]
*  to immigration, but this isn't it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=216.78s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal's notoriously conservative editorial board actually went so far as to call [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  this immigration bill a, quote, misfire, writing the law will, quote, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=225.82s)]
*  dent the state's economic expansion, which has produced a jobs and tax revenue boom. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=230.3s)]
*  It makes no sense for DeSantis to punish his own state, even as he vows to clean up the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  mess in Washington. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  But Representative DeSantis has made it clear he wants to make America, Florida. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=241.9s)]
*  You know, it just came out right now that Florida is now America's inflation hot spot with Miami, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach having the highest inflation rate of metro areas with more [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  than two and a half million residents with a 9% inflation rate for the 12 months that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=258.14s)]
*  ended in April. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  That's more than double the national average of 4%. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=263.26s)]
*  I mean, if you're an American not living in Florida, this doesn't bode well for you if [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=265.9s)]
*  DeSantis is courting you for his vote, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=270.06s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Floridians cannot afford Florida right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  While DeSantis pursues his culture wars and attack immigrants, we cannot afford our rent. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=277.5s)]
*  Property insurance is out of control. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=282.38s)]
*  We see increases in our food pantries and demand for food pantries at a neighborhood level. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=284.38s)]
*  Things are really bad here in our state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=291.74s)]
*  And of course, DeSantis is nowhere to be seen because he's too busy trying to curry favor with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=294.14s)]
*  Iowa caucus voters while he continues to ignore the real challenges we face in the Sunshine [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=298.54s)]
*  State. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Representative, before I have to let you go, this new statistic came in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=305.18s)]
*  Workers at several construction sites in South Florida saying a quarter to half of their teams [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=308.62s)]
*  are gone. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=313.58s)]
*  I mean, DeSantis is destroying agriculture and construction industries in the state of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=314.94s)]
*  Florida, but Florida homeowners are facing grotesque insurance rates, insurance bills. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  They can't even get insurance to insure their homes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=325.02s)]
*  And Floridians are facing existential threats because of climate change. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  But are these issues just too woke for Ron DeSantis? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=331.58s)]
*  That's the sad part of it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=336.78s)]
*  We've seen Governor DeSantis and other Republicans just continue to distract and deflect through [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=338.46s)]
*  culture words. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=343.42s)]
*  And I will say this is an opportunity for Democrats, including the Biden administration, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=344.06s)]
*  to be true problem solvers and provide solutions, whether it's a climate crisis, the cost of living, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=347.98s)]
*  or in the context of this conversation, real solutions to immigration. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=354.38s)]
*  This is a time for Democrats to lead. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=357.42s)]
*  Florida State Representative Anna Eskamani, as always, I'm grateful for your insight. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=360.54s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=364.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPo70ObCL4U&t=373.42s)]
