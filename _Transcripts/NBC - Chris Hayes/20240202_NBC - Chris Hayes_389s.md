Video Description: Former Army Ranger and Democratic Rep. Jason Crow says we must readjust the proportion of the tools in our toolbox: humanitarian, diplomatic, economic, and military. "We have not brought the right proportion of those tools to bear and that's why we continue to have to use military force over and over again."

# U.S. 'has over-relied on military force,' says ex-Army Ranger Rep. Crow
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM)
*  Congressman Jason Crowe is a Democrat of Colorado who sits in the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And he joins me now. And, Congressman, your thoughts on the strikes that have been announced tonight? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=7.36s)]
*  Yeah, good evening. I agree with Senator Duckworth that this appears to be a good response that shows [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  strength, shows capability, and retaliates for the killing of our soldiers, but also avoids [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  de-escalation. So that's the near-term analysis, but the long-term analysis also, as Senator Duckworth [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=28.0s)]
*  aptly pointed out, must be. How does this serve our longer-term interests? What is the end game here? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=35.04s)]
*  You know, most of my adult life we've been fighting and have had conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=41.68s)]
*  So we very clearly need a different model. We've been walking around carrying a hammer for the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=46.96s)]
*  last couple of decades. Every problem looks like a nail. So what does a different model look like [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=51.84s)]
*  that can actually de-escalate and change the entire scenario long term for the Middle East? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=57.04s)]
*  And that's the discussion that's really important for Congress to be engaged in. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=63.04s)]
*  Let me ask you what that is. I mean, I was struck tonight. You said for most of your life, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=67.2s)]
*  I think we're around the same age, Congressman. And I remember the Gulf War was when I was 11 in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  1990. I'm 44 now, so 33 years that some sort of U.S. military activity directed at Iraq has been [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=76.72s)]
*  happening three quarters of my life. When you say changing that model, what do you mean by that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=83.84s)]
*  Well, you know, we for a very long time have over-reli-ed, this is my opinion, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=92.72s)]
*  we have over-reli-ed on military force. And the problem with that, and don't get me wrong, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  there is absolutely a time and place to use military force. And I completely agree with the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=102.4s)]
*  president in these retaliation strikes that are meant to reestablish deterrence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=108.32s)]
*  But we continue to do this over and over again. So let's look at how do we readjust the proportion [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  of the various tools in our toolbox, humanitarian, diplomatic, economic, and military. How do we [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  find a better proportion and how do we leverage all of those tools to better achieve an end that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=129.2s)]
*  we frankly have not been able to achieve. So my argument is, my thesis here is we have not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=135.84s)]
*  brought the right proportion of those tools to bear, and that's why we continue [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=141.04s)]
*  to have to use military force over and over again here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=144.72s)]
*  Let me follow up and ask about diplomatic channels with Iran. Obviously, there's a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=148.16s)]
*  number of interesting diplomatic channels that have developed recently. There's a Qatari channel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=152.4s)]
*  through which US negotiators, including the director of CIA William Burns, has been involved [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=158.32s)]
*  in negotiations with the Israelis and Hamas representatives through the Qataris for some [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  kind of exchange of cessation of hostilities for mass release of hostages in Gaza. There is no [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=172.16s)]
*  real Iran channel of diplomacy active right now. There was one that tried to revive that nuclear [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=182.56s)]
*  deal the Trump administration ripped up. There's some channel through the Qataris, but do you think [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=190.72s)]
*  that's something that's needed lacking? Well, I'm almost always a proponent of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=195.68s)]
*  establishing some method of communication to avoid misunderstanding, because when you have [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  very large and capable militaries that have significant capabilities that are operating in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  close proximity to one another, a very easy way for this to go awry is for actions to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  misunderstood. And that's why making sure that the retaliatory strikes that the administration took [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=219.04s)]
*  today were carefully calibrated, were strategic, and were surgical, because a misunderstanding is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=225.04s)]
*  exactly how this turns into a larger Middle East conflict with very large militaries fighting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  each other directly. And when you have not a few soldiers being killed, which is a terrible tragedy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=237.04s)]
*  in and of itself, but you have very large numbers of soldiers meeting themselves on the battlefield, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=243.76s)]
*  which is what we want to avoid at all costs here if we can. Let me ask you this, a slightly political [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  question or a question about your constituents in your district. How top of mind is this for the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=255.44s)]
*  folks that you represent in the third district in Colorado? Well, it's very top of mind. I have the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=260.96s)]
*  honor of representing one of the most diverse congressional districts in the nation. And 20% [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  of my constituents were born outside of the United States. I have 130 languages spoken in my community. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  I have a large Jewish community. I have a large Arab community. I have a Palestinian diaspora. So [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  I've been engaging with these folks weekly over the last couple of months. I engage with them all [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=286.64s)]
*  the time the last couple of years, but I've been doing extra the last few months to make sure that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=292.96s)]
*  I'm listening to them, I'm hearing their concerns, and we figure out how we can address this, because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  it's their lived experience that informs my work. They have families and loved ones who are in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=303.36s)]
*  harm's way, whether it be in Israel or in Gaza. I held a roundtable a couple of months ago with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=309.12s)]
*  Palestinian members in my community, and one gentleman told me that he lost 50 members of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=316.24s)]
*  his family in the last couple of months. Fifty members. That's one family. It's truly heartbreaking. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=321.12s)]
*  So that informs my work to make sure that we are putting humanity first. We're putting the protection [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  of civilians first. I'm a former Army Ranger. I served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=331.92s)]
*  What I learned in that time is that the protection of civilians in conflict zones is a mission [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=337.04s)]
*  essential priority. It's not secondary. It's not a distraction. You can achieve no mission, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=343.84s)]
*  and you can make nobody safer unless civilians are protected, and that is a priority. I've done a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  lot of work for the last couple of years to further that goal. Congressman Jason Kroll of the sixth [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=355.84s)]
*  district, not the third, I misspoke. Third is Bobert, sixth district of Colorado. Thank you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=361.84s)]
*  very much, Congressman. Appreciate it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=366.88s)]
*  you [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-A5-Jv0bBM&t=373.84s)]
