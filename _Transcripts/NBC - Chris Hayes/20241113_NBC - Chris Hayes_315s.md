# ‘Tough to watch’: Why the Biden-Trump White House meeting was ‘pretty enraging'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU)
*  Today Donald Trump returned to the White House for the first time since he slunk away four years ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=0.0s)]
*  skipping Joe Biden's inauguration. Biden invited the president-elect to meet in the Oval Office, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=4.48s)]
*  a tradition meant to symbolize the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=9.44s)]
*  next. And you can see him there. The two presidents sat side by side in front of a roaring fire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=14.16s)]
*  and put on a friendly face to the cameras. Well, Mr. President, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=19.52s)]
*  elect and former president, thank you very much. And Donald, congratulations. Thank you very much. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=23.919999999999998s)]
*  And looking forward to having a, like we said, a smooth transition. Do everything we can to make [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=28.72s)]
*  sure you're accommodated, what you need. We're going to get a chance to talk about some of that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=35.28s)]
*  today. Good. Welcome. Thank you very much. And thank you very much. And politics is tough, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=39.44s)]
*  and it's, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=46.96s)]
*  very much a transition that's so smooth. It'll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=53.2s)]
*  appreciate that, Joe. You're welcome. Are you still watching? Have you thrown the remote or switched? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=59.6s)]
*  I don't exactly blame you. I absolutely get why Joe Biden is following the normal rituals here, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=66.48s)]
*  right? Welcoming his successor, shaking his hand. It is to send a signal about the stability of our [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  system. But that doesn't negate the fact that that, for a lot of folks, that that scene is a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=79.04s)]
*  pretty tough one to watch. And the reason is because four years ago, from that very office, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=84.72s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to overthrow the republic and fomented a violent coup, ending in people dying and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=89.68s)]
*  cops' heads being bashed in. This time around, he also threatened to do the exact same thing if he [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=94.64s)]
*  lost. In fact, he was basically threatening that up until like 5 p.m. on election day, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=100.56s)]
*  except this time he won. And so, okay, I guess democracy carries on peacefully as usual, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=106.4s)]
*  because that's what the Democrats do when they lose. And we're all just going to swallow and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  live with that asymmetry. It feels weird and also pretty enraging. I mean, are we supposed to take [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=117.44s)]
*  away that our democracy had a narrow escape because Donald Trump won? So instead of deranged and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=128.24s)]
*  dangerous lies and conspiracy theories and maybe more violence and who the hell knows what else, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=135.2s)]
*  right, if he came up a few hundred thousand votes short in the swing states? Instead of that, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=141.6s)]
*  we get a happy fireside chat. And on the next January 6, 2025, there will be no gallows erected [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=146.64s)]
*  on the Capitol grounds. And instead, Kamala Harris will preside over the peaceful constitutional [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=154.0s)]
*  certification of the electoral votes, as she should, to be clear, as she should. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=158.32s)]
*  But Donald Trump's electoral victory does not solve the central problem that he specifically, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=162.24s)]
*  and a lot of the folks in the movement he commands, remain a dangerous threat to the continuity of our [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=169.84s)]
*  constitutional republic. We're seeing it today. They still don't respect democratic norms or the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  law or facts. They don't believe the rules apply to them. At the same time, we shouldn't come to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  the conclusion that because he won, all of that doesn't matter. Yes, the majority of Americans [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=186.72s)]
*  decided that January 6 and all of Donald Trump's other crimes were not enough to sway their vote [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=193.28s)]
*  against him. I don't think that means they don't care about our democracy. And I know that I and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=198.96s)]
*  a lot of my fellow citizens still care deeply about our constitution, about our tradition of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=205.36s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power, about upholding this thing that is at its roots, and that is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=209.12s)]
*  that is at its root self-governance, like not being ruled by some other person but [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=215.44s)]
*  us ruling ourselves. So I'll be clear, I do not know what the solution is, as we're now [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=220.24s)]
*  preparing for another four years of Donald Trump in power. And I just refuse to accept that this, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=225.84s)]
*  this thing, like January 6th if Democrats win, fireside chat if Republicans win, is the way [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=232.64s)]
*  things just are going to work now. I don't accept the idea that there's one set of rules for him [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=240.24s)]
*  and another for everyone else. We can't accept a status quo in our elections where if one side wins, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=246.88s)]
*  they have to scratch and claw to withstand the lies and the legal challenges and the violent [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=252.72s)]
*  mobs. And if the other side is successful, then they're invited to measure the drapes and gather [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=256.0s)]
*  around the fireplace. I mean, yes, the nature of preserving democracy in institutions and norms is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=259.36s)]
*  that you uphold them even for people like Donald Trump who have tried to tear them down. I get that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=264.56s)]
*  But I'm just saying this thing, this is not a sustainable equilibrium. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=270.24s)]
*  One side upholds liberal democratic norms, the other subverts and tries to destroy them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=275.6s)]
*  It's going to break one way or the other. I don't know how it ends up or who wins, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=280.32s)]
*  but that central struggle didn't dissolve because the insurrectionist won more votes this time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCTykcSEdaU&t=286.88s)]
