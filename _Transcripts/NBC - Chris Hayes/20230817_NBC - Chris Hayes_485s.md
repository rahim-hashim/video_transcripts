# Hayes: Trump is ‘obviously’ fomenting violence against judges, prosecutors
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, Fulton County District Attorney Fonny [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=0.0s)]
*  Willis, who is prosecuting Donald Trump and 18 other criminal under racketeering charges, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=4.32s)]
*  announced her office is investigating threats against grand jurors who indicted the ex-president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=10.56s)]
*  NBC News reporters Blaine Alexander and Ryan Reilly first reported yesterday that Trump [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=17.44s)]
*  supporters leaked the reported addresses of grand jurors online, along with their names, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=22.16s)]
*  which did appear in the indictment. And this is just the latest example of threatening behavior [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=26.8s)]
*  by Trump supporters directed at the various people working to hold him accountable for the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=32.0s)]
*  crimes he is accused of. We also learned yesterday that a Texas woman was arrested and charged with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=36.16s)]
*  making threats towards Judge Tanya Chutkin, who is overseeing Donald Trump's federal January 6 trial. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=42.72s)]
*  According to the criminal complaint, Abigail Jo Schreie left a threatening voicemail intended [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=49.36s)]
*  for Chutkin, where she refers to the judge with a racial slur and apparently said, quote, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=55.04s)]
*  If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly before using [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=59.92s)]
*  another slur. She also targeted a Texas Democratic congresswoman and vocal Trump critic saying, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=65.92s)]
*  quote, We want to kill Sheila Jackson Lee. Now, when police questioned try, they showed up at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=72.8s)]
*  her door to talk to her. She, quote, stated she had no plans to travel to Washington, D.C., or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=78.08s)]
*  Houston to carry out anything she stated, adding that if Sheila Jackson Lee comes to Shry's hometown, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=82.8s)]
*  then we need to worry. Get that? This woman, visited by the FBI, threatened Congresswoman [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=89.12s)]
*  Sheila Jackson Lee again to them, to law enforcement. Couldn't help herself. And we learned [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=95.28s)]
*  about all that in just the past two days, two days. Now, if you go back last week, there is, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=101.84s)]
*  of course, the case of the armed Utah man who was killed by federal agents after he made very [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=106.32s)]
*  specific threats of violence against President Biden, as well as district attorney Alvin Bragg, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=110.56s)]
*  who he threatened to shoot. Bragg, of course, is the one prosecuting Trump in the Manhattan [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=115.52s)]
*  hush money case. I could spend the entire hour listing threats made by Trump supporters against [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  the ex-president's perceived enemies. Fonny Willis says she has been on the receiving end of racist [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=126.0s)]
*  threats as well. And we can all see what's happening here. I mean, threats happen in public life and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=130.72s)]
*  they're not contained to one part of the ideological spectrum. I want to be clear about [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=136.88s)]
*  that. But what's happening here is part of a larger story, part of a long history of menace [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=140.48s)]
*  and violence as a form of political power wielded by Donald Trump and the Maga right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=146.48s)]
*  These are not just isolated incidents. This is coming from the top down. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=152.32s)]
*  Donald Trump knows exactly what he's doing when he goes on social media and he shares a picture of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=156.0s)]
*  Judge Chuck Chutkin with a post calling her an activist judge, accusing her of running election [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=161.12s)]
*  interference. Just today, Trump's campaign released this video attacking special counsel [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=166.16s)]
*  Jack Smith for subpoenaing access to his Twitter account. How dare a lowlife prosecutor derange [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Jack Smith? That's right, he's deranged. Break into my former Twitter account without informing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=179.44s)]
*  me and indeed trying to completely hide this atrocity from me. It's very obvious what Donald [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=185.12s)]
*  Trump is doing, right? What he's trying to cultivate, a sense of menace and the possibility [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=191.52s)]
*  of reprisal, retribution, violence from the most diehard supporters. When he calls the prosecutors [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=197.44s)]
*  charging him to range, when he accuses him of committing an atrocity. I mean, at the very least, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=203.52s)]
*  and this is me bending over backwards to be charitable, let's say that Trump certainly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  appears to be unbothered when his supporters make good on the implicit requests in his inflammatory [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=212.4s)]
*  language. And I want to be really absolutely clear here because I think a lot of this stuff [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=218.88s)]
*  gets memory hold right in the flow of the news. We're not talking about hypotheticals or thought [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=223.6s)]
*  experiments or abstractions. A few months ago, a deranged QAnon supporter bashed in the head of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=228.88s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's elderly husband with a hammer after breaking into her house and describing how [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=235.68s)]
*  he was there looking for the speaker who he wanted to torture in her own home. That man, after that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=241.44s)]
*  break in, was then excused and defended outright, lied about by nearly everyone in the political [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=248.4s)]
*  right from Elon Musk to Donald Trump himself. In the run up to the 2018 midterms, another thing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=255.36s)]
*  that's been memory hold. Do you remember there was a guy with a Trump themed van who mailed actual [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  pipe bombs. They didn't go off, but they were real pipe bombs to prominent Trump critics in government [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=266.72s)]
*  and the media. There was also the as yet uncaught pipe bomber. Another thing that's been memory [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=271.52s)]
*  hold. Remember that? The early hours of January 6, who wanted to try to, again, with actual bombs, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=277.84s)]
*  blow up the DNC and the RNC the night before January 6. Of course, there was January 6 itself [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=284.88s)]
*  when Trump supporters made good on the promise of violent political force storming the Capitol in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  an attempt to overthrow the US government. Some insurrectionists even constructed a gallows. Some [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=295.84s)]
*  chanted they want to hang Mike Pence. Reportedly, Trump used that might not be such a bad idea. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Because this is who Donald Trump has always been. His obvious personal cowardice aside, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=308.08s)]
*  he's a guy who thinks political violence is acceptable means to an end. A desirable one, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=314.08s)]
*  in some cases. Don't forget, he spent his entire first presidential campaign encouraging attendees [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=320.64s)]
*  at his rallies to assault protesters. I get a little notice in case you see the security guys, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  we have wonderful security guys. They said, Mr. Trump, there may be somebody with tomatoes in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  the audience. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=337.36s)]
*  them, would you? Seriously. Okay, just knock the hell out. I promise you, I will pay for the legal [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=343.6s)]
*  fees. I promise. So when Trump posts to social media the picture of Judge Chuck, and when he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=350.64s)]
*  posts videos like the one we played for you a moment ago, let's call it what it is. He is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=356.56s)]
*  obviously fomenting violence against the judges and prosecutors. I mean, if something terrible [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=362.24s)]
*  happens, what are we going to conclude? Every warning sign is blinking bright red. And of course, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=368.24s)]
*  yes, most Trump supporters, the vast majority are not violent. They're not going to do something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=377.04s)]
*  violent. And even among those who make threats, you know, the Shry woman, for example, I don't know, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=380.48s)]
*  most probably are not serious. Again, the vast majority. But this is kind of a numbers game here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=387.44s)]
*  It's a big country. So some small percentage of them are. We know that to be true. Again, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=394.8s)]
*  this is not an abstraction. The longer Trump keeps inciting and agitating, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=401.44s)]
*  it's a roll of the dice each time. And the greater the odds, iteratively, are that that small group [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=407.2s)]
*  of people who could do something will do something. It only has to be a few. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=413.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is utilizing that reality to increase the cost of prosecuting, to increase the cost of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=421.2s)]
*  crossing him in the same way a mafia boss would. He has been explicit. He posted himself, quote, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=428.24s)]
*  If you go after me, I'm coming after you. I am not a lawyer. I do not claim to know what counts as [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=434.72s)]
*  actionable speech in a legal sense. Furthermore, the First Amendment in the United States is broad [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=442.64s)]
*  for a reason. And as a journalist, I like it that way. Put that aside morally, though, morally. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=448.32s)]
*  We all know what's happening. And we all know who's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  culpable for what's already happened and what may be to come. Mark my words. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q5mSaFqoA&t=458.88s)]
