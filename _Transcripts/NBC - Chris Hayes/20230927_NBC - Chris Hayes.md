Video Description: “What we are seeing is a parallel to the 1930s in Nazi Germany," says Retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey on the Trump movement. “That’s 15-25 House members, a couple of Senators, and all those who are Trump MAGA loyalists—it’s a major threat to the armed forces of the United States."

# Former top U.S. general Trump movement is ‘major threat to armed forces'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g)
*  General Barry McCaffrey is a retired four-star U.S. Army general. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a recipient of three Purple Hearts. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Paul Rykhoff is a former U.S. Army infantry officer, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=5.84s)]
*  host of the Independent Americans podcast, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=8.44s)]
*  and they both join me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=10.6s)]
*  General, let me just start with you and your reaction [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=12.72s)]
*  to just what we've seen in the last really, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=16.16s)]
*  I mean, four or five days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=19.12s)]
*  You've got the Tuberville blockade, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=20.28s)]
*  you've got the vote against the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=21.76s)]
*  because he wants to mix. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=24.2s)]
*  He talks about race and he wants to mix it in the military. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=25.68s)]
*  You've got two people, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=28.6s)]
*  Donald Trump, Paul Gosar, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=30.6s)]
*  calling for the execution of Milley. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=31.92s)]
*  You've got votes today, successful in the House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=34.36s)]
*  This isn't just one person saying it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=36.72s)]
*  Two votes today, one vote that would successfully [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=38.2s)]
*  take the salary of Austin down to a dollar. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=41.8s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=44.6s)]
*  Well, first of all, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=47.16s)]
*  I strongly endorse your opening comments. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=48.0s)]
*  I think that was very sound, very objective. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=50.32s)]
*  This is worth being extremely concerned about. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=52.36s)]
*  During the follow-on to Trump's lost election, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=56.4s)]
*  he actually made moves, which I said at the time, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=60.24s)]
*  to run a coup against the governor of the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=64.32s)]
*  There's no question in my mind, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=66.4s)]
*  he put a retired lieutenant colonel in and set death, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=67.84s)]
*  sent a gang of people over there with him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Mark Milley and the senior officers of the armed forces [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=74.08s)]
*  did swear an oath to the Constitution, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=78.28s)]
*  and they wouldn't go along with it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=81.36s)]
*  So I think what we are seeing is a parallel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=82.8s)]
*  to the 1930s in Nazi Germany. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=86.72s)]
*  I don't say that's a Republican party. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=90.16s)]
*  That's 15 to 25 House members, a couple of senators, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=92.64s)]
*  and all those who are Trump mega loyalists. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=97.2s)]
*  This is a cult, it's a lawless cult, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=100.64s)]
*  and it's a major threat to the armed forces [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  of the United States and our security. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=105.88s)]
*  It's shameful to talk about General Mark Milley. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  By the way, he's not gonna be intimidated. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  He's a Prince and Hops player, he's a tough guy, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=114.0s)]
*  he has years in combat. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=116.4s)]
*  His mom and dad fought in World War II. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=118.44s)]
*  But it's a shameful act on the part of those [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=122.4s)]
*  who are speaking in a manner [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=125.52s)]
*  to support authoritarian government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=127.76s)]
*  This is outrageous. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=130.24s)]
*  You know, one thing that's so striking [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=133.04s)]
*  when you see Milley is, you know, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=134.48s)]
*  I think if I sat down with the top brass of the US military [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=136.2s)]
*  and we just talked politics, there'd be a lot, I think, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=139.08s)]
*  that we don't see eye to eye on, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=142.28s)]
*  people have different views, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=143.12s)]
*  I'm coming from a different place. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=143.96s)]
*  But I think one of the things that Milley expresses, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  and I think the thing you really see is, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=148.12s)]
*  Milley reiterating that there is a bedrock, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=150.68s)]
*  ironclad consensus, loyalty, and fidelity [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=153.56s)]
*  to the US Constitution, and ultimately, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=156.68s)]
*  that is incommensurable with loyalty to Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=159.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's drawing a line. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=163.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=164.16s)]
*  And saying, I stand on this side, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=165.0s)]
*  and you stand on that side. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=166.16s)]
*  And Milley retires on October 1st, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  and I hope he lets the fist fly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=169.48s)]
*  We need to hear from everything he knows, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=171.72s)]
*  and I think it's his patriotic duty, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=173.64s)]
*  I think it's critical to our national security, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=175.72s)]
*  because what this is all about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=177.48s)]
*  is about what I've called the American insurgency. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=179.12s)]
*  It is a political and social movement [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=181.4s)]
*  focused on violently overthrowing our government. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  And it has lead elements, including Trump, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=185.28s)]
*  including folks like the former national security advisor, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=187.24s)]
*  Mike Flynn, and the lead soldier in this, in Congress, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=191.0s)]
*  is Tommy Tuberville, who is ridiculous, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  radical, reckless, and racist. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=195.76s)]
*  And I've called him Senator Redneck, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=198.0s)]
*  because that's what he is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=199.88s)]
*  You want someone to lead this ridiculous, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=200.76s)]
*  racist thing that undermines our national security? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=202.52s)]
*  Tuberville's like me, I'll be your guy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=205.32s)]
*  And he is now doing that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=207.16s)]
*  He's got 10 minions who've followed him [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=208.24s)]
*  to vote against C.Q. Brown, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=209.84s)]
*  and every day it's something new [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=211.12s)]
*  that undermines our national security. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=212.92s)]
*  It hurts our troops, it hurts our morale, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=214.72s)]
*  our enemies are celebrating, Vladimir Putin loves this, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=216.36s)]
*  but there's also the political side of this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=219.16s)]
*  This is driving the GOP further and further away [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=220.8s)]
*  from America, and especially from independents like me. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=223.32s)]
*  I've called this the Confederate wing of the GOP. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=225.56s)]
*  They don't want to preserve the military of 2023. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=227.64s)]
*  They want to create the Confederate army. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=229.64s)]
*  They want to take us back to the 1800s. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=232.2s)]
*  They don't understand this modern world, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=234.16s)]
*  and they're fighting it, and we've got to fight back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to follow on that, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  and I'll come back to you in a second, General, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=240.04s)]
*  just the idea that, you know, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=241.72s)]
*  you and I are around the same age, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  And obviously you served during that part of that period, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=246.44s)]
*  that intensely fraught period, right, post 9-11. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=249.72s)]
*  The idea that the military is woke, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=253.04s)]
*  like the idea that like, and what they mean by woke is, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  faithful to a creedal vision of the nation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=259.36s)]
*  as bound together across difference [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  in support of the Constitution, that to them is woke. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=264.32s)]
*  But what they also mean is diverse. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=266.88s)]
*  And what they also mean is not like them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=268.68s)]
*  I'm glad you're naming it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=270.56s)]
*  because there are serious racial components [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=272.04s)]
*  to every element of this, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=274.0s)]
*  They continue to oppose some of the historically [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=275.44s)]
*  important heroic leaders of our military [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=278.04s)]
*  who are also black. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  Time and time again, Tommy Tuberville [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=281.64s)]
*  is opposite significant black leaders, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=283.24s)]
*  and he says, I'll be the guy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=285.88s)]
*  I'll be the one to take that politically [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=287.36s)]
*  unpopular position because he wants to be this savior. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  He wants to be this person who will go up to Trump [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=291.72s)]
*  and say, I'm your guy, because it's a coordinated attack [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=295.04s)]
*  to undermine our national security [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=297.68s)]
*  and push their political agenda [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=299.04s)]
*  and anyone that stands in their way, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=300.6s)]
*  even if it's the Pentagon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sZcWL928g&t=302.12s)]
