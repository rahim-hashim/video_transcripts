# Legal woes pile up for Trump as he faces possibility of more charges
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ)
*  In just six months, we'll have the first election days of the 2024 presidential race. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  First, the Iowa caucuses, then New Hampshire, soon thereafter. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=4.68s)]
*  And on the resume of the current favorite in that race is a staggering list of legal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  entanglements that the voters might want to consider. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=12.68s)]
*  This morning, we learned that the ex-president received a target letter from special counsel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=15.88s)]
*  Jack Smith in his sprawling investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=20.06s)]
*  election. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=25.12s)]
*  This is separate from Jack Smith's other criminal investigation into Trump's handling [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=26.12s)]
*  of classified documents. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=30.84s)]
*  In that case, he's been indicted on 37 felony counts, including willful retention of documents, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=32.68s)]
*  conspiracy to obstruct justice, and false statements, among others. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=39.84s)]
*  Then there is the Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis's criminal investigation into [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=44.84s)]
*  Trump's efforts to overturn the election in Georgia. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=49.96s)]
*  Last night, Georgia's top court unanimously rejected Trump's last-ditch effort to shut [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=53.52s)]
*  down that investigation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  The DA has set a timetable for announcing potential indictments for the coming weeks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=61.2s)]
*  In New York, the ex-president is facing a trial early next year in his 34-count felony [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=65.76s)]
*  indictment by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over a hush money payment scheme [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=71.38s)]
*  that involved falsifying business records during the 2016 election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And all of that is just Donald Trump's potential criminal exposure. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=81.54s)]
*  On the civil litigation front, he's facing multiple lawsuits, including one brought by [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=86.26s)]
*  the New York State Attorney General that accuses Trump and his business of staggering fraud. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=90.54s)]
*  That case heads to trial in October. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=96.5s)]
*  Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, is also suing him for unpaid legal fees relating to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  Cohen's 2019 congressional testimony. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=103.42s)]
*  Jury selection has just started in that case. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  Back in May, the ex-president was found liable for defamation and sexual assault and ordered [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=108.98s)]
*  to pay the writer, E. Jean Carroll, $5 million. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  But his defamation trouble has not ended there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  In June, a federal judge allowed E. Jean Carroll to amend another defamation lawsuit against [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=120.78s)]
*  Trump to include disparaging comments that Trump made about her during a town hall. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=126.04s)]
*  Everything seems to be culminating all at once for this man who is also the front-runner [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=132.1s)]
*  in the Republican primary race for president of the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=136.34s)]
*  So when does any of it actually begin to matter for him politically? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=139.46s)]
*  That's what we're talking about right after this break. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWACgzInaQ&t=145.62s)]
