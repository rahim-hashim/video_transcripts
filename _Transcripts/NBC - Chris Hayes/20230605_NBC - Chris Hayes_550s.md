Video Description: “When I worked for him, he would regularly pick up the phone and call Republicans without much fanfare, without announcing it. He's kind of a bridge builder by nature. The open question is if that strategy will pay off in 2024,” says Jen Psaki. Kate Bedingfield and Robert Gibbs join Jen Psaki to discuss.

# Psaki: In 2024, Biden seeks to distinguish Republicans from MAGA extremists
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE)
*  And in my time working for the president as his White House press secretary, I saw firsthand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=0.0s)]
*  just how he thinks about his role and how he thinks about Republicans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=4.64s)]
*  And as he looks ahead to 2024, he's reaching back to the success of his 2020 bid and the messaging [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=8.16s)]
*  around that, campaigning against Trumpism without totally alienating all Republicans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=14.32s)]
*  The idea in part is for the president to convince people who may not be Democrats [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  to come over and support him too if they can't stomach Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=24.8s)]
*  And it's not just politics. That's also who he is. When I worked for him, he would regularly pick [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=28.4s)]
*  up the phone and call Republicans without much fanfare, without announcing it. He's kind of a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=34.08s)]
*  bridge builder by nature. The open question is if that strategy will pay off in 2024. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=38.88s)]
*  My next guests are people who I've spent a lot of time with in their offices, on the phone, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=45.04s)]
*  texting them about strategies. So I'm so grateful for them for being here tonight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=49.84s)]
*  Kate Bedingfield is the former White House communications director under President Biden. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=54.24s)]
*  We worked very closely together. Robert Gibbs served as the White House press secretary for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=57.92s)]
*  President Obama. Also worked very closely with him. I want to start just with this overarching [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=62.0s)]
*  question, Kate, for you, because you worked for the president for so long. You know him very well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=67.04s)]
*  I think his overarching view is that there's a real appetite out there in the country for someone [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=71.68s)]
*  who can find common ground, even with members of the modern day Republican Party. That promise was, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=75.44s)]
*  of course, a big pitch in 2020. How central, Kate, do you think that is going to be to the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=80.0s)]
*  reelection campaign and the messaging of that as we look to 2024? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=85.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Jen. This is a treat. But yes, I think that's going [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=91.36s)]
*  to be a critical piece of the messaging in 2024 because for two reasons. One, because as you said, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=95.2s)]
*  it is fundamentally what President Biden believes. It is how he has long navigated Washington, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=100.48s)]
*  frankly, successfully. And he fundamentally believes that leaders should be able to find [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=105.84s)]
*  common cause when they can. And I think secondly, it will be a huge piece of the messaging because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=110.24s)]
*  we should do away with this notion that it's an either or dichotomy, that you either have to fire [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=115.36s)]
*  up the base or you can reach out across the aisle. Remember, Democratic voters are people who also [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=120.8s)]
*  want to see progress. They want to see things get done. And so what President Biden's been able to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=126.64s)]
*  do in the first few years of his presidency is notch wins where Republicans wouldn't come along, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=131.12s)]
*  things that he couldn't get them to do. He went and did them himself. The Inflation Reduction [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=136.8s)]
*  Act, the biggest investment in tackling climate change in a generation. He did that without [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=141.52s)]
*  Republican votes, but he was able to get Republican votes for a gun safety bill, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  able to get meaningful things done with Republicans. And for him, that's fundamental. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=149.84s)]
*  And I think that is what voters want to see. And you can bet that that will be a central piece of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=154.24s)]
*  his pitch for 2024. So, you know, obviously it's going to be a part of his pitch. Kate, Kate just [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=158.32s)]
*  confirmed that for us gives you've done a lot of campaigns. You didn't work on the Biden campaign, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=162.96s)]
*  but in this age of Trump, do you think that message in this environment is going to work [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=167.44s)]
*  if it's central to the president's reelection campaign? I think it won't only work. I think [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=173.12s)]
*  it's what the American people yearn for. And I don't think it's a glowy romanticized version of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=179.12s)]
*  it. They just know that in an argument where two people are having that argument, the likely answer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=184.72s)]
*  lies somewhere in the middle. And I totally agree with Kate. I think people come to Washington to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  get things done, whether you're the most junior member of Congress or the most senior member of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=197.2s)]
*  the Senate or the president of the United States. You want to see progress on things. And the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  American people are sophisticated enough to know that the only way they're going to see progress [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  is if both sides work together. And they spent four years watching somebody foment division, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=212.72s)]
*  sometimes and almost always unnecessarily. Biden pitched himself as the competent grownup in the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  room that would wipe away the chaos and could bring Washington together. I love the line he's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=226.88s)]
*  been using, and I'm sure he's been using it for a while, that he's, you know, I was told this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=231.68s)]
*  bipartisanship was dead. I think that is a great way to pitch it. I think his accomplishments show [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=236.24s)]
*  it. And I have no doubt we're going to hear a lot about it over the course of the next two years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=242.64s)]
*  So one of the big elephants in the room here, see what I did there, is all of these legal woes and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=246.88s)]
*  troubles for Trump. I mean, he's already been indicted. He could be indicted in a federal court [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=252.72s)]
*  soon. The president has not spoken about it. He is an observer of the tradition that you should [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=258.16s)]
*  not comment on an ongoing investigation. Do you think, Kate, that continues to be the strategy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=263.68s)]
*  moving forward as these cases become not about hush money to an adult film star, but about [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=269.68s)]
*  democracy and about national security and rule of law? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=275.68s)]
*  Well, I think President Biden has never hesitated to call Donald Trump out for the threat that he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  believes that he poses to democracy. So, you know, I would say that there's no question that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=287.84s)]
*  President Biden is going to always never going to shy away from calling out what he sees as a really, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=292.4s)]
*  frankly, an existential threat to our country. However, he's also going to continue to focus [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=297.44s)]
*  on what he's gotten done on the case that he has made for bringing back manufacturing jobs, for, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=302.48s)]
*  you know, bringing semiconductor chips back to this country, making sure we're having our supply [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=309.2s)]
*  chains here in the United States. We're not dependent on countries overseas. He's doing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=313.36s)]
*  things that are making a difference for the economy. He's doing things that are tackling, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=317.44s)]
*  as I said earlier, our climate crisis, the gun crisis. He's fighting to protect our rights. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=320.96s)]
*  He's fighting to protect the right of women to have access to abortion, to reproductive health. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think what you're going to see, I would imagine what you will see from the president, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=330.88s)]
*  is you will continue to see him make the case for the things he's done, the promises he's kept [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  frankly from the 2020 campaign. But you will also see him never shy away from calling out the threat [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=339.04s)]
*  that he believes that Trump and MAGAism pose to this country. I ask this because I think it's a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  really tricky balance, right? And most Democratic candidates, most candidates don't have to run [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=351.92s)]
*  against Trump. So Gibbs, what do you think about whether the president should weigh in more on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=356.24s)]
*  the broad messaging of these cases or these cases in general? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, I think the tacky is taken so far, I think, is the right one. Look, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump guarantees every day that the news about Donald Trump is going to get [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=371.84s)]
*  hefty placement in our news diet. There's not really anything that the president needs to do to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=376.56s)]
*  push that case forward. I think it's also going to be interesting to watch when or if the Republicans [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=382.0s)]
*  running against Trump begin to try to shout out a difference between him and an indictment, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=389.28s)]
*  whether it's in New York, or whether it could be coming indictments. I think the president is best [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  suited, as Kate described, to make the case that really works so well in 2022, which is, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  are you in the mainstream or are you in the extreme? And I think what Donald Trump, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=408.64s)]
*  what Republicans are, whether it's on guns, whether it's on abortion, whether it's on [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=413.36s)]
*  health care costs, I think they're a party that seems to be a step outside of the mainstream, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=420.8s)]
*  particularly when it comes to swing voters. That's the contrast I think he draws the most [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=426.48s)]
*  blood from. I think it's the one he's best suited given his political leanings for the course of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=432.16s)]
*  his career. I think those are the contrasts that you'll see him make the most. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=439.2s)]
*  So Kate, I'm a believer that the president is often underestimated. I know you are too [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=443.44s)]
*  from talking to you about it. There is one thing a lot of people are freaking out about [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=448.96s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, and that is enthusiasm among young people, among progressives. What is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=453.52s)]
*  your take or what would you tell them so that they don't freak out about where this is headed [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=460.4s)]
*  and how the president is going to work to win those votes? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=466.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, it feels like sometimes there's a cottage industry in professional [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=471.52s)]
*  democratic circles of one, both underestimating Joe Biden, but also ringing your hands and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  panicking and frantic. We spent as much energy tackling the problems as we did telling reporters [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=480.96s)]
*  we were worried. The narratives might be very different. But look, I think ultimately what the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=487.2s)]
*  president is going to do is going to continue to focus on the case he's made. And I think it's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=493.04s)]
*  important to remember elections don't happen in a vacuum. Elections are about choice and about [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=497.68s)]
*  contrast. And the president frequently says, you know, don't compare me to the almighty, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  compare me to the alternative. And so as the campaign goes on and you continue to see this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=507.12s)]
*  contrast between the extremism of Trump and the MAGA Republicans and this progress that Joe Biden's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=512.16s)]
*  offering, I think people will at the end of the day, they're going to pull that lever for Joe Biden. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  Kate Bedingfield and Robert Gibbs, two of the smartest people I know in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=522.24s)]
*  democratic politics and communications. Thank you so much for joining me tonight. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5o069L_OE&t=525.52s)]
