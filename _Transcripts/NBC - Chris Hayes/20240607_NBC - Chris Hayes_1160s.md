# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Steve Bannon is going to prison. It's been a long time coming today. The former adviser to Donald Trump who wears two button down shirts on top of each other for no discernible reason was ordered to report to prison for four months starting on July 1st for his conviction on federal contempt of Congress charges nearly two years ago. Bannon you might remember was subpoenaed by the January 6th select committee back in 2021 and like fellow Trump adviser Peter Navarro [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=0.0s)]
*  and several members of Congress including Jim Jordan and Scott Berry. He just flatly refused to comply. Didn't evoke his Fifth Amendment just said no. Go take a hike. Now Navarro was also convicted of contempt and is currently in a federal prison in Miami after appealing his case all the way up to the Supreme Court which refused to bail him out. Bannon too played out a lengthy appeals process which he ultimately lost. Though we should note this is hardly Mr. Bannon's first brush with the law. You remember [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=30.0s)]
*  might remember back in 2020 Steve Bannon was arrested on the yacht of a Chinese billionaire. And in fact if he were not bailed out by a last minute pardon from Donald Trump on the final day of Trump's presidency Bannon may already have been imprisoned following the federal indictment from Trump's own Department of Justice. An indictment which says he grifted millions of dollars from hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters through phony claims that he would privately fund construction of the border wall. They didn't really do it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=60.0s)]
*  Two of his co-defendants in that case pleaded guilty to those charges. A third was convicted of trial. They are currently serving between three and five years in federal prison as part of the same plot that Bannon was accused of being part of. Bannon however was spared that fate by his former boss after January 6th when Bannon proved himself to be a vital ally during the attempted coup including as the January 6th committee revealed frequent contact with Trump in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=90.0s)]
*  the hours before the insurrection. While certain close associates of President Trump privately expressed concerns about what would occur on January 6 other members of the president's inner circle spoke with great anticipation about the events to come. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=120.0s)]
*  The committee has learned from the White House phone logs that the president spoke to Steve Bannon his close adviser at least twice on January 5th. The first conversation they had lasted for 11 minutes from those same phone logs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=135.8s)]
*  We know that the president and Mr. Bannon spoke again on the phone that evening this time for six minutes. We also know that Bannon was an adviser to the group of Trump allies who met at their so-called command center at the Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  ahead of January 6 to plot ways to steal the 2020 election. In fact according to journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa Bannon was at the Willard when Trump called him on the night of January 5th. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=163.0s)]
*  And to be clear Bannon wasn't trying to hide his involvement in the scheme in the days and weeks before January 6th he dedicated hours of his daily podcast to the big lie of a stolen election often dropping less than subtle hints that something explosive was in the works. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=175.44s)]
*  People are getting revved up. People are getting fired up. People are getting madder as they should. Mike Pence's his moment of destiny awaits him and it's coming on the 6th of January. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=193.56s)]
*  It's to have clarity that January 6th was going to be the day or one of these big days and you had to converge everything down to January 6th. Starting tomorrow it's going to be wild. You're just like two days. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=206.28s)]
*  So it's incredible. You're going to be part of history. We want as many people to get here as possible. As first terms ending with action in the second term is going to start with a bang. All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=216.2s)]
*  Just understand this. All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Now almost two years after being convicted Steve Bannon is going to prison. But that's not all because Bannon is also facing a state criminal indictment here in New York. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Once again for that same scheme to rip off diehard Trump supporters and steal their money from them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  Just like everyone else in Trump world Bannon likes to whine about vengeance is coming for the people put him away. Good you'll. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  The real explanation is much simpler. Donald Trump's criminal convicted on 34 felony counts who surrounds himself with a bunch of other criminals like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro and his longtime political operative Roger Stone who Trump sprung from jail. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=257.4s)]
*  Head of the 2020 election and Paul Manafort Trump's former campaign manager sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on a fraud conviction who was also freed by his former boss and Rick Gates Trump's deputy campaign manager who got prison time on charges of conspiracy in line with the FBI and George Papadopoulos the former Trump campaign ad who did a brief stint in prison for lying to investigators about his contacts with Russia. He also got a Trump pardon. And of course Michael Cohen who got sentenced to three years in prison for the work he did for Donald Trump partly for his role in the stormy Daniels hush [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=271.64s)]
*  money scheme among other charges and Alan Weisselberg the former Trump organization CFO who is currently as I speak to you right now in a cell in Rikers Island awaiting a two dollar million dollar payment from Trump to keep his mouth shut. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=301.64s)]
*  So Steve Bannon joins a real rogues gallery of Trump associates going to prison. He could talk all he wants about revenge but his number one concern should be finding a guest host for his podcast for four months. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=316.36s)]
*  Joining me now is Glenn Karchner former federal prosecutor who is inside the courtroom with Steve Bannon today. The Kate Coppins staff writer for the Atlantic who's covered Steve Bannon extensively even once getting kicked out of his [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=331.96s)]
*  2020 rooftop election party which is a great sentence to utter. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=342.0s)]
*  He also has a piece author the new piece of the dangers of a second Trump term. Glenn let me let me start with you because you were in the court today. I guess it was an open question about whether the judge would actually say times up time to go to prison how to play out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=347.4s)]
*  You know Chris not only was it an open question I think most of us were on the edges of our seats because you really could not read where Judge Carl Nichols was going. John Crabb was the prosecutor former colleague of mine from the U.S. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=362.64s)]
*  Attorney's Office made a very compelling argument as to why. Now that the appellate court definitively shot down the one legal issue that Judge Nichols said was kind of an open question in his mind which is what prompted him to allow Steve Bannon to remain on release pending appeal. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=377.88s)]
*  David Schone got up and made what I thought were some valid points. And as he was questioning the prosecutor and the defense attorney you really could not read where Judge Nichols was going to land. And I think it wasn't until the very end of his announced findings that it became clear that he said now that the appellate court has basically definitively resolved the one question of law that Judge Nichols thought might be available to win. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=398.36s)]
*  Steve Bannon some relief on appeal. Then he just kind of brought the hammer down. He said you will report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons no later than July 1st to begin serving your sentence. And then something happened that rarely happens in federal court. I saw David Schone sort of sprint up to the lectern. And I can tell you from being in that courthouse for years usually you wait for an invitation from the judge before you approach the lectern. And he was loud and he was angry. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=428.36s)]
*  And the judge really had to put him in his place. But I don't know if that was performance for Bannon or perhaps somebody above Bannon. But it was pretty clear at that point that the judge had made up his mind and would not revisit his ruling. Yeah I mean they all as far as I can tell everyone in that world like to throw temper tantrums and throw their toys on the floor when they get upset about something that doesn't go their way. I mean the thing about Bannon McKay there's two aspects. One is you know [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=458.36s)]
*  part of it is he's got this you know professional wrestling heel stick. He does you know like I'm Steve Bannon and I'm so tough and scary and you should all be cowering. And it's like all right settle down there Magneto. We're going to we're going to be fine. But but there's also the fact that like in some ways there's a level which the cover up kind of worked like you know we never got the testimony from him. There was a reason he wanted to keep shut about it. Now he's going to go to four months in prison. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=488.36s)]
*  Yeah Steve Bannon is such a weird character in my life because I feel like like many political reporters he's just been this person that I've had to deal with for like a decade at this point. Right. He was you know a subject of mine. He's been a source of mine. He ran one of the most kind of poisonous right wing media outlets in America for a while. Then he helped get Trump elected. He's in the White House. And throughout all of this you know I [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=518.36s)]
*  will say just as an aside to your point I often kind of struggled with how to depict him because he clearly was one of these people who enjoyed so much being depicted as like a super villain character that I sometimes [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=548.36s)]
*  wondered if I was like doing his bidding by by contributing to that that characterization. But but what I will say is that like Steve Bannon eventually you know like throughout all of this this time just acted with [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=561.92s)]
*  complete impunity. And I remember when he was pardoned on the last day of Trump's presidency feeling like and talking to other reporters about this and just feeling like this guy is never going to be held accountable like that. He has escaped accountability. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=575.48s)]
*  But what's been interesting in the last several years is watching all these people in Trump's orbit you know one by one actually face accountability including Donald Trump himself. It's kind of culminated with his conviction. And so it is kind of a surreal [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=588.5200000000001s)]
*  moment for I think journalists like me and just people who have been following Trump and his allies for so long seeing them finally kind of get their come up and it's kind of almost it's hard to fathom. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=602.88s)]
*  Yeah. And you know in this case Glenn you know the sentence is the duration of a semester abroad. So it's not an insanely long sentence. But he is not out of the woods. I mean the New York case against him as we said before. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=617.68s)]
*  The other folks who are part of this scheme in federal court two pleaded one convicted doing three to five years that he's staring down like very very serious criminal liability this fall and maybe commuting to that trial from some federal federal [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=630.36s)]
*  penitentiary. Yeah. Kristen as you said in your lead in you know but for a presidential pardon previously for largely the same charges although in federal court he's now going to be tried in state court in New York. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=644.24s)]
*  He could already be in prison. And can I just build on something the case said which is that you know it feels like we are forever thirsting for accountability and it so rarely comes. But if we now look at the fact that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Navarro is serving a prison term Steve Bannon has been ordered to report to prison on July 1st and Donald Trump will be sentenced for 34 felony convictions on July 11th. You know there I say [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=669.28s)]
*  accountability might be trending at this point. We did not get a decision in the Donald Trump immunity case today. It has now been six weeks since the Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  prosecution for his attempt to steal a 2020 election. This means the court is delaying it and they know that that inevitably helps Trump. What makes us all the more preposterous is that two justices should have [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=693.84s)]
*  recused themselves from the immunity case already. One Samuel Lito who had two different coup flags flying outside his two homes and Clarence Thomas whose wife testified to the January 6th committee about her efforts in support of the coup. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=705.76s)]
*  And that is just the first level at which this court is so deeply compromised. New data out today from fix the court takes a look at the value of gifts to justices over the past 20 years both disclosed and then [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=720.12s)]
*  undisclosed gifts that were subsequently reported out to take you through just a handful of them give you a sense. Justice Elena Kagan's calculated you have received gifts valued at just under twelve hundred dollars. That's over 20 years. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg over fifty nine thousand dollars again over 20 years. Three thousand dollars a year. Now Justice Samuel Lito taking quite a bit more one hundred and seventy thousand dollars over 20 years. But none of that is in the zip code of the ballpark of Justice Clarence Thomas whose gifts took him to the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=731.36s)]
*  charts totaled over four million dollars to give you a sense of how that looks in chart form. Take a look. Can you see your justice Thomas is on that bar chart. The big red bar on the left. That's Clarence Thomas compared to all the other justices who serve during this [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=761.36s)]
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at the New York University School of Law, co-host of Strict [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=780.4s)]
*  Scrutiny, podcast along with Leigh Lippman and my wife Kate Shaw, and she joins me now. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=786.72s)]
*  I gotta say, at some level we knew bits and pieces of this. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=791.36s)]
*  There's been an amazing series of pro-public articles, some of which won the Pulitzer about [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=795.76s)]
*  all of the gifts that Thomas has gotten. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=799.68s)]
*  But to see it put out like that, like, am I wrong? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=802.04s)]
*  It's a generational scandal for the court. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=805.64s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=807.96s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=808.96s)]
*  We have seen this sort of trickle out piecemeal, but having it splayed out in the aggregate [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=810.24s)]
*  really does make clear the expanse of the grift. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=814.76s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the right term for it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  It is a grift. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=822.6800000000001s)]
*  If you think about Justice Thomas' salary over the course of his time on the court during [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=823.9s)]
*  this period that's been reported, it's roughly equal to the amount of the gifts that fix [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=828.84s)]
*  the court as identified here. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=834.8s)]
*  I mean, that is actually quite staggering. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=836.08s)]
*  He's managed to amass two distinct income streams. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=838.36s)]
*  Yeah, we actually ran the math on this. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=842.28s)]
*  The cumulative gross pay over that period is about $4.6, $4.7 million. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=844.52s)]
*  The total gifts is over $4 million. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=849.36s)]
*  He's got two masters. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=853.48s)]
*  Like, he's the servant of two masters. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=854.48s)]
*  He's working for the American people, and then he's got... [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=856.36s)]
*  Well, which American people? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=862.2s)]
*  Let's talk about that because... [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=864.28s)]
*  Well, he's been getting paid by the taxpayers. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=865.28s)]
*  For sure. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=867.24s)]
*  But, I mean, it has been said that look where your treasure is for there your heart will [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=868.24s)]
*  be also. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=872.92s)]
*  And it's not surprising that some of the individuals who have been linked to some of these gifts, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=873.92s)]
*  like the Koch Brothers Network, which has had Justice Thomas speak at donor events, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=878.32s)]
*  for example, happens to be deeply involved in a set of major challenges to the regulatory [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=881.84s)]
*  state. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=887.84s)]
*  These are cases we're still waiting for the court to decide, but we already know at least [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=888.84s)]
*  where the Koch Brothers would like Justice Thomas to be. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=893.16s)]
*  I guess now we're just waiting to find out if have they made enough payments on it? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=895.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=899.92s)]
*  But that's kind of where all of this is going. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=900.92s)]
*  Part of the argument that people will make in defense of Thomas is that, well, he was [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=904.28s)]
*  always a conservative anyway, and these are just his friends hooking him up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=908.76s)]
*  No, and it's not unconstitutional to have friends. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=912.88s)]
*  So I want to be very clear about that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=915.36s)]
*  You have a right to have friends, even rich friends. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=918.12s)]
*  But I think where the optics of this become more problematic is that we are seeing individuals [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=920.68s)]
*  essentially donate funds to the court to keep this conservative supermajority in play. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=928.48s)]
*  And so there's been a lot of reporting, some of it by The New York Times last year, about [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=934.36s)]
*  this Justice Thomas complaining about his small judicial salary, which is actually quite [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  significant relative to what other Americans make and how maybe he wouldn't stay on the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=944.24s)]
*  court. And all of these very wealthy interests were like, no, no, no, let's figure out how [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=948.4s)]
*  to keep you on the court and keep you happy. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=953.4s)]
*  And suddenly you see the money start rolling in. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=955.68s)]
*  This is a really key point. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=958.92s)]
*  I want to also talk about just the delay on the immunity case here, because it's not surprising. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=960.64s)]
*  I think they tipped their hand when they took so long. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=967.56s)]
*  First, they wouldn't let Jack Smith jump to the Supreme Court, even though we all knew [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=969.48s)]
*  they were going to want to weigh in, even though they did it on COVID cases, they did [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=974.04s)]
*  it on student debt. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=977.2s)]
*  Then they took it and they just sat on it for a while before they even announced arguments. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=978.2s)]
*  Then they announced arguments on the very last day. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  Now it's been six weeks. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=984.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=986.24s)]
*  No, I mean, we knew this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=987.24s)]
*  I've said this a million times. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=988.24s)]
*  By the time the Supreme Court weighs in on this, and I think this court must say at some [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=989.48s)]
*  point that there is no absolute immunity for a president from any criminal liability, but [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  there may be some details about what's private, what's public, what's in the outer scope, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=997.72s)]
*  the hour perimeter of the president's office. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  But whatever they do. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1003.08s)]
*  A wholly invented doctrine, just to be clear. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1004.36s)]
*  But whatever they decide, it is surely academic at this point because they have already in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1006.92s)]
*  effect immunized this defendant, Donald Trump, from liability for these criminal charges. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1013.08s)]
*  And that's kind of all that matters right now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1019.88s)]
*  I want to also play you this clip from Alito's neighbor who was in the sort of verbal altercation [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1022.52s)]
*  with him and his wife who gave an interview. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1028.14s)]
*  And she's making this point about, you know, when the flag went up, Alito says that it [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1032.8s)]
*  was about this verbal altercation. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1038.08s)]
*  Then he went to a Fox News reporter who just reported exactly what he said and didn't, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1039.76s)]
*  as far as I can tell, do any additional reporting. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  Here's his neighbor talking about the verbal back and forth they have. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1046.76s)]
*  I just want to emphasize that the interaction that happened on February 15th is the one [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1051.68s)]
*  that they're using as an excuse for why they flew the flag. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1057.24s)]
*  I really want to hammer home the fact that that happened on February 15th and their flag [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1061.52s)]
*  went up two or three weeks before that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1067.16s)]
*  That dates confirmed by text messages and a police call. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  Again, this may just be misremembered, but we still don't know why they were flying the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1073.76s)]
*  flag upside down on Joe Biden's inauguration day, right? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1079.52s)]
*  We don't. My colleague at NYU, Ryan Goodman, has actually made a really good point about [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  this. Justice Alito last week issued this letter to Senators Durbin and Whitehouse explaining [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1088.04s)]
*  that he was not going to recuse himself from these January 6 related cases, whether because [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1092.48s)]
*  of this flag, he has no obligation to recuse himself. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1096.96s)]
*  If Ms. Baden is correct, that the timeline is wrong and it seems like the timeline is [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1099.56s)]
*  wrong, like there's a real discrepancy between her timeline and Justice Alito's. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  He's essentially lied to Congress. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1108.48s)]
*  And I mean, Ryan Goodman, my colleague, has suggested maybe that is something worth [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1111.08s)]
*  investigating as a criminal matter. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1116.3600000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot going on here. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1118.0s)]
*  We haven't had these cases. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1119.48s)]
*  Are they waiting because of the proximity of the scandal to those cases? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1120.68s)]
*  Who knows? If that's the case, then we've already answered our question as to why Justice [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1124.2s)]
*  Alito should recuse because we're already asking those questions. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1129.08s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding. It's too it's too complicated. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1131.56s)]
*  It's not impartial. Melissa Murray, who is fond of flags as far as I know, flagrantly [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1133.72s)]
*  flagrantly fond of flags. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dog-7SorDgM&t=1138.68s)]
