# An oral history of how exactly Trump killed Roe v. Wade
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today one of the nation's most punishing and restrictive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=0.0s)]
*  Abortion bans went into effect in the third largest state in the Union in the state of Florida [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=4.8s)]
*  It is now a felony to quote perform or actively participate in an abortion after six weeks gestation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=10.44s)]
*  That is just two weeks after a missed period [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=17.6s)]
*  It's before many many women even know that they are pregnant the band does at least statutorily [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=20.48s)]
*  Provide exceptions for rape incest human trafficking up to 15 weeks of pregnancy and to save a woman's life or to prevent quote [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=26.96s)]
*  substantial and irreversible physical impairment [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=34.6s)]
*  But what we have learned from those exceptions in other states and what providers in Florida say is that they don't work that there will [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Be very serious consequences [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=43.88s)]
*  Florida doctor telling NBC News quote it's going to cause delays in care that are going to cost women significant health hazards or risks [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=46.72s)]
*  So as of today 17 states ban all or most abortions including the entire south that block there from Texas to Florida [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=54.62s)]
*  Three more states ban the procedure after 12 or 15 weeks one of those three, Arizona [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=63.46s)]
*  Recently upheld a Civil War era law banning nearly all abortions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=69.58s)]
*  Today just two Republicans in the entire state Senate joined all Democrats in the state Senate to repeal the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=74.66s)]
*  1864 law it's still expected to go into effect for a limited period of time over the summer before reverting back to that 15 week ban [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  In all in this country in 2024 as we head towards this election one in three women of reproductive age [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=91.18s)]
*  Lives in a state with an abortion ban [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=98.5s)]
*  That's a reality in America and the man responsible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=101.26s)]
*  Who has a 50-50 chance of getting back in the White House next year believes he did the country a great service [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  It was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=112.06s)]
*  always the plan from the great legal experts of this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=113.9s)]
*  Country and even the world they wanted to get abortion out of the federal government to everybody wanted that that was uniform [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=118.78s)]
*  So what's happened is now the states decide and they're going to votes in different states, and it's been an amazing process [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  but basically the states decide on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=131.86s)]
*  abortion and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=135.02s)]
*  People are absolutely [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=136.82s)]
*  Thrilled with the way that's going on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=139.38s)]
*  You can keep saying that but it's not gonna make it true [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=142.1s)]
*  The majority of this country is not thrilled with what Donald Trump did to reproductive rights not thrilled with women having to bleed out in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=145.94s)]
*  Parking lots before they can get into hospitals being medevaced out of hospitals in states like Idaho. They're not thrilled with that and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=155.94s)]
*  He has been not been getting anywhere near the level of blame that he deserves [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=162.9s)]
*  Today in Florida Vice President Kamala Harris pointedly gave Trump full credit for the abortion bans [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  At the stroke of midnight [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=174.94s)]
*  Another Trump abortion ban went into effect here in Florida [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=178.1s)]
*  as of this morning [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=184.14s)]
*  Four million women in this state [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=186.82s)]
*  Woke up with fewer [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=190.9s)]
*  reproductive freedoms than they had last night [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=193.42s)]
*  This is the new reality [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=197.06s)]
*  under a Trump abortion ban [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=199.26s)]
*  In a statement President Biden was even clearer saying in part quote. There is one person responsible for this nightmare Donald Trump and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  in politics [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=209.38s)]
*  People exaggerate all the time but on this it's just true. There is no question about it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is the man responsible for the abortion bans. He's responsible for the bans in Florida and in Arizona and 18 other states [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=216.42s)]
*  He's responsible for every woman that has to suffer awaiting care. They desperately need who's turned away [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=223.56s)]
*  in all the states restricting the rights and threatening the lives of millions of Americans [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=230.0s)]
*  Eliminating the federal right to an abortion was Donald Trump's plan from the very beginning [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=236.12s)]
*  He ran for president the first time on appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=240.24s)]
*  in your [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=247.28s)]
*  Election as president what criteria would you use to pick some of them pro-life? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=248.68s)]
*  There'll be pro-life and we'll see what about overturning but they will be we will appoint [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=255.28s)]
*  I will appoint judges that will be pro-life. Do you want to see the court overturn? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=260.16s)]
*  Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that's really what's going to be had that's will happen [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=264.36s)]
*  And that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  justices on the court [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, there was lots of stuff that Donald Trump was real hazy about real foggy about there was a lot of misdirection [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=277.44s)]
*  Even now this year there wasn't on this issue. It was clear as day. He said it over and over [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=284.16s)]
*  In fact, he even released a list of the anti-abortion anti-road judges [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=291.04s)]
*  He would choose from the people on that list were chosen by conservative groups including the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=295.6s)]
*  Now Donald Trump clearly had literally no idea who they were [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=302.08s)]
*  Just that they fulfilled the requirements of the anti-abortion far-right [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=305.92s)]
*  So with the judges they were saying well, what happens if he appoints the wrong judges and what we did and I I just have it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=311.0s)]
*  we just took a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=318.14s)]
*  Judges and I thought what I would do is put this forward and this would be the list that I would either choose from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=320.88s)]
*  Or pick people very close in terms of the spirit and the meaning of what they represent and I came up with a list [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=326.68s)]
*  The Federalist Society was very much involved [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  Various people were involved. He's gotten very good reviews from its immediate release [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  It's got great reviews the people that have seen it have given it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=342.68s)]
*  So if you want I will yeah, I will do it now if you don't read them [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  I think I can read them. I don't I hope you people aren't gonna fall asleep as I read them [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  He read the list of names. I mean this was it again. This was a huge issue [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=354.48s)]
*  Remember people thought Trump maybe wasn't a stalwart conservative. He had skepticism of evangelicals [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  So the idea was just black and white like you're getting the judges and the justices that will overturn wrong [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=364.16s)]
*  He continued to add to the list and eventually again, maybe the only promise the man has kept in his life [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=370.56s)]
*  I brought honestly mean that he did what he said. He chose three names from the list [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=375.72s)]
*  They were all on the list Neil Gorsuch Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  Now at their confirmation hearings all three Trump appointees who were on the list who he said would overturn row [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=384.8s)]
*  McCoy when asked about how they would rule on abortion rights describing row as settled law [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=390.54s)]
*  Row versus Wade decided in 1973 [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Is a precedent United States Supreme Court [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=400.58s)]
*  It has been reaffirmed. I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=403.5s)]
*  Wade I don't have any agenda. I have no agenda to try to overrule Casey [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=411.18s)]
*  I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=416.05999999999995s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett got up there under oath and fernandes like I have no agenda to overturn row [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=423.26s)]
*  Sure, right, of course [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course Donald Trump's aims and his intentions in non English three justices were always clear [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=431.29999999999995s)]
*  Under my administration we will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=437.34s)]
*  And that is the right to life a tremendous record [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=444.98s)]
*  Including two great new Supreme Court justice's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. They'll be making tremendous and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=451.26s)]
*  important decisions on abortion the president also is opposed to Roe v [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  Wade that's on the ballot as well and the court in the court and so that's also at stake right now [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=464.14s)]
*  And so the election is all you know, it's on the ballot. Why is it in the ballot? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=470.48s)]
*  Because because it's not in the ballot. It's on the ballot in the court. I don't think so in the court [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, there's nothing happening there [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=480.68s)]
*  There's nothing happening there Donald Trump 2020 nothing happening there the guy who told us all along like you're getting Roe v [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  Wade overturned we're getting [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=490.44s)]
*  Anti-abortion justices when he gets it all there [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=492.56s)]
*  What are you doing? There's nothing out there and then in the June of 2022 Donald Trump's six year long plot succeeded [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=494.56s)]
*  His three justices who he had vetted who are on the list who he guaranteed would overturn Roe v [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=500.48s)]
*  Wade overturn Roe v. Wade eliminating the right to an abortion [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=505.48s)]
*  He brags about it now. I [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  Want to thank the Supreme Court justices for having the courage Clarence Thomas Samuel Alito [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=512.76s)]
*  John Roberts [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=520.36s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch Amy Coney Barrett for the wisdom and the courage to do this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=522.72s)]
*  But Donald Trump deserves all the credit [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=530.46s)]
*  He is the ultimate cause the man responsible for millions of American women living under dangerous [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=532.7800000000001s)]
*  Draconian abortion bans and if he's elected again, it will only get worse [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=538.58s)]
*  You [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--weUZNKzvs&t=559.46s)]
