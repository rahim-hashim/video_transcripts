# ‘Leave my salt alone’: RFK Jr. being praised for junk food concerns the right hated under Obama
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump won the election last week by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  successfully exploiting a key division among Americans, those who are for the system and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=4.12s)]
*  those who are against it, broadly put. President-elect managed to build a narrow majority with what [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=10.92s)]
*  you might call an anti-system coalition, people who are angry at our government, resentful [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=17.44s)]
*  of our institutions because they feel they have been failed by them. And lots of people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=22.3s)]
*  feel that for very good reason. And now he has chosen perhaps the most high profile figure [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=25.9s)]
*  in the anti-system world for a top job in his cabinet. Of course, I'm talking about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=32.22s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. That's Trump's new pick for Secretary of Department of Health and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=36.9s)]
*  Human Services. Now, Kennedy's a perfect example of the kind of complicated ideological stew [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=42.66s)]
*  that is the anti-system coalition. For most of his life, of course, like his family and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=48.1s)]
*  his dad, he was a Democrat. He was working as an environmental lawyer fighting to clean [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=52.78s)]
*  up pollution, protect against climate change, noble pursuits, good causes. Over the past [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=57.02s)]
*  couple of decades, Kennedy's views about science and health became a lot more complex, veering [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=61.7s)]
*  into some really very dangerous conspiracy theories, particularly about disease and vaccines [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=66.3s)]
*  in particular. He has a lot of opinions about a lot of topics. And I want to be fair and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=71.34s)]
*  try to be kind of even tempered here off the top because some of them, some of them are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=76.56s)]
*  perfectly defensible. As Dr. and writer Rachel Bedard explains in a piece of the New York [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=81.34s)]
*  Times today, R.F.K.'s argument, for instance, that the country under invests in interventions [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  that prevent chronic disease in favor of over treating patients with drugs once they've [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=90.58s)]
*  fallen ill has significant merit and is not especially controversial among health care [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=94.86s)]
*  providers. Democratic Governor Jared Polis of Colorado even went so far as to praise [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=99.46s)]
*  Kennedy's plan to eliminate the nutrition department at the Food and Drug Administration, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=103.82s)]
*  the entire nutrition regime is dominated by big corporate ag rather than human health, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=108.26s)]
*  and they do more harm than good. Again, there's the core of a really perfectly good critique [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=113.38s)]
*  there. And I'll say, I think it's clear to a lot of the folks in America, a lot of people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=118.14s)]
*  watching this, that our current food and health system is broken in some deep and fundamental [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=122.78s)]
*  ways. Our foods are full of sugar and chemical additives. Industrial farming, industrial ag [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=128.42s)]
*  cause incredible damage. A study just out this week finds that three quarters of U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=134.18s)]
*  adults are now overweight or obese. All of that is linked to chronic disease, including [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=138.42s)]
*  diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease. Life expectancy also continues to decline [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=142.38s)]
*  in the United States, but not in our peer countries, although a lot of that has to do [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=148.5s)]
*  with fentanyl and opioids. Again, none of this is a new critique. If you're like me [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=151.98s)]
*  and you spent most of your life on the progressive left, you've been sort of engaged with this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=157.1s)]
*  critique for decades. In fact, it just so happens 16 years ago, another incoming administration [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=161.62s)]
*  made health and food a key policy priority. Oh, and the right absolutely lost their mind [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=169.38s)]
*  about it. Tonight, your America is turning into a nanny state thanks to the Obama administration's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=177.38s)]
*  efforts to rein in the junk food industry. I don't need Michelle Obama telling me as [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=182.58s)]
*  a mother what I'm going to feed my kids. I don't need the government to fix obesity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=187.22s)]
*  I don't want the government telling me that I can't put salt on my food. Uh, isn't that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=191.78s)]
*  our job to have any role or responsibility in life anymore? I like junk food. I like [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=196.82s)]
*  McDonald's. I like Wendy's. I like Burger King. I love Kentucky fried chicken. I love [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=202.1s)]
*  Bruce Chris, my favorite steakhouse. Leave my salt and my McDonald's alone. Coming Bryant [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=207.5s)]
*  from my cold dead ends. Now, a lot of those same people are suddenly, I don't know why, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=213.5s)]
*  but all of a sudden taking those exact same ideas seriously now that they're coming from [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=218.94s)]
*  RFK Jr. We have this crisis in our food supply in this country. That's going to be a major [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=224.78s)]
*  focus of RFKs. In the United States, we have 42, almost 43% of adults now qualifying as [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=231.66s)]
*  police. I love RFK Jr. in this position because, Greg, we should be the healthiest country [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=240.66s)]
*  in the world, but we're the sickest country in the world. RFK Jr., to his credit, is the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=247.1s)]
*  right person to lead this effort at HHS. Now, can America do better on issues like obesity [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=252.34s)]
*  and heart disease and strokes and diabetes? Can we get rid of chemicals and hormones in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=258.94s)]
*  our food like Europe? You know, it is time to make America healthy again through accountability [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=264.26s)]
*  and through transparency. Sean Hannity is now on the let's regulate food the way the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=270.3s)]
*  Europeans do trade. Okay? Now that Trump ally, RFK says junk food and obesity are a problem, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  I guess it has, well, it has the thrill of dissident knowledge pushing against the system [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=283.94s)]
*  and the liberal elites. But of course, and here's the rub really, along with some of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=289.32s)]
*  these totally correct critiques of the status quo, the anti-system coalition that Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=294.98s)]
*  has built is also full of ludicrous, delusional, dangerous ideas. In Kennedy's case, there [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=300.06s)]
*  are a lot of them. There's no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective. I do believe [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=308.98s)]
*  that autism does come from vaccines. And they get the shot that night, they have a fever [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  on your brain and they go on to sleep three months later, their brains drop. COVID-19 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=321.1s)]
*  is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=325.66s)]
*  Askenazi Jews and Chinese. The agency, the USDA, the FDA have been captured by the industries [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  they're supposed to regulate. And they all have an interest in subsidies and then in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=343.94s)]
*  mass poisoning the American public. There's a lot of people that said it's not a virus. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  100% of the people who died in the first of the first thousand with AIDS were people who [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=355.18s)]
*  were addicted to poppers. They were people who were part of the gay lifestyle, where [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=361.78s)]
*  they were burning the candle at both ends and they were taking a lot of injectable drugs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=367.14s)]
*  They're putting in 5G to harvest our data and control our behavior. A lot of the problems [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=372.26s)]
*  we see in kids and particularly boys, it's probably underappreciated that how much of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  that is coming from chemical exposures, including a lot of the sexual dysphoria that we're seeing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=385.54s)]
*  I mean, they're swimming through a soup of toxic chemicals today. And many of those are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=391.14000000000004s)]
*  endocrine disruptors. I mean, where to start? I mean, I think my personal favorite might be [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=395.82s)]
*  that COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people and that the most immune are [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. It's a pretty decent one. Now, obviously all that is either just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=405.62s)]
*  flatly false or in some cases overstated so dramatically as to be deceptive. It's all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=410.82s)]
*  nutty and in a lot of cases just genuinely dangerous fear-mongering. They just corroded [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=419.46s)]
*  corrupted conspiratorial thinking. And Kennedy's most disqualifying statements, the reason that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=424.82s)]
*  him being appointed to HHS is so grave is his views on vaccines. And I don't want to overstate [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=431.3s)]
*  the case here. Vaccines are one of the five greatest achievements of human civilization, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=438.34s)]
*  bar none. In fact, we've got a pretty good recent example. Just four years ago, we managed to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=444.9s)]
*  develop a vaccine in the midst of a once in a century pandemic. It was the one unambiguously [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=452.41999999999996s)]
*  good achievement of Donald Trump's first term. It saved millions of lives, but the denialism [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=457.7s)]
*  of people like Robert F. Kennedy poisoned the minds of hundreds of thousands of more who could [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  have been saved, who refuse a vaccine and died. The death toll is astounding. I don't know if [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=469.3s)]
*  there's a movement with a bigger one in recent times. This is a person who should not be anywhere [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=477.78s)]
*  near a health system of any kind, certainly not in charge of the federal agency responsible [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=483.14s)]
*  for drug development and vaccines and the health of hundreds of millions of Americans. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  So yes, there is plenty wrong with our food and health systems in this country. There are plenty [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=494.41999999999996s)]
*  wrong with a lot of the systems in this country and the alienation people feel from them and the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  curiosity they feel towards folks that say it's screwed up is well-earned. But this dude, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=504.74s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr. is not the person to fix it. What he's going to do is break it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=512.42s)]
*  and break it so that we have something worse than what we have now. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqzhGqIrQ4&t=520.26s)]
