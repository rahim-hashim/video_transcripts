# ‘He’s alone’ Trump arraignment sees no family, no posse, no protests
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8)
*  Jen Psaki is the former White House press secretary for President Biden, is the host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=0.0s)]
*  of Inside with Jen Psaki on MSNBC. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=4.36s)]
*  Michael Beschloss is an NBC News presidential historian, and both of them join me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=6.7s)]
*  Jen, first, I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you today as you were watching it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=12.88s)]
*  I'm curious your reaction to today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=17.44s)]
*  You know, the bureau here is just a few blocks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I could walk to where the courthouse is, to where Garrett is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=24.52s)]
*  It's raining, but I could still walk there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=27.68s)]
*  And I think there was this expectation that it would be a circus, or I had that expectation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=29.78s)]
*  It really wasn't outside of the courthouse, a circus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=35.06s)]
*  And that speaks to how much things have changed in some ways over the last couple of years [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=38.6s)]
*  for the good, in part, I think, because of the efforts by the Department of Justice to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=43.1s)]
*  go after the oath keepers and disincentivize this type of gathering. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=47.66s)]
*  But the other thing that struck me, Chris, is that as much as we didn't see in the courtroom [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=52.34s)]
*  And as you noted in your opening, there were a lot of developments that came out of it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=56.099999999999994s)]
*  that I think were surprising. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=59.86s)]
*  I mean, Trump was treated like a teenager in some ways, not a 77-year-old former president. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=60.86s)]
*  But also that just listening, he seemed smaller in some ways to me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=68.06s)]
*  I mean, he didn't do a big campaign event. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=73.06s)]
*  He did have some remarks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=75.3s)]
*  He didn't go to a public event. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=76.82s)]
*  He didn't give a long speech. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=78.52s)]
*  You know, that was striking to me as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=80.66s)]
*  But also, we're going to learn more in a couple of weeks when the judge, who clearly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=82.92s)]
*  means business, moves forward on getting us a trial date. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=87.08s)]
*  That point on seeming smaller, I just want to add something to that because of talking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  with some of our colleagues here after the special coverage. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=95.12s)]
*  And it's notable that he's alone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=98.16s)]
*  There's no posse and there's no retinue and there's no family. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=100.92s)]
*  Like, I would hope if I were to go through the ordeal that this man is currently facing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  in my darkest hours, having to go, my wife and my kids and my loved ones and my friends, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  that I would have a crew, people that are standing there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  His wife is not there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  I can't see any of his kids, his daughter who weren't there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  No one. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=122.36s)]
*  The guy's alone. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=123.36s)]
*  He is solo rolling with the lawyers that are willing to take, you know, hope his checks [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=124.36s)]
*  clear. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=128.24s)]
*  And that is really striking Michael Beschloss on a day that, you know, is a huge day, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=129.24s)]
*  No matter how much I think he wants to say it isn't and, you know, this is a witch hunt [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=134.28s)]
*  I don't think there's any real analog in American history for what happened today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  Nothing remotely like it, Chris. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  And Chris, you and Jen and I, we all have children. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  Yours are two of you guys. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=151.8s)]
*  Yours are younger than mine are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  But I guarantee you that they will learn about what happened this day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=155.36s)]
*  And not only because it's the first time an ex-president was indicted for offenses that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=159.44s)]
*  he committed in office. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  But look at the consequence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=166.84s)]
*  Just as you were saying at the beginning, Chris, if this had succeeded, let's say some [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=168.24s)]
*  of those attackers in the Capitol had been about five or 10 minutes faster and gotten [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=172.88s)]
*  to Nancy Pelosi or got to Mike Pence or others. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=177.96s)]
*  Some of them had murder and kidnapping in their heart. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  Or let's say this trial got further delayed and didn't take place before the 2024 election [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=185.56s)]
*  and Donald Trump becomes president next year and he wants to finish the job that he did [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  not finish on the 6th of January with some kind of presidential dictatorship. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Aside from everything else, you know, we would lose our democracy as we almost did on the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  6th of December. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Rule of law, peaceful transfer of power, the way that we choose people to lead us. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, look at the emptiness that would be there in our system. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=214.7s)]
*  A president of the United States, Donald Trump, had committed perhaps the largest offense [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  that any president had come near to committing in all of our history. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=225.04s)]
*  Never had to pay for it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Came back to office. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-2GWZt_Y8&t=231.56s)]
