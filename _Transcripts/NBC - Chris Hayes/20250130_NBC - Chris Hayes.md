# ‘Focus is power’: Chris Hayes on covering Trump in the age of ‘the attention economy’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80)
*  The biggest challenge of covering Donald Trump, particularly on a day like today, is his way [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=0.0s)]
*  of dominating what's known as the attention economy, meaning who can hold people's short [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=5.4s)]
*  attention spans for any amount of time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=10.38s)]
*  A late night social media post throwing out red herrings or holding a weird press conference [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=13.08s)]
*  to further his baseless lies about an airline crash. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=17.54s)]
*  It's giving inject disinfectant vibes all over again, by the way. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=21.56s)]
*  And by the time that you catch up and fact check one thing, he's on to the next. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=25.82s)]
*  Add to that the blizzard of staged executive orders, so you barely notice that what his [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=30.02s)]
*  administration is actually doing is stumbling, bumbling and failing, issuing nonsensical [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  orders that they then have to walk back and sending federal agencies and state to state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=40.14s)]
*  governments scrambling in a panic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=44.74s)]
*  It's frankly exhausting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=47.5s)]
*  But nowadays, the truth is that the real power in this world is in the hands of those who [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  can control that attention economy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=53.98s)]
*  And unfortunately, the Magorite is really good at it since Trump and nearly everyone [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=56.739999999999995s)]
*  he's put in key positions are former reality TV personalities, Fox hosts or podcasters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  My friend and colleague, Chris Hayes, host of All In has written a great new book about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=67.38s)]
*  just that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=71.18s)]
*  It's called The Sirens Call, how attention became the world's most endangered resource. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=72.18s)]
*  And Chris joins me now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=77.5s)]
*  Chris, I've got the book in my hot little hand. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=78.74s)]
*  I want it signed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=80.62s)]
*  Did I explain the attention economy correctly? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=82.5s)]
*  And if I did not, please explain it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=84.7s)]
*  No, I think you're exactly right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=86.1s)]
*  I mean, I think that basically the concede here is that attention is the world's most [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=87.38s)]
*  important resource. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=91.06s)]
*  And it's the most important thing both in commercial life, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=92.06s)]
*  All those tech billionaires on stage with Trump are people that basically run attention [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=96.26s)]
*  companies, whether it's Apple or it's X or it's Metta or it's Google. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=100.38s)]
*  And then in public life. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think we see how Trump's domination of attention has been kind of his superpower, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=108.26s)]
*  even though it comes with its own cost. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=114.06s)]
*  And yes, in the last day, look at this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Last night, there was tremendous attention on the most deadly air crash we've had in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=119.22000000000001s)]
*  years, a horrible tragedy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=124.34s)]
*  Trump's immediate thought was how to basically surf off that attention, how to use that attention [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  and how to push it in the direction he wants towards people of color and women are the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=134.3s)]
*  problem. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=139.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=140.5s)]
*  And so you've seen just this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=141.5s)]
*  And you know, most most politicians would be told, don't go out speculating and saying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=143.3s)]
*  things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=149.38s)]
*  That's it's not good for the investigation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=150.38s)]
*  It's actually probably not good politically. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=151.5s)]
*  It sounds tone deaf and weird. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  You'll get blowback. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=154.94s)]
*  His North Star is what will maximize the amount of tension on me and on the things I want [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=156.74s)]
*  at any given moment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=161.5s)]
*  Man, is that on display in the last 24 hours? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=163.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to read you to you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=165.7s)]
*  I'm going to read your same book to you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=166.7s)]
*  Trump cares deeply about being admired. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=168.5s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  But he's such a broken person, his psychological needs so bottomless that he'll take attention [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  in whatever form he can get. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=176.42s)]
*  He'll take condemnation, rebuke, disgust as long as you are thinking about him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=178.22s)]
*  Being willing to court negative attention at the cost of persuasion is really Donald [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump's one simple trick for hacking attention age public discourse. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=186.9s)]
*  I found that exact same thing when I did my Trump book is that every person I talked to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  said the same thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=194.66s)]
*  He just cannot live outside the spotlight for one second. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=195.66s)]
*  It's always got to be on him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=198.62s)]
*  It's neediness. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=199.82s)]
*  How do we manage that as journalists when we have to deal with this man? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=200.82s)]
*  And that is I think that is such a conundrum because it presents this sort of trolls conundrum, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=203.78s)]
*  right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=209.18s)]
*  That that that you could just ignore him today, but he's the president of the United States [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=210.18s)]
*  who's trying to essentially blame women and racial minorities for a deadly air crash based [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  on absolutely nothing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=221.58s)]
*  So it's actually important to tell the truth about what happened and what we know, like [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  you did in your block and what the context is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=226.86s)]
*  And so, you know, ignoring doesn't quite work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=230.18s)]
*  I think the key here is paying attention and focusing on the things that we all think matter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=233.86s)]
*  and not being whipped around constantly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=240.34s)]
*  So one of the things I've been telling myself and write about the book is that like focus [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=244.66s)]
*  is power and it's hard to focus. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=247.46s)]
*  You saw, I mean, they didn't schedule Cash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard and R.F.K. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=249.54s)]
*  Jr. three of their most controversial nominees on the same day. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=253.26s)]
*  Accidentally, right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=256.5s)]
*  They did it precisely to divide focus. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=258.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=260.5s)]
*  So what we have to do both as citizens and as journalists is find ways to focus. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=261.5s)]
*  And that means some we're not going to get to everything. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=266.58s)]
*  I think you and I are both wrestling with this in this first days about how to deal [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=268.98s)]
*  with it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=273.34s)]
*  And it's also about Democrats and other folks who are opposed to Trump finding ways to get [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=274.58s)]
*  attention from themselves. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=280.86s)]
*  I mean, that's the other thing is that the world we live in, in which this resource is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=281.86s)]
*  so precious, so contested and so fought over, that is the context in which politics happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=286.02s)]
*  You can't just pretend it's not that that way or not deal with these attentional imperatives. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=291.24s)]
*  And I think sometimes Democrats sometimes understandably want to just put their head [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=296.84s)]
*  down and do work. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  But the world doesn't quite work that way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  Politics don't work that way at all. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, the Democrats who are good at it, right, the Jasmine Crockett and the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=307.76s)]
*  AOCs normally get set aside by the older Democrats who want to still do things the old way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  And it doesn't work at all. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I do want to throw in one other thing that you do write about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk is basically a different version of Donald Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=321.32s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=323.76s)]
*  He essentially, you write, took over Twitter, right, just in order to force everyone to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=324.76s)]
*  pay attention to him all the time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=329.48s)]
*  If you're on that app, ex Twitter is literally just his microphone and it's all about him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=331.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=336.28s)]
*  And in the same way that I think from Trump, Trump's deep brokenness led him to this insight [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=337.28s)]
*  that he backed into because he just needs attention so desperately. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=342.68s)]
*  It's not like he theorized it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=345.8s)]
*  The same thing happened to Musk. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=348.32s)]
*  I mean, Musk really, some part of him I think broke from being online and he backed into [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=349.32s)]
*  it too and he lit billions of dollars on fire. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=354.04s)]
*  But what he backed into in the same way Trump backed into it because of their psychological [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=356.36s)]
*  brokenness was the insight that if you pull enough attention together, you have vast power. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=360.14s)]
*  You can make fortunes out of it and you can make political fortune out of it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=366.12s)]
*  And now here's this guy who has managed to do that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=369.54s)]
*  He's bought this attention platform. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=372.08s)]
*  He's made himself the main character and now he is utilizing that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=374.58s)]
*  He's converting that both into cash in the prices of his stocks because of the power [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=377.88s)]
*  and political power because of the proximity he has to the president of the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=382.08s)]
*  And like Trump, he doesn't care if it's negative or positive attention, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=386.64s)]
*  His little salute thing, he's like, I'm just going to ride even that even though that's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  the most possible negative attention you could get. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DRH92gM80&t=395.12s)]
