# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 24
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s)
*  Do you remember that time that billionaire Elon Musk unveiled the new Tesla cyber truck, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=0.0s)]
*  and when he went to demonstrate the vehicle's supposedly bulletproof glass, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=4.0s)]
*  they smashed two of its windows even though they weren't supposed to break? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=8.0s)]
*  Today's Twitter rollout of the Rob DeSantis campaign went kinda like that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=11.0s)]
*  Now it's quiet. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=17.0s)]
*  We want to welcome you to this historic Twitter Spaces event, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=19.0s)]
*  and more broadly a first in the history of social media. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=22.0s)]
*  Tonight I'm pleased to introduce two individuals who have done more to loosen the grip [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=25.0s)]
*  Sorry about that. We've got so many people here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=29.0s)]
*  So let's see. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=34.0s)]
*  It's like they just keep crashing, huh? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=36.0s)]
*  Well it's certainly an incredible honor to have Governor DeSantis make this stark announcement. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=38.0s)]
*  Yo, it was like 20 minutes of that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=44.0s)]
*  Trump had the golden escalator, Ron DeSantis got the world's most embarrassing 404 error. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=51.0s)]
*  Over 20 minutes of technical difficulties that sounded like this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=58.0s)]
*  That is how the Florida Governor's big entrance to the Republican presidential primary will be forever remembered. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=62.0s)]
*  DeSantis chose to launch his campaign not during a campaign rally, not on a televised event, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=68.0s)]
*  but on Twitter.com with Elon Musk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=73.0s)]
*  And why? Maybe because Musk and Twitter are the best audience for the DeSantis brand Crusade Against Woke. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=76.0s)]
*  I view the wokeness as a form of cultural Marxism. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=85.0s)]
*  I think it goes back to this woke mind virus that's infected the left and all these other institutions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=89.0s)]
*  We will never surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=95.0s)]
*  DeSantis now officially a 2024 contender is knee deep in this kind of impenetrable sphere of contemporary right-wing online culture war fights. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=102.0s)]
*  Fighting the woke mind virus aligns quite well with Twitter. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=110.0s)]
*  Its new owner, Elon Musk, has turned the platform into a right-wing forum where he also rails against the woke mind virus, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=113.0s)]
*  the same ideology embraced by DeSantis. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=119.0s)]
*  Florida Governor, who is apparently trapped in this online cultural woke bubble, has chosen, for example, to fight with Disney for daring to speak out against him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=122.0s)]
*  Even one of his speechwriters, a guy that he chose to hire, has effusively praised notorious white nationalist Nick Fuentes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=131.0s)]
*  That's the guy that's writing his words. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=138.0s)]
*  I can't tell you for sure, but it does not sound like Ron DeSantis' messaging is necessarily resonating with the Republican electorate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=141.0s)]
*  Two new polls released today showed DeSantis trailing Donald Trump by roughly 30 points. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=148.0s)]
*  Florida Republican strategist Tim Miller recently pointed out DeSantis' campaign is a lot like Senator Elizabeth Warren's failed 2020 campaign, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=153.0s)]
*  which relied on a smaller version of the electorate, a narrow but vocal audience. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=161.0s)]
*  Tim Miller is a former RNC spokesman and current writer at large for the bulwark. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=166.0s)]
*  Debbie Moore-Crissell Powell is a former Democratic congresswoman in Florida. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=170.0s)]
*  Both join me now. Tim, let me start with you and let me say something you say in the piece, which is that the point you're making, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=173.0s)]
*  the comparison, is by no means substantive at all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=178.0s)]
*  It's purely at this level of like where you're trying to fit in the primer. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=180.0s)]
*  And one of the points you make is Elizabeth Warren was sort of had this campaign that was electric to a certain portion of the Democratic base. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=184.0s)]
*  That proved not to be big enough to win the primary. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=193.0s)]
*  You think DeSantis is the same problem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=197.0s)]
*  And before we get to that, oh my God, can you believe what happened? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=199.0s)]
*  Well, I'm just thrilled because I don't know if you remember, but I was part of the John Huntsman presidential campaign announcement. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=203.0s)]
*  We misspelled our candidate's own name on the credentials. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=209.0s)]
*  We spelled it J-O-H-N, which to me was so shameful and embarrassing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=214.0s)]
*  And by comparison, we crushed it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=218.0s)]
*  So thank you to the Ron DeSantis team for making our little small gaff there look very manageable by comparison, because that was just an epic disaster. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=220.0s)]
*  I don't like you, Chris. I'm a Twitter addict. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=231.0s)]
*  It took me a while to figure out how to get in because because the first two or three faces, they started crashed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=234.0s)]
*  So I was like in an old one just listening to random ringing noises and people whispering. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=240.0s)]
*  I know it was an utter disaster. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=245.0s)]
*  Half the audience disappeared by the time they got it going. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=248.0s)]
*  And the messaging and I think this speaks to Elizabeth Warren thing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=251.0s)]
*  And like you said, this is not this is not about the substance. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=254.0s)]
*  This is about from a strategic standpoint. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=256.0s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, I think, made a mistake, you know, thinking that she could triple down on the very excited college educated progressive base and what their concerns were and spoke in their language. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=258.0s)]
*  You know, whereas Joe Biden was more successful reaching out to a broader part of the Democratic coalition, and he ends up winning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=270.0s)]
*  DeSantis now is stuck. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=275.0s)]
*  He's in this Twitter space with David Sachs and Elon Musk to to a hundred millionaire and a billionaire who don't like their fellow rich tech people because they think they're too woke. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=277.0s)]
*  They have all these weird concerns about digital currency and ESG and board woke board stuff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=288.0s)]
*  And they're talking about this in this in this Twitter space. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=295.0s)]
*  And it's like, well, I mean, an average mega voter living in Spartanburg, South Carolina, first can't get into the space. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=299.0s)]
*  If they could, all they heard was ringing noises. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=306.0s)]
*  And then if they finally made it in, they're listening to these three rich white guys like talk about a very niche concern of super wealthy college educated Republican contrarians. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=309.0s)]
*  And there's aren't enough of those to win a primary. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=320.0s)]
*  I can promise you that much. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=322.0s)]
*  Well, and it's interesting to that Trump keeps saying like he wants to cut Social Security like Trump says, like, you want you want to vote for the guy wants to cut Social Security Medicare. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=324.0s)]
*  That's what this guy wants to do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=331.0s)]
*  This guy wants to do. It's like, yeah, people don't want to that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=332.0s)]
*  That has a broad appeal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=335.0s)]
*  You know, that's the kind of thing that appeals across. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=336.0s)]
*  There's also Debbie, you know, you and I spoke about this when we were when I was in when I was in Florida of just who this guy is a candidate. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=339.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a choice here to court mosque and to do this audio only. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=346.0s)]
*  But you think you want to create some set piece where he's he looks commanding or he's giving a good speech. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=350.0s)]
*  And I wonder what you think of just his ability as a communicator outside of the sphere of the Twitter space is bubble when it was working, which it sort of barely did. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=358.0s)]
*  I mean, the announcement was so well staged. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=367.0s)]
*  He basically was reading from a piece of paper the announcement and all the questions that were asked were obviously pre prepared questions that he had prepared answer for. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=371.0s)]
*  I mean, the man cannot communicate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=381.0s)]
*  Well, he cannot connect with a larger audience. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=383.0s)]
*  He cannot answer tough questions. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=386.0s)]
*  And so this reminded me really, Chris, of state sponsored propaganda. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=388.0s)]
*  I feel like it was a dissenters mosque propaganda machine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=393.0s)]
*  It was a massive spread of misinformation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=397.0s)]
*  They they use this platform to talk falsely about covid, which, as you mentioned, really affected millions of Americans and left millions dead because of the virus. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=400.0s)]
*  They spread misinformation about the state of the economy here in the state of Florida. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=411.0s)]
*  We just lost a two billion dollar investment and more than 2000 jobs because he's anti business. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=415.0s)]
*  He attacks and harasses businesses that are against his ideology. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=421.0s)]
*  And we have an affordability crisis. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=425.0s)]
*  Our families are suffering an affordability crisis and he's done nothing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=427.0s)]
*  He is pushing a MAGA agenda and attacking the freedoms of our floor Floridians all over the state. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=432.0s)]
*  It's so interesting, Debbie, because what you just said, some of that is literally in the bill in particular is that Trump has used against DeSantis. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=438.0s)]
*  And again, they're probably those folks are probably not going to hear here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=445.0s)]
*  They're not going to hear from you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=448.0s)]
*  But again, Trump has proven a feral instinct instinct for the political rhetoric and particularly weakness of the people he's against him, particularly in a Republican primary. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=449.0s)]
*  And I just think that like there is going to be a little bit of talking past each other as things are set up right now. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=461.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=466.0s)]
*  Well, let me just also mention that the Trump campaign right now has the former DeSantis campaign manager, so she knows him very, very well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=467.0s)]
*  And the truth is that Ron DeSantis was in Congress. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=476.0s)]
*  He was one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus and he supported ending Medicare, cutting Social Security, repealing the Affordable Care Act. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=479.0s)]
*  And so he has every right to attack DeSantis on that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=487.0s)]
*  Tim, what do you think? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=490.0s)]
*  This is what people don't remember about the Trump 2016 campaign, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=493.0s)]
*  Is he was so extreme on certain issues, but he talked about things that your average talk radio call in base voter cared about. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=497.0s)]
*  He was willing to go against the dorky National Review orthodoxies on conservative issues and talk about things like Social Security. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=504.0s)]
*  And I just think that DeSantis is working right into the same trap that Ted Cruz is at on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=511.0s)]
*  Yes, dorky, neurotic online obsessives who need to go outside and grill something and touch grass like normal people and stop obsessing over whatever the heck Target sold. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=515.0s)]
*  Tim Miller and Debbie Mucraso-Powell, thank you very much. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=526.0s)]
*  Hearings are now underway for the Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges for their participation January 6th. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=530.0s)]
*  Today, a federal judge heard victim statements, including from Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who said he continues to seek therapy, quote, to learn how to heal from January 6th. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=539.0s)]
*  He's taken such a toll on me, as well as Virginia Brown, who was just a college student working as a Senate assistant seen here on the right, carrying the actual physical electoral ballots right before the attack. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=549.0s)]
*  He said in court, quote, I constantly relive the memories of that day. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=562.0s)]
*  I cannot measure how many hours of sleep I've lost. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=566.0s)]
*  Prosecutors are asking the judge for what would be the longest sentences yet in all the January 6 cases, including 25 years for Oath Keeper founder Elmer Stewart-Rose III on the right and 21 years for member Kelly Meggs. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=569.0s)]
*  Prosecutors say that they, along with seven other Oath Keepers, played a, quote, central and damning role in the attack on American democracy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=582.0s)]
*  And as a co-conspirator recognized, these actions made these defendants traitors. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=590.0s)]
*  NBC News justice reporter Ryan Riley was in the courtroom today and he joins me now. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=595.0s)]
*  Ryan, it's great to have you. What was today's hearing and what was it like in there? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, to me, the thing that really stood out was that Virginia Brown testimony, just because it's something that we really haven't heard before. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=605.0s)]
*  And just, you know, just if you step back for a moment and think about this young woman's life, you know, she was someone who, if you just do the math, was born after 9-11. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=610.0s)]
*  You know, probably spent her entire life going through these sort of drills that we've seen, you know, that kids who go to school have to go through these days to prepare for [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=619.0s)]
*  disastrous incidents and then talked about how she, you know, took off her shoes and was running for her life, you know, during this attack on the Capitol. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=628.0s)]
*  And this was someone who was had just, you know, I think was a freshman probably in college when when the covid-19 pandemic started and then, you know, gets this experience of working in the Senate and then has this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=636.0s)]
*  horrific incident happen to her there. And, you know, what was striking, I mean, the composure that she kept in in court, you know, and it just it was really, I think, emotional for a lot of the people who were there, including [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=647.0s)]
*  some of the testimony that we saw from officers as well as from Nancy Pelosi's staff. But, you know, I was in another sentencing hearing and it is this kind of thing where you can get a little bit sort of just like used to this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=658.0s)]
*  And, you know, OK, how many times are we going to hear this at some point? And one of the one thing that the prosecutor made a point of mentioning in this other hearing was that, you know, the officers are getting tired of doing this, too. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=671.0s)]
*  You know, two of the right. Some of the times we don't have victims who actually speak in these things because this has been two years of them having to go in court over and over again and tell and tell these stories and make sure that they're held accountable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=683.0s)]
*  And it's really important work, but it can also be quite a grind, I think, for these officers who have gone through a lot and have to relive that day over and over again. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=694.0s)]
*  I was struck by the some of the language throughout this trial, right, that that that seditious conspiracy and the kind of almost sort of symbolic or rhetorical role it plays in the conversation about what happened that day. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=701.0s)]
*  There was an actual conspiracy to overthrow the government, you know, according to the law, according to this conviction and the penalties that the government are seeking here are really the high. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=716.0s)]
*  Am I right? Like the highest for any of the folks that have been convicted so far. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=725.0s)]
*  How does the government justify and ask for 25 years, which is, you know, there are people who do less than that for homicide. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=731.0s)]
*  I think with Rhodes, it's really about the rhetoric. I mean, he was just so out there with some of the rhetoric and talking about what he wanted to do beforehand, as well as Kelly makes Kelly makes especially has a lot of really just violent rhetoric about in the lead up to January six and the pre planning that they were doing for this. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=739.0s)]
*  I think, you know, honestly, we're going to hear quite something from Rhodes tomorrow. It's sort of I was thinking about other terrorism sort of related cases. And, you know, there's this idea of not wanting to spread propaganda from terrorists. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=754.0s)]
*  That's a big thing from from courts and like, how is that really going to play out tomorrow? Because he's going to use this moment to really make as much of a stand as he can. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=766.0s)]
*  He's already been doing it and whatever sort of spaces he can he can bring out. But I think that this is going to be his real moment. You know, there's not going to be cameras in the courtroom, so it's not going to be something that's going to be broadcast on live television. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=775.0s)]
*  But, you know, you're really going to wonder what kind of message he's going to come out from this because he wants to go down like he thinks of himself as Nelson Mandela. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=785.0s)]
*  So he's going to really make this as much of a moment as he can, I think, and probably outside of what his lawyers would want him to say, because, you know, I mean, even if he gets a 20 year sentence, we're basically really going to have to do something about it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=792.0s)]
*  Bordering on life for him, right? Like that's that's that's basically a life sentence, essentially. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=805.0s)]
*  So it's going to be really, I think, interesting to see how this ends up playing out and whether or not you make this as final, you know, stand and tries to potentially rally other people to do similar things to what the Oath Keepers did on January 6th. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it would be a life something close to a life sentence, of course, pending the possibility of a future pardon by President Donald Trump, which the president has, if not specifically floored about him, definitely entertained multiple times. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=824.0s)]
*  Ryan Reilly, thank you very much. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=836.0s)]
*  Over raising the debt ceiling continues and approaches some kind of deadline. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=839.0s)]
*  It's helpful to understand that there's a reason why this is such favorable terrain for Republicans and why it is so dangerous for all of us. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=842.0s)]
*  It's a basic public opinion problem. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=850.0s)]
*  When you ask the public, and this is true for decades, as long as I've been covering politics, when you ask the public generally in the abstract, is federal, is the federal government spending too much? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=852.0s)]
*  You tend to get a resounding yes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=861.0s)]
*  Recent poll, for example, found 60% of US adults said, yes, we are spending too much. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=863.0s)]
*  But then when you ask people about specific programs, you get a very different answer. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=868.0s)]
*  In the exact same poll, 65% said there are too little spending on education. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=872.0s)]
*  63% said there's too little spending on health care. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=877.0s)]
*  62% say the same on Social Security infrastructure. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=880.0s)]
*  59% say the same on assistance to the poor. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=884.0s)]
*  58% on Medicare. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=887.0s)]
*  People don't actually want spending cuts. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=889.0s)]
*  They like these programs. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=891.0s)]
*  In fact, they want to spend more on them. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=892.0s)]
*  And so, of course, what Republicans have somewhat successfully engineered in this debt ceiling fight is a kind of national debate around the broad idea of spending too much as opposed to a debate about cutting specific things. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=894.0s)]
*  Last month, for example, they passed this ridiculous bill proposing just that, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=908.0s)]
*  Cutting federal discretionary spending to the level of the last fiscal year, imposing an arbitrary overall 1% cap on growth, all of it devoid of specifics, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=913.0s)]
*  These are just top lines, numbers. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=923.0s)]
*  And now the negotiations on those all-important details are happening behind closed doors, which also favors them because they don't have to defend individual cuts. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=925.0s)]
*  Now they have to decide, well, what are we actually going to cut to get those nice round numbers? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=934.0s)]
*  And the items on the chopping block really tell you how deranged this entire enterprise is. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=938.0s)]
*  Listen to me here. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=945.0s)]
*  Republicans reportedly want to cut the vaccine development program. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=947.0s)]
*  $5 billion of funding intended for the next generation of coronavirus vaccines and treatments. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=952.0s)]
*  The program, called Project Next Gen, aims to fund the development of new vaccines that could potentially offer longer lasting protection against a wider array of coronavirus variants or better defense against infections. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=958.0s)]
*  It also intends to fund the development of pan coronavirus vaccines, which would protect against different coronaviruses and new monoclonal antibody treatments. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=972.0s)]
*  This is a program that builds on Donald Trump's single unambiguous success, Operation Warp Seed, that helped to develop the COVID vaccines in record time. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=983.0s)]
*  The vaccines saved 20 million lives around the world just in their first year. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=993.0s)]
*  Just think for a moment. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1000.0s)]
*  We all live this, okay? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1002.0s)]
*  It was just a few years ago, the sheer human misery, illness, death, cost, trauma that could be avoided by investing a tiny portion of the federal budget, I mean tiny, into preparing for the next coronavirus outbreak, the next pandemic. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1004.0s)]
*  Imagine having a vaccine that protected you from all coronaviruses. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1020.0s)]
*  I literally cannot think of a better bang for the buck. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1024.0s)]
*  But that's what they're going to chop. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1028.0s)]
*  Because of course, this is what it looks like when you get down to the details. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1030.0s)]
*  The Republican negotiators have essentially taken 85% of the budget off the table, including things like defense spending and Social Security. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1035.0s)]
*  There's a pretty small portion left to work with. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1042.0s)]
*  And again, we can't forget the key context here. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1045.0s)]
*  Over the past couple years, the American right and the Republican Party have collapsed into a vortex of anti-vaccine nonsense that is dangerous, disastrous, and disconnected from reality. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1048.0s)]
*  They have decided the single greatest achievement of the Trump presidency, perhaps the greatest health intervention of our time, was actually some sort of malevolent plot. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1061.0s)]
*  And that anti-vax movement is an outgrowth of the insane neurotic universe of extremely online conservatives who spend all day slinging disinformation and offensive memes at each other. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1071.0s)]
*  The figurehead of that movement, of course, is the weirdest and most extremely online right winger of them all, Elon Musk. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1083.0s)]
*  And their candidate is the anti-vaccine crusader, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1090.0s)]
*  Well, tonight, the two of them met for a truly epically disastrous online launch-ish of DeSantis' presidential campaign. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1095.0s)]
*  All of the truly amazing details next. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1105.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZkvFwEb8s&t=1125.0s)]
