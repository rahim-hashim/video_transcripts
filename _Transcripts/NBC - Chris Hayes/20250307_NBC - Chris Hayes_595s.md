# New email reveals Trump’s aggressive new claim of executive power: TPM
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU)
*  What Elon Musk has been doing with his Doge team is, to my mind, an obviously illegal assault on the federal government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's totally in violation of the Constitution and the law. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=6.16s)]
*  It's also wildly destructive to people, just hacking away and making mistakes left and right and center. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=9.24s)]
*  And it's gotten so bad that even MAGA Republicans, who support slashing the government in principle, are starting to get real, real anxious. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=15.68s)]
*  New York Times describes what happened behind closed doors yesterday when simmering anger at the billionaire's unchecked power spilled out in a remarkable cabinet room meeting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=24.04s)]
*  The president quickly moved to rein in Mr. Musk. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=32.88s)]
*  In one exchange, described at the Times, Transportation Secretary, former Real World cast member Sean Duffy, squared off with Musk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=35.76s)]
*  Mr. Duffy said the young staff of Mr. Musk's team was trying to lay off air traffic controllers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=42.8s)]
*  What am I supposed to do? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=48.8s)]
*  Mr. Duffy said, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=50.16s)]
*  Mr. Musk told Mr. Duffy that his assertion was a lie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=57.36s)]
*  Mr. Duffy insisted it was not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=60.67999999999999s)]
*  He had heard it from them directly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  At another point, Mr. Musk insisted that people hired under diversity, equity and inclusion programs were working in control towers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Duffy pushed back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=70.36s)]
*  And Mr. Musk did not add details, but said during the longer back and forth that Mr. Duffy had his phone number, should call him if he had any issues to raise. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=71.88s)]
*  The exchange ended with Mr. Trump telling Mr. Duffy that he had to hire people from MIT as air traffic controllers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=79.88s)]
*  These air traffic controllers need to be geniuses, he said. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=87.72s)]
*  Oh, there's so much there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=92.6s)]
*  And it's not just cabinet members who are starting to have some unease about Musk and his methods. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=93.6s)]
*  Joining me now, someone who's been closely tracking Musk's illegal assaults on the American government, Josh Marshall, founder and editor in chief of Talking Points Memo. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=97.84s)]
*  Josh, you've been you've been reporting on this at your great outlet, your great independent journalistic outlet, which is doing great work. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=106.0s)]
*  Talking Points Memo. Thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=112.24s)]
*  And I feel like you've we've been on the same wavelength, which is the entire construct of this thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=113.56s)]
*  Someone described it as not unconstitutional, but anti-constitutional, that it's it's just so clearly beyond the pale of the founders, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=119.16s)]
*  constitutional structure. And one of the clarifying moments before we get to the cabinet was the senators and members of Congress, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=127.0s)]
*  which was a day earlier, being like, what about all this stuff? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=133.32s)]
*  And must saying, you can call me. You've got a direct line if we mess up and you need to reestablish some funding. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=138.04s)]
*  And you're basically like, that's not how this all works. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's an understatement. I mean, you had this very you know, there's there's one issue of why do only Republicans get to be involved in the government now? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=148.32s)]
*  But set that aside, you have this very perverse situation where you have Congress, the budget setting authority, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=155.84s)]
*  the one that makes a law that is the budget, that is the appropriations saying, can we get that one thing back? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, they're going hat in hand to this guy who's not even an appointee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=169.52s)]
*  That part, first of all, is just is just bizarre. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=175.2s)]
*  That is not that is the total anti of how anything is supposed to work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=177.88s)]
*  And then the party you just mentioned with the cabinet secretaries, they're begging. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=182.12s)]
*  And you start thinking back of like, where who is this? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=186.28s)]
*  You know, we all saw a schoolhouse rock, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=189.4s)]
*  There's the president and there's the Congress. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=191.92s)]
*  And who's this new player that is not really any of them? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  Right. I mean, the whole thing is bizarre. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=198.72s)]
*  And you're right. It's not there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=201.64s)]
*  There are various things that are that are unconstitutional. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=203.48s)]
*  But you could sort of imagine there might have been a slightly different constitution and it might have been this that way. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=207.32s)]
*  But there's nothing where you would have had this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  Like, let's just find this random dude from the outside who has nothing to do with anything, but he is in charge of everything. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=215.68s)]
*  That makes no sense at all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=222.28s)]
*  That's a great point. Right. The Article One congressional branch, they don't have the power of the person anymore because Elon Musk has it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=223.92s)]
*  In fact, this is this is what I love this idea from that meeting that you were writing about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=229.76s)]
*  And I've been thinking about some senators. These are Republican senators only were given Musk phone number during Wednesday's meeting. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  The entrepreneur said he would create a system where members of Congress can call some central group to get problematic cuts reverse quickly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=240.64s)]
*  It's like, guys, I got news for you. You're the system. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  Congress is the central system that decides that they're not they're not in power. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=250.0s)]
*  But even Article Two, that the cabinet is not in power, Senate confirmed who are in the in the Constitution, they're apparently not in power. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=254.44s)]
*  And Sean Duffy sounds like an MSNBC host saying you want me to fire air traffic controllers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=262.64s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, I hadn't seen Sean said that yet, man. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=267.96s)]
*  I'm going to run with that quote tomorrow. Right. That's that's amazing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=270.96s)]
*  But yes, it is. It's so perverse. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=274.44s)]
*  And and the one thing you get to and what really came out, you know, I was quoting from an earlier piece in The Washington Post, but about the same meetings with up on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=277.52s)]
*  And what's so strange is there's one point where they say on the one hand, they're saying, hey, we got to take charge back here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  We're Congress. You need to run this by us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=296.04s)]
*  And then there's this transition in that piece where the post-author say, but it's not so clear that the Congress actually wants to vote on this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=299.12s)]
*  That's right. Or if they're prepared. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=308.48s)]
*  And that is the sort of the epiphany moment because everything starts to come together there where you where you see that they want to be out of the loop. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  Because there was this one thing where Nick Baggott, the freshman congressman from Alaska, he flies back into Alaska, some people kind of catch him there at the airport and they're saying, this is terrible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=320.28s)]
*  And he's saying, hey, I'm out of the loop. I can't do anything about it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=333.92s)]
*  I just I'm just in Congress. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=337.48s)]
*  And and that is kind of on the one hand, you say, oh, that's crazy and everything. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=339.64s)]
*  But that is what they want here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=344.32s)]
*  Because if you if your Congress and you want to say, hey, we're going to cut all these things, then you've got to pass a bill and you've got to write it down. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  And then you have to say, do you want to vote for it or against it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  And when you vote for it, then there's going to be an election. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  And you start to see how all of this comes together where everybody wants to be out of the loop. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=361.96s)]
*  That's right. The president's out of the loop. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=368.08s)]
*  Congress is out of the loop. And it kind of works for everybody. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's the he's the hit man. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=373.84s)]
*  He's the hatchet man. He's the he's doing the dirty work. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=376.28s)]
*  Right. And everyone else can just be like, I don't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=379.52s)]
*  You know, and and he and he never has to stand for election. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=382.56s)]
*  Right. So it's a sort of it's a perfect. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=385.76s)]
*  And then you have this great scoop today, which is about, again, these sort of insane assertions of authority, this kind of authoritarian push, this sort of anti-constitutional authority. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=387.64s)]
*  You got a scoop today about a claim that Trump is now making. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  Basically, their position is that any independent agency under the Constitution is not independent and actually Trump could do whatever he wants. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=401.92s)]
*  And they wrote this memo with this tiny little aid agency for African development, which was actually created by statute 1980. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=410.8s)]
*  We covered them yesterday, how their their staff wouldn't let the doge backpack boys in. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=417.12s)]
*  Although today they showed up in the U.S. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=421.64s)]
*  Marshall and got in. But in this memo, describe to me what their theory of executive authority is. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, we all know that and many right wing judges think that the president has these inherent authority authorities to kind of a point fire anybody. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=429.8s)]
*  OK, that's one thing. But then there's a question. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=439.12s)]
*  How can you appoint? OK. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=442.12s)]
*  Now, there are specifics about this one agency, this foundation that Congress accepted them from the law that allows all of those actings. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=444.24s)]
*  And you can do this. They can see that acting. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. OK. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=458.32s)]
*  So everything defaults back to the plain old Constitution, which is that the Senate has to confirm. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=459.56s)]
*  So in this in this email to a member of the board of that agency, a White House staffer said, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=465.96s)]
*  we can't we can't have the Vacancies Act won't help us. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=473.96s)]
*  So we're down to the appointments clause, which, again, Senate consent. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=478.88s)]
*  And he said, we can't work with that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=484.24s)]
*  So he basically says in this memo, the appointments clause, a part of the Constitution is itself unconstitutional. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=486.48s)]
*  Because Trump's inherent power just can't work with it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=496.16s)]
*  It's too big for the both of us. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=500.68s)]
*  Constitution. Right. Basically, he writes, he writes this staffer writes the appointments clause that is in the Constitution about how [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=502.0s)]
*  appoints have been out of the Constitution because it conflicts with the inherent authority of the president. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=509.64000000000004s)]
*  The United States, the appointments clause, that's in the text of the Constitution. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're basically saying this one part of the Constitution turns out to be unconstitutional. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=520.0400000000001s)]
*  Like you wouldn't have thought. But that's where you know, but that's where we are. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=524.84s)]
*  And so the key is here is that they this is a memo to a part of this independent agency saying, hey, we're in charge. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  And this is why. So they've sort of hinted at this in some court filings, but they haven't said it yet. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=535.44s)]
*  So it's very this was kind of a much you'd say it was a secret email. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=543.52s)]
*  It's not a public email. We obtained access to it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=546.64s)]
*  It's going to be a question. Are they going to bring that into court? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=551.16s)]
*  Because I think even like Sam Alito or Clarence, Tom is going to look at that like, oh, I don't know, man. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=554.04s)]
*  That's that's that's that's a steep hill. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=560.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can get there. So we will see. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=562.04s)]
*  We will see. Be sure to follow Josh's great work and all the people that work from a talking points member, a member, which I am. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=564.48s)]
*  I highly recommend. Thanks, Josh. Thanks much. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSrZeOdgKU&t=571.76s)]
