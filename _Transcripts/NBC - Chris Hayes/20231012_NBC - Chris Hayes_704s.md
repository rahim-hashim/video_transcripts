# ‘This is not complicated, America’: Sen. Booker condemns 'Hitler-like' Hamas
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q)
*  Senator Cory Booker is a Democrat of New Jersey who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Last Saturday, he was in Israel when the Hamas attacks began. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=4.68s)]
*  This is his first interview since returning to the United States. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=8.24s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=10.44s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=11.44s)]
*  Good to be here with you in person again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=12.44s)]
*  Well, let me just start because you just learned, as I did, that Steve Scalise has withdrawn, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=14.24s)]
*  which, you know, it's not your house, but it's all of ours in the sense that it's the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=18.48s)]
*  United States House of Representatives. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=23.72s)]
*  To the point that Michael McCall, the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, made, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=25.88s)]
*  it also means that certain things can't be done over there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=29.38s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=31.74s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=33.5s)]
*  We are in crisis right now in the country, and we have important issues we should be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=34.5s)]
*  dealing with. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=37.9s)]
*  Resolutely supporting the effort in Ukraine, resolutely standing with Israel, helping to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=39.46s)]
*  aid in their defense and the protection of citizens and the evacuation of Americans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=45.94s)]
*  from Gaza to Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=50.82s)]
*  There are many important issues, not to mention funding the government. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=53.06s)]
*  So to have this level of dysfunction amongst the House of Republicans, and especially a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=57.18s)]
*  number of small group of right-wing folks who are undermining the functioning of government, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=62.3s)]
*  this is very problematic at a terrible time going on in our world right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=68.18s)]
*  You were in Israel on that Saturday, on Simchat Torah, when the Hamas massacre happened in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=73.22s)]
*  the South. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=79.42s)]
*  You were also in the region, I believe, after that, if not mistaken. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=81.1s)]
*  What is your takeaway back here, having been in the region at this moment of such awful [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=85.98s)]
*  crisis? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=90.02s)]
*  Look, I was going there on a mission because there is this pathway to peace that had opened [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=91.02s)]
*  up through the Abraham Accords. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=96.22s)]
*  I went there to meet with Palestinian leaders, Israeli leaders, and then to continue in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=98.34s)]
*  region with people who really believe, as MBS said in an interview on Fox, that there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=101.78s)]
*  is a credible pathway towards a grand bargain of regional peace with the Palestinian principle, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  a pillar, being very key about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=112.66s)]
*  Palestinian leaders, for the first time, were having conversations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=115.42s)]
*  In fact, Saudis, for the first time, came, since 1967, came to the West Bank to meet [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=117.5s)]
*  with Palestinian leaders on a pathway to peace. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=122.78s)]
*  And so here you have this terrorist organization whose very charter doesn't say for the destruction [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=125.3s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=131.58s)]
*  The very charter is Hitler-esque. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=132.58s)]
*  They want to destroy Jews, launching missiles. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=133.58s)]
*  And so for me, before this, I got there early because it's a very important holiday for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  me personally. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=142.86s)]
*  I've been there about 30 years since, as a Christian, I've been studying Torah and really [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=144.3s)]
*  engaging in a faith that means so much to me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=151.86s)]
*  I danced with the Torah the night before these attacks, sat and had Shabbat dinner with friends, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=154.94000000000003s)]
*  two of them who've lost family members. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  One family members were slaughtered in the kibbutz. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=163.38000000000002s)]
*  I had a nephew who was called up to defend folks and was killed in defending lives, innocent [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=167.02s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  This is a ISIS-like terrorist organization who targeted civilians in the most heinous [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  staggering of ways. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=181.9s)]
*  And what's more tragic for the Palestinians, who Hamas has murdered, kidnapped Palestinians, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=183.98s)]
*  Hamas has brutalized its own people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=190.22s)]
*  And what is interesting about their pattern right now, known throughout everybody I talked [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=194.38000000000002s)]
*  about, talked with in the Middle East, from journalists to business people to members [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=198.62s)]
*  of government, they all know Hamas' mission is to stop peace. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  And at the very moment that a pathway to peace opened up, that you heard from the Saudis, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=208.78s)]
*  from the Emiratis, from folks in Bahrain who understood that we had an opportunity here [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  for a re-upping of the two-state solution. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=217.62s)]
*  Hamas, terrorists, ISIS-like, Hitler-like folks who hate Jews and want to kill them, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=221.06s)]
*  opened up one of the worst terrorist attacks over the last 50 years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=227.86s)]
*  In terms of that peace process, there was lots of word being sent that there was a move [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=233.02s)]
*  towards Saudi and Israeli normalization, which of course would be an enormous change. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=239.58s)]
*  One of the criticisms I've heard, and this is independent of what Hamas' motives are, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=244.82s)]
*  which I can't really define, and you can read their statements if you want to, is that it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  was an attempt to bypass essentially the peace with Palestinians, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=254.18s)]
*  This idea that you would lock in normalization without resolving the enormous problem of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=257.86s)]
*  two million people living in essentially a penal colony and the occupation of the West [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=262.42s)]
*  Bank. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=266.3s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=267.3s)]
*  Well, that's completely wrong. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=268.3s)]
*  I know that because I'm one of the founding members of the Abraham Accords. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=269.3s)]
*  I've been very involved in a lot of this diplomatic work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=272.5s)]
*  I should be on a plane in about a week with Republicans, a small group of us, Republicans, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=275.34s)]
*  Democrats, going to Saudi Arabia to continue these talks because we cannot let these terrorists, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=279.54s)]
*  this ISIS-like, Nazi-like people win. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=286.5s)]
*  We're going to continue these conversations. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=289.74s)]
*  Is this going to derail that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=291.14s)]
*  I stayed in the region. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=293.94s)]
*  I just came back today because I didn't want to let it derail it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=295.14s)]
*  Americans to Arabs in the region, everybody wants to continue this pathway and centered [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=300.02s)]
*  in it as the leader of Saudi Arabia said on Fox News, centered in this has to be a pathway [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  back to the two-state solution and a revocable pathway back to the two-state solution. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=312.18s)]
*  In my conversations with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans before this attack, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=317.06s)]
*  we all agreed, State Department agreed this had to be about peace. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=321.58s)]
*  The very moment when you hear Arab leaders openly discussing an opportunity for peace, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=326.5s)]
*  an organization founded to kill Jews who, after the Oslo Accords, 2014, when Arafat [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=333.82s)]
*  and Rabin get the Nobel Peace Prize and there's a pathway to peace, what does Hamas do right [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=340.7s)]
*  after that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=344.86s)]
*  They go after Israelis. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=345.86s)]
*  They bomb buses. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=348.1s)]
*  They target civilians and then use their own people as human shields as Israel exercises [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=349.1s)]
*  its right to self-defense, hoping that the sympathy that they could maybe bring about [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  by the people they are endangering could somehow undermine support for a peace process. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=361.18s)]
*  Well, we're seeing this again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's why the debate in America should not be a date. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=369.18s)]
*  We should have the crystal clarity to support Israel and to call out these Nazi ISIS-like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=371.62s)]
*  folks who are targeting civilians with an attempt not just to kill and murder Jews, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=378.86s)]
*  not just to kill and use Palestinians as human shields, not just to target, remember, there's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=384.94s)]
*  Nepalese, Argentinians, French, Americans that have all been killed or held hostage [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  through this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=396.14s)]
*  We have to continue the pathway towards peace and human rights for Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=397.38s)]
*  You talk about sort of human shields and attempting to sort of curry favor or public opinion. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=403.7s)]
*  Again, I think the moral responsibility for what happens in Gaza, I can't even begin to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=410.74s)]
*  debate about whose fault it will be. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=415.86s)]
*  All I know is that there are 6,000 bombs that have been dropped, according to Israeli Defense [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  Forces. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=421.70000000000005s)]
*  That's more than monthly amounts on Raqqa or Mosul during periods in which we were bombing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=423.18s)]
*  ISIS at highest levels of sorties that we ever did. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  What do you say to people who say there are millions of civilians there? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=432.5s)]
*  What are we doing as a U.S.? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, I've been in talks today about creating a humanitarian corridor. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=438.26000000000005s)]
*  There are Americans of Palestinian descent in Gaza right now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=443.70000000000005s)]
*  There are children and innocent suffering. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=447.70000000000005s)]
*  And so we're going to continue as Americans to do everything we can to create a humanitarian [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  corridor. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=454.1s)]
*  These are, again, terrorists target civilians. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=455.54s)]
*  Israel is a democracy and democracies are stronger when they abide by the rule of law. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=460.1s)]
*  President Biden has said that publicly, where you try to minimize casualties. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=464.74s)]
*  And that is something that we all can call on Israel as they exercise their right to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=469.22s)]
*  self-defense, to do everything possible to minimize civilian loss as these cowards and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=473.54s)]
*  terrorists are using their own Palestinian people as human shields. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=479.22s)]
*  It is awful. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=485.22s)]
*  And we need to do everything possible to help to minimize that damage. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=486.22s)]
*  But to me, there should be no confusion about this for Americans. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=489.62s)]
*  And I'll say this not just as a United States senator, not just as a patriot who would die [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=494.66s)]
*  for my own country, but I want to say this as a black man. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=498.18s)]
*  When you're black in America, you understand the vulnerability within your own country [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  you love. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=509.54s)]
*  I saw it as an adult on January 6th. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=511.42s)]
*  The people that stormed the Capitol talked to Capitol police or African Americans. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=515.38s)]
*  They had signs of hatred, Confederate flags, the vicious racist things they were saying [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=522.14s)]
*  to Capitol police officers. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=529.38s)]
*  But side by side, those symbols of hate towards black Americans were shirts like Camp Auschwitz [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=531.54s)]
*  shirts. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=537.1s)]
*  Hate has an indiscriminate infection. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=539.22s)]
*  This is why as an American, as a black American, I will always stand against hate and stand [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=546.56s)]
*  with the people who are targets of hate. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=554.52s)]
*  Just like the Nazis who didn't just destroy 6 million Jews, they destroyed gay people, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=559.1199999999999s)]
*  gypsies. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=564.64s)]
*  I will stand with people who are targets of hate. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  Hamas, like the Nazis, and like ISIS, are people who target with hate. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=569.4s)]
*  I stand with Jews. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  I stand with Muslims. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  I stand with gay folks. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=578.64s)]
*  I stand with people right now who all have a common cause to stand against Hamas because [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=580.44s)]
*  Hamas is an indiscriminately hateful people who do not want peace. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  They want to destroy others and stop us from having peace. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=592.08s)]
*  This is not complicated America. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  It is not complicated. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=598.5200000000001s)]
*  We all must denounce hate and those people who use hate to destroy. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=600.76s)]
*  That is Hamas. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=606.52s)]
*  And so I am worried right now. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm worried about rising anti-Semitism in the United States. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=611.88s)]
*  I led with three other senators, bipartisan, to call for more resources because hate is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=615.52s)]
*  indiscriminate in its efforts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  The same hate that killed blacks in a church in South Carolina, or the same people who [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=624.16s)]
*  were reeling the same hate that killed in a synagogue. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=629.48s)]
*  And so we all need to take an understanding. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=632.0s)]
*  Everyone has a responsibility to condemn the hatred of this ISIS Nazi like Hamas and do [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  everything we can to try to get us back to peace, to affirming of human rights for all [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=640.0s)]
*  people in that region and, again, the protection of this country. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=645.12s)]
*  And this country is, unfortunately, too often targets of hate. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=649.24s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=652.5200000000001s)]
*  I think, again, if you could wave a magic wand to get rid of Hamas, I think people would [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=654.24s)]
*  take that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=659.88s)]
*  And we said this off camera. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=660.88s)]
*  I want folks to know when I travel to these other countries, other Arabs, they all know [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=661.88s)]
*  what kind of organization Hamas is. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=666.24s)]
*  I was almost lectured to by leaders in other Arab countries just over the last few days [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=667.84s)]
*  about how horrific Hamas is, what the awful things they have done to Palestinians. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=674.28s)]
*  Arab countries know how dangerous and vicious this organization is. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=680.44s)]
*  I think we should all take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=684.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=689.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=694.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=699.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=702.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=703.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=704.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=705.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=706.24s)]
*  take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and take a step back and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpd8GGoHG2Q&t=707.24s)]
