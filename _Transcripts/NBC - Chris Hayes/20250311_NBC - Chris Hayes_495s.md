# 'So frightening': DOJ official fired over Mel Gibson gun rights request speaks out
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE)
*  On Friday, the Department of Justice pardon attorney, that's the senior government lawyer in charge of evaluating and processing petitions to be pardoned, was fired, hardly an inoneness. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=0.0s)]
*  At first glance, it looked like there was probably a story there, and sure enough, there was. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=10.5s)]
*  Here's the headline. DOJ official says she was fired after opposing the restoration of Mel Gibson's gun rights. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  The pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, said she was told, quote, Mel Gibson is a friend of the president, and that should be justification enough to restore his gun rights. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=22.599999999999998s)]
*  When she didn't go along with the recommendation, she was fired. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=31.2s)]
*  And joining me now is the former Department of Justice pardon attorney Liz Oyer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=35.48s)]
*  Ms. Oyer, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=39.4s)]
*  First, can I just ask you to for people that have no idea what a pardon attorney is, can you just explain what your job was? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=42.28s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So it is a little understood position. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=49.88s)]
*  The job of the pardon attorney is to make recommendations to the president about granting clemency to people who are deserving of second chances. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=53.24s)]
*  And I know that we hear about pardons in the news and they're usually the high profile ones and the controversial ones. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Those are not the cases that I work on as the pardon attorney. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  The job of the pardon attorney is to ensure that all of those Americans who don't have access to the White House through the front door still have the opportunity to be considered in the clemency process. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=71.84s)]
*  So that's my job, to make sure that those deserving Americans who don't have political access, don't have connections, aren't celebrities or wealthy, can still have access to the justice that clemency can provide. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=83.44s)]
*  And how long had you been doing that job? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=97.0s)]
*  I had had that job for nearly three years. It would have been three years in April. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=99.8s)]
*  Now, tell me about what happened last week. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=105.12s)]
*  When did the Mel Gibson issue first make its way to you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=108.32s)]
*  I was tasked a few weeks ago with joining a working group in the department that brought together multiple offices within the Department of Justice in order to launch a process to broadly begin restoring gun rights to Americans [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=113.52s)]
*  who had lost their rights to possess a firearm because of a criminal conviction. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=129.04s)]
*  This is a project that I understood was a priority for the attorney general. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=133.64s)]
*  And I was told that this project was going to be centered in the office of the pardon attorney, which was an entirely new workflow for us, not something that we had ever done before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=137.72s)]
*  And did you was it like just a bunch of people in a spreadsheet or was it like, hey, here's Mel Gibson? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=148.12s)]
*  So I was told that we were working toward establishing a process that all Americans who were prohibited from possessing a firearm would have access to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=155.76s)]
*  And the initial request of my office was that we identify a group of candidates who we thought would be suitable for the attorney general to grant this relief to in connection with making an announcement of the broader program. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=164.76s)]
*  So what I did when given that assignment is I looked to the pool of individuals who had applied for presidential pardons and who my office had vetted for consideration of a presidential pardon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=177.8s)]
*  We extensively vet people before recommending them to the president for a pardon because we know that one consequence of receiving a pardon is that you're able to legally purchase a firearm. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=190.12s)]
*  So when we vet someone for a pardon, we conduct a full background investigation of the level that would be required to gain a top secret security clearance. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=201.88s)]
*  Was Mel Gibson one of those people that you had identified? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=212.6s)]
*  He was not Mel Gibson has never applied for any type of relief through my office. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  But we were able to identify ninety five ordinary Americans who had applied for pardons, who had been waiting years to be considered for that relief and to have been extensively vetted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=222.64s)]
*  All of these folks had in common a number of things, including that their underlying crimes of conviction were nonviolent offenses. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=234.88s)]
*  They were minor offenses. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=242.48s)]
*  They were offenses that happened many, many years ago in all cases, 20 plus years ago. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  And these are all individuals who had demonstrated by interviews with neighbors and employers and family members and others who know them that they have been outstanding citizens since the time of their conviction. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=249.84s)]
*  Mel Gibson was not among those individuals who we identified. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=261.84s)]
*  So where does Mel, when does, how does Mel Gibson enter the workflow? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=265.68s)]
*  So what happened was I was asked to put together a memo for the attorney general, summarizing the cases of nine of the ninety five individuals that my colleagues and I had identified. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=270.0s)]
*  They had whittled that ninety five down to nine and they asked me to write a memo to the attorney general recommending that these would be suitable candidates for her to grant this relief of restoring their firearm rights. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  And I was comfortable doing that with those cases because I had a great deal of information about those nine people and had already recommended that they were suitable candidates for a presidential pardon. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  So Mel Gibson did not enter the equation until after I sent the initial draft of my memo to some officials within the office of the deputy attorney general. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  They received my memo and they sent it back to me with the direction, please add Mel Gibson to this recommendation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  I see. And their justification for that was what? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=321.8s)]
*  Well, there was no justification specifically provided, but they did attach a letter that had been sent by Mel Gibson's personal attorney to the then acting attorney general and acting deputy attorney general in which Mel Gibson's attorney requested that he received this relief from the attorney general. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  Mel Gibson's attorney laid out that Mr. Gibson had a previous conviction for domestic violence in 2011 and that he had attempted to purchase a firearm in 2023 and that he was denied because of his criminal background. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  And the attorney stated that Mr. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=360.23999999999995s)]
*  Gibson is a high profile actor who's made lots of famous movies and that he has a relationship with the president and asked that he be granted that relief. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=362.11999999999995s)]
*  Todd Blanch, who is the number two, I guess now at Department of Justice, has this to say about your account here, saying that former employees who violate their ethical duties by making false accusations on press tours will not be tolerated. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=372.72s)]
*  I don't know what that means. This former employee's version events is false. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=385.36s)]
*  Her decisions to voice this erroneous accusation about her dismissals in direct violation of her ethical duties as an attorney is a shameful distraction from our critical mission to prosecute violent crime, enforce our nation's immigration laws and make us America safe again. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=388.8s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=402.0s)]
*  Well, Chris, the reason that I'm here talking about this tonight is because what's going on inside the Department of Justice in terms of silencing dissent is so frightening that I felt like I needed to share this story after I was fired. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=403.4s)]
*  And frankly, I think Mr. Blanch's statement really just proves my point. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=417.44s)]
*  My ethical duty as a Department of Justice employee and now a former one is to the laws of the United States and the people that I was entrusted to serve. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=421.84s)]
*  It is not to the bullies who are currently running the Department of Justice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=431.68s)]
*  We take an oath of office as Department of Justice employees and that oath says nothing about loyalty to the political administration or to the political leadership of the department. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=436.28s)]
*  And frankly, I think that the position that Mr. Blanch is taking in his statement really just proves how terrified we should be about the current situation at the Department of Justice. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=446.96s)]
*  Liz Oyer, former pardon attorney at the Department of Justice, fired by the attorney general, I guess, there for refusing to give Mel Gibson a pardon. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=460.28s)]
*  Sign off on one. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=470.24s)]
*  Ms. Oyer, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=471.88s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnqvG95BOqE&t=473.64s)]
