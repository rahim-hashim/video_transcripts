# Slow wheels of justice aiding Trump 'run-out-the-clock' legal plan
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. So Donald Trump's closing arguments to voters in New Hampshire this past weekend into Election Day on Tuesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=0.0s)]
*  The issue he's most focused on now as the man on the glide path to be the Republican nominee and run for president is that he can't be prosecuted for crimes he committed when he was president. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  That's his that's his North Star. It's now a central platform plan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=18.64s)]
*  And 16 days ago, Donald Trump's lawyers argued that ex presidents, all ex presidents, but particularly Donald Trump, are immune from prosecution and that therefore Trump has total immunity and cannot be brought to justice for his blatant efforts to steal the 2020 election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=23.84s)]
*  And now that was two weeks ago. Over two weeks later, we're still waiting for the judge's decision as Trump racks up delegates at the primary and the election looms closer every day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=40.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, many people are understandably anxious to find out if Donald Trump actually can be held legally accountable for an effort to overthrow America's constitutional republic, culminating in January 6th. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=51.12s)]
*  The problem for everyone wants to see Trump actually face a trial and justice and everyone who would like this all to just be over is that the justice system is slow. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=65.16s)]
*  Justice system doesn't work on anyone else's timeline, not a campaign timeline and certainly not a cable news timeline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=74.02s)]
*  We just saw an example of this today with former Trump adviser Peter Navarro. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Remember that guy? He got sentenced today to four months in prison. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=84.24s)]
*  Navarro, along with Steve Bannon, orchestrated one of Trump's coup plots intended to block the certification of electoral votes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=88.2s)]
*  And he didn't try to hide it. In fact, he even described the very plot in great detail to Ari Melbourne. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=96.36s)]
*  This plan we had called the Green Bay sweep clearly between constitutional and legal lines to basically have only legal votes counted in the election. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=102.12s)]
*  And the plan was simply this. We had over 100 congressmen and senators on Capitol ready to implement the sweep. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=114.48s)]
*  The sweep was simply that we were going to challenge the results of the election in the six battleground states. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to try a coup. Now, unsurprisingly, Peter Navarro attracted the attention of the January 6th committee, which issued him a subpoena that Navarro ignored. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=133.04s)]
*  And in September, he was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress for ignoring those subpoenas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=142.76s)]
*  They weren't long trials. He had no defense. He clearly had ignored them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=147.88s)]
*  And I have to say, I don't feel any particular joy at all about a 74 year old man going to prison for four months. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=151.52s)]
*  But Peter Navarro sentencing is welcome news in the sense it is absolutely necessary for there to be some measure of legal accountability for the people who committed gross crimes against our democracy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  But once again, the problem is the timing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=167.44s)]
*  Navarro's sentence will not deter anyone else from defying a subpoena from the January 6th committee because the committee no longer exists. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=171.04s)]
*  It was disbanded over a year ago. I mean, he may not even serve his time for quite a while, if at all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=179.2s)]
*  He will almost certainly appeal his conviction, putting the sentence on hold. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  His co-conspirator Steve Bannon is still walking free, released on his own recognizance pending his appeal out there with three shirts and a podcast a year after his sentencing on the very same charges. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  We've got two sayings about the justice system. They're cliches, but but, you know, people use it for a reason. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=201.56s)]
*  And I think they get at the heart of this whole conflict. Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  One is justice delayed is justice denied. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  If the legal system moves too slowly, then it can't deliver justice at all. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=212.48s)]
*  And the other indirect tension with that idea is the wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=216.76s)]
*  So, yes, the legal system moves slowly, but it gets the right result and it has to grind slowly to grind fine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=223.64s)]
*  Now, of course, we live in the era of Donald Trump, whose strategy at every turn is to test the law, to try to get away with as much as possible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=230.72s)]
*  And one of the ways he does that is to delay, delay, delay long enough for issues to become moot or for him to return to the White House or for litigants to just give up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=237.2s)]
*  And we've seen that over and over. The justice system often moves slowly enough that he can't outrun it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=246.56s)]
*  And delaying justice, getting those wheels to turn as slowly as possible for him has really worked. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  From the very beginning. Here's an example of Donald Trump's term as president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=259.8s)]
*  It was clear he had conflicts of interest through his businesses that really looked like they violated the foreign emoluments clause of the United States Constitution. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=263.56s)]
*  Multiple groups filed suit and those cases turned so slowly through the system, they were eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court days after Trump left office because they were moot. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=273.52s)]
*  And there was Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance's effort to obtain Trump's tax returns. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=285.32s)]
*  After an 18 month legal battle, Trump finally turned over those documents again after he was out of the White House. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=289.44s)]
*  You may also remember Trump White House counsel, Don McGahn, who, like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, refused to comply with a congressional subpoena about Trump's attempts to interfere in the Mueller investigation to obstruct justice. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=297.04s)]
*  It took two years before McGahn was finally forced to testify long after Trump was out of the White House and back in Mar-a-Lago and the whole chapter had closed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=310.16s)]
*  Oh, good. OK, well, yeah, we won. We get Don McGahn's testimony. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=319.8s)]
*  And that, of course, brings us to the most high stakes case of all, the four criminal cases against Donald Trump, totaling 91 felony counts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  The speed at which these cases move is obviously absolutely critical. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  This is a zero sum game. This is a finite thing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=337.48s)]
*  There are 284 days left until the election. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=340.8s)]
*  Every single day, Trump and his lawyers are able to delay the proceedings to push back a trial is a victory for the ex-president. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=344.56s)]
*  Now, to her credit, Judge Tanya Chukkin overseeing the federal case about Trump's attempted coup has been moving quite efficiently. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=351.76s)]
*  She set a trial date for March 4th. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=358.04s)]
*  But the case is on hold while we await the appeals court decision on Trump's immunity argument. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=360.76s)]
*  It's also clear the slow pace of Trump's cases are already helping him politically, as the Wall Street Journal explains, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=366.88s)]
*  the former president is proving less vulnerable on a legal front than many of his critics predicted. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump has raised money on his legal battle, seeing his support grow as he depicts himself as a victim of partisan prosecutors [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=378.08s)]
*  marshaling a crooked justice system to thwart his bid for a second term in the White House. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, I want to be very crystal clear here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=389.48s)]
*  It is wholly improper and illegitimate for the justice system to hurry up for the purpose of hurting Donald Trump politically. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=392.16s)]
*  That's not what we want and not what I'm saying. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  But what is a legitimate argument and an important one, and it's one that both Judge Chukkin and special counsel Jack Smith have made, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  is that there is a public interest to bring Donald Trump to trial swiftly, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=410.68s)]
*  Trying the ex-president would definitively establish whether or not he did what he is accused of. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=415.76s)]
*  And that information, that is information that voters deserve to have. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=421.48s)]
*  To be clear, an acquittal as much as a conviction, don't you think? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=426.0s)]
*  Right? Don't you think if he's acquitted, not guilty, voters should know that too? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=429.56s)]
*  That's information everyone should have before they decide if they want to send him back to the White House. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=434.44s)]
*  Now, based on what we've seen from Republican primary voters so far, I don't know if it would make much difference in the outcome to them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=440.6s)]
*  But the question is, will that key information, is the man guilty or not of attempting to subvert the Constitution, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=449.04s)]
*  that key information and the ability to make an informed choice with it, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=456.64s)]
*  will that be taken away from the 150 million Americans who are going to vote in November? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKBYVsYJS4&t=460.72s)]
