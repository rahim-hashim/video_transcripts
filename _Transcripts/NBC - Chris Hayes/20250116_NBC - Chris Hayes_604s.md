# 'Unelected tech bros’ are 'nightmare scenario' for Founding Fathers, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. In 1961, outgoing Republican President Dwight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=0.0s)]
*  Eisenhower delivered his farewell address to the nation as all presidents do, but as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=5.24s)]
*  a former World War II general and the outgoing commander in chief, his included quite a prescient [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=10.28s)]
*  warning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=16.12s)]
*  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=17.12s)]
*  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=25.12s)]
*  disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=31.6s)]
*  of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic process. We should take nothing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=38.6s)]
*  for granted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=44.24s)]
*  I think it's fair to say history has since vindicated Eisenhower. But at the time, this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=45.24s)]
*  warning shocked people. The so-called military industrial complex spent the following six [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  days consolidating power and influence in Washington to an extent that is, I think, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=54.62s)]
*  genuinely damaging both to our democracy and our foreign policy. Last night, President [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=59.58s)]
*  Joe Biden delivered a farewell address of his own and in an explicit nod to Eisenhower, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  offered a scorching warning about the new concentration of power we are seeing unfold [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=69.3s)]
*  before our eyes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=74.02s)]
*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=76.74s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=82.9s)]
*  shot for everyone to get ahead. I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=88.9s)]
*  industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=95.34s)]
*  I've got to say, it was generally wild to hear Joe Biden describe an oligarchy from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=99.98s)]
*  the Oval Office. It's a word that Bernie Sanders has been using for decades. It's the type [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=106.98s)]
*  of thing you usually hear from the mouths of folks, I would say, further to the left [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  than Joe Biden. And in short, it just means rule by a very, very small group of very, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  very wealthy folks. As journalist Brian Stelzer notes, searches for the term spike last night. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  The Associated Press even published an explainer of what exactly oligarchy is. And it's just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  not a word you hear applied very often in this country, at least not by the nation's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=131.22s)]
*  most powerful politicians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  I think Americans, when they do think about oligarchs, tend to think about what has emerged [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=140.14s)]
*  in the post-Soviet states like Russia, where leaders are surrounded by a handful of obscenely [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  wealthy men who effectively control entire industries, act with total impunity, with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=149.72s)]
*  the explicit or implicit permission of the actual government. These kinds of governments, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=154.82s)]
*  basically without exception, make lives miserable for their citizens because they destroy the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=159.82s)]
*  mechanisms of democratic feedback that allow for flourishing nations. They concentrate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=165.02s)]
*  power, which in turn leads to abuses of power, as President Biden warned last night. It's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=171.22s)]
*  that very concentration of power, in fact, that many of the most influential framers [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  of our constitution most feared. In Federalist 47, James Madison warned, the accumulation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=182.06s)]
*  of all powers in the same hands, whether of one, of fewer, many may justly be pronounced [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  the very definition of tyranny. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=194.36s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump very clearly, explicitly, constantly says this, wants to concentrate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  all the power around him. And his billionaire tech bro buddies appear to be down with this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=202.56s)]
*  plan as long as they get to be in the inner circle. I think they want to be American oligarchs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=208.24s)]
*  This week, we got word that Apple CEO Tim Cook will join the ranks of the billionaires [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=217.12s)]
*  At Trump's inauguration, this isn't just like, oh, it's great. Treats for peaceful transfer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=221.16s)]
*  Like there, show it up. When you show up to inauguration, like, yeah, that's my dude. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=224.76s)]
*  OK, they're going to be he's going to be there along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=227.96s)]
*  met as Mark Zuckerberg and open AI Sam Altman, among others. Elon Musk naturally will be [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=231.24s)]
*  at the inauguration as well. He won't be getting sworn in, but he is basically already operating [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=236.88s)]
*  as Trump's co-president with his own independent authority. And this is not like some meme. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=242.24s)]
*  I mean, he's calling the shots with congressional budget negotiators. He'll he'll be working [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=247.84s)]
*  within the White House complex. Apparently, he's already running off the books prisoner [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=251.68s)]
*  swap negotiations with Iran. To be clear, in my humble view, a handful of unelected [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=255.72s)]
*  tech billionaires should not be running the country just because they're giving lots of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=263.76s)]
*  money to Donald Trump and fawning over him. And all this might seem abstract now, like [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  who really cares of lots of rich people who influence American policy? True. Lots of rich [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=273.8s)]
*  donors. True. But there are many things these men and they are all men want from this government. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=277.92s)]
*  The process of governing of democratic governance is about managing the conflict endemic to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=286.6s)]
*  human affairs. And in managing that conflict, it is about prioritizing competing interests [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=293.48s)]
*  between different people, different groups of people, different factions. And when it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=299.72s)]
*  comes down to a scenario where there is a competing interest between what's good for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk and what's good for you, who do you think [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  is going to win that fight? Today, in an exclusive interview with Lawrence O'Donnell, President [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Biden reiterated how fearful he is for the future of American democracy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=322.12s)]
*  When you got up from that desk last night, that was really the final big public moment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=328.28s)]
*  in a 50 year political career. Yeah, that's how long it was. You've served in government [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=336.44s)]
*  longer than any person who's ever served in this job. What did that feel like at the end [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=345.08s)]
*  of that speech? We were pushed out of the room as people were surrounding you, hugging [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=352.84s)]
*  you and as that emotion was filling the room. But was there a sense of the release of a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  burden getting up from that desk? No, but there was a sense of serious concern. You [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=365.5s)]
*  I really am concerned about how fragile democracy is. That sounds corny, but I mean, I really [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=376.88s)]
*  am concerned because you've heard me say it a hundred times. I really think we're at an [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=390.44s)]
*  inflection point in history here. We're unrelated to any particular leader. Things are going [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=395.76s)]
*  to change drastically. You can catch the rest of the interview on the last word tonight [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=401.8s)]
*  at 10 p.m. Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. He's the ranking member of the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  Judiciary Committee and he joins me now. They didn't have tech billionaires in the Founders [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=411.08s)]
*  Day, but they had their own versions. And Madison is really pretty clear on this. This [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=416.64s)]
*  is kind of a nightmare scenario. Concentrated power in the hands of a few, without the sort [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=422.72s)]
*  of checks and balances, without particularly the primacy of Congress. The vision here is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=430.12s)]
*  almost the opposite, I think it's fair to say, of what the founders were thinking about. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=435.92s)]
*  Well, Madison, of course, was writing about the separation of powers and the powers and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=439.72s)]
*  how you didn't want all political power to be channeled either in the legislative branch, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=445.52s)]
*  the lawmaking or the executive or the judicial. Much less did the founders want all of the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=450.36s)]
*  power to reside somewhere else and have a huge conglomerate monopoly economic force [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=455.6s)]
*  control the whole government, all three branches of government. And so that's why, you know, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  Jefferson wanted anti-monopoly provision in the Constitution. But the whole anti-monopoly, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=468.04s)]
*  anti-trust politics of our history has been a dominant strain of pro-democratic thought. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=473.92s)]
*  There was something else that happened today that relates to what's happening in Congress. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=483.12s)]
*  Again, the theme here of consolidation of power. Mike Turner, chair of the House Intelligence [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=486.52s)]
*  Committee, right? This is a guy who's a rock-ribbed Republican. He basically got fired by the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=491.44s)]
*  president. He was replaced as the chairman. I think he was kicked off the committee. He's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=497.44s)]
*  going to be replaced by Mike Johnson. And when asked about it, he said it came from [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=503.12s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. It seems pretty clear that Trump fired him. I've never quite heard of something [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=506.76s)]
*  like this. Honestly. I mean, usually committee fiefdoms are so powerful and such a sort of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=510.92s)]
*  enduring source of congressional Article One independence. I'm pretty struck by this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=517.16s)]
*  Well, none of the autocrats want him. The autocrats in Mar-a-Lago don't want him. The [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  autocrats in Moscow don't want him. Look, he's been pro-Ukraine. He's voted with the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  Democrats for aid to Ukraine. He was a great mayor of Dayton who had a real bipartisan history [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=536.92s)]
*  and base of support. And after the terrible gun violence that took place in Dayton, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=544.92s)]
*  he came out for an assault weapon ban. He's someone who's extremely popular with Democrats. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=550.36s)]
*  And who knows what's going to happen at this point. But that's a terrible affront and indignity to a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=556.76s)]
*  guy who had at least one more term as chair of the Intelligence Committee. And to have the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=564.36s)]
*  Republican Party just turn their backs on him like that and disown him is a major rupture in the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=569.4s)]
*  political fabric of the House of Representatives. It'll be very interesting to see what happens now [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  because he has a lot of friends on the Democratic side of the aisle. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFXiz0jlND8&t=580.6s)]
