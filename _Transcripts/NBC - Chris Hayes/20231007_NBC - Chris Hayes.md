# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Oct. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo)
*  When last we left the House Republican caucus, they were flirting openly with the idea of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=0.0s)]
*  anointing Donald Trump as their speaker, as Speaker of the House for the entire United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=6.16s)]
*  This is the man, of course, who's sick to mob on that same Capitol building [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  in an attempt to violently topple the duly elected government, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=14.96s)]
*  a man who has since been indicted on 91 criminal counts, including four of those events, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=18.8s)]
*  across four jurisdictions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=23.6s)]
*  They were actively talking about choosing him to lead the United States House of Representatives, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=26.0s)]
*  to make him second in line to the presidency. That is until about 930 last night, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=31.6s)]
*  when Republican Congressman Troy Nels of Texas announced that he, quote, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=36.32s)]
*  just had a great conversation with President Trump about the Speaker's race, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=39.84s)]
*  and he is endorsing Jim Jordan, the Congressman from Ohio. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  The ex-president himself followed it up with a middle of the night post, confirming he does [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=47.6s)]
*  indeed think that Jordan will be a great Speaker of the House and has his complete and total [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=51.12s)]
*  endorsement. God, that's a long post. Now, to a very small degree, tiny sliver, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=55.68s)]
*  I'll take what I could get these days. This is something of a relief, honestly, because I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  think Donald Trump as Speaker of the House would be an awful and dangerous situation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=65.92s)]
*  But the potential speakership of Jim Jordan, far-right member of the House Freedom Caucus, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=70.4s)]
*  a loyal Trump ally, solves absolutely nothing. And in fact, it represents everything that is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=75.12s)]
*  wrong with the Republican Party. I mean, Jim Jordan is the member of Congress who was arguably [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=82.0s)]
*  most involved in Donald Trump's coup. Earlier this week, January 6th committee Vice Chairwoman Liz [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=87.84s)]
*  Cheney laid this out for us again in a speech. Jim Jordan knew more [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=94.0s)]
*  about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6th than any other member of the House of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=103.04s)]
*  Representatives. Jim Jordan was involved, was part of the conspiracy in which Donald Trump was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=109.76s)]
*  engaged as he attempted to overturn the election. And if the Republicans decide that Jim Jordan [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=118.56s)]
*  should be the Speaker of the House, there will, and I, by the way, I don't think that's going to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=127.6s)]
*  happen. I think he'll lose. But if they were to decide that, there would no longer be any [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=133.6s)]
*  possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=140.16s)]
*  Constitution. Remember, Liz Cheney and the January 6th committee subpoenaed Jim Jordan. They wanted [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=147.44s)]
*  to know more about what he did know, what he did in the run-up to January 6th, and he just [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  flat-out ignored it. So he never got the truth from a man who they believed to be a key witness [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=158.4s)]
*  in the investigation, as Vice Chair Cheney said at the time. I think that Congressman Jordan may [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=163.68s)]
*  well be a material witness. He's somebody who was involved in a number of meetings in the lead-up [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=170.88s)]
*  to what happened on January 6th, involved in planning for January 6th, certainly for the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=177.28s)]
*  objections that day, as he said publicly. So he may well be a material witness. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=183.2s)]
*  Jim Jordan is also one of the Republican lawmakers who returned to the House chamber [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=189.2s)]
*  after they were all escorted out, right, into safe spaces, literally, and after the violent sacking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=193.76s)]
*  of the Capitol, when they came back in, who then voted in favor of Donald Trump's coup. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=201.2s)]
*  And just five days later, Trump rewarded his loyal foot soldier with the Medal of Freedom. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=206.88s)]
*  So Jim Jordan is one of the most MAGA-devoted members of the caucus, the same group of people [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=213.2s)]
*  that produced the very situation we are in now with a destructive, ungovernable Republican [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=218.56s)]
*  majority in the House. In the words of former Speaker John Boehner, he is a political terrorist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  You call some of these members political terrorists. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=230.32s)]
*  Oh yeah, Jim Jordan especially, my colleague from Ohio. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=236.72s)]
*  never building anything, never putting anything together. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=243.52s)]
*  One of the ways Jim Jordan tears things apart is by fanning the flames of discord on Fox News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=247.52s)]
*  Jordan has made no less than, and this is an accurate number as far as we can tell, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=253.28s)]
*  565 appearances on Fox in a little over six years. And that's just on weekdays, okay? He might as [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=257.44s)]
*  well have his own weekly program. In fact, Jordan has made more appearances on Fox than any other [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=264.0s)]
*  sitting member of Congress since media matters began counting back in 2017. By comparison, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=268.8s)]
*  his main competitor for speaker, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, has been on less than 300 times. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=274.56s)]
*  All of which is to say, a Jim Jordan speakership would be a near worst-case scenario. He is a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=280.24s)]
*  destructive force, a political terrorist, in the words of a colleague, John Boehner, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=287.44s)]
*  a guy who is willing to destroy American democracy for Donald Trump. Anyone who endorses [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=294.24s)]
*  Jordan and any member who votes for him is affirmatively voting for a coup plotter, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=298.64s)]
*  an election denier, and a foe of American democracy. And that is especially true [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=303.12s)]
*  for the 18 House Republicans representing districts that were carried by Joe Biden. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=308.88s)]
*  People like David Schweikart in Arizona, Mike Garcia and Young Kim in California, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=313.76s)]
*  Nicola Lota, George Santos. Remember that guy? Mike Lawler, Mark Molinara, all in New York. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=319.28s)]
*  All those people you see up on their screen, are they going to vote for Jim Jordan? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=325.36s)]
*  A vote for Jordan from any of them, from any Republican, but especially from these [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=330.56s)]
*  vulnerable members, is a vote for a MAGA extremist. It is a proxy vote for Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=335.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's anointed him. Heck, it's a vote for Donald Trump and Matt Gaetz, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=340.64s)]
*  who have both endorsed him. It's not clear if the Republican Party understands the problem they have. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  In a crystal clear example of their total oblivion, earlier today, this is too good, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  I can't believe this, we learned that candidates for speaker were going to have a debate on Fox [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=356.0s)]
*  News on television. Now, keep in mind, Fox and the right-wing media ecosystem is largely [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=361.52s)]
*  responsible for the current state of the Republican Party. They have produced a movement so [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=369.84s)]
*  obsessively focused on trolling and attention that it has no governing vision. It's essentially a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=375.84s)]
*  media production. A Fox News debate for speaker was kind of a perfect idea in that respect, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  but a terrible idea on the merits. Such a terrible idea, it sparked an immediate backlash, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=388.64s)]
*  even from within the House Republican caucus. One moderate House Republican told Axios, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  it's the height of idiocy. A few hours later, both Jim Jordan and Skeves DeLis backed out. Fox had [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=399.12s)]
*  to delete the press release from their website. But debate or no debate, the Republican caucus [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=404.88s)]
*  still has all of the same problems they had when they deposed Kevin McCarthy. The same problems [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=409.12s)]
*  they had when they elected Kevin McCarthy. The hard right, burn it all down base, is not going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=415.52s)]
*  anywhere. The party is still run by Donald Trump, a uniquely malevolent, dangerous force [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=421.76s)]
*  in American politics who wants to end the constitutional Republican as we know it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=428.4s)]
*  None of that has been solved. None of it will be solved by Speaker Jordan or Speaker Skelesse, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  if either of them can get enough votes to win the gavel. Republicans are going to have to elect [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=438.56s)]
*  someone to run one of the two houses of the United States Congress and keep the government [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  functioning. We'll just have to wait and see because frankly, I have no idea what happens next. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=448.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland serves with Jim Jordan on the House Oversight [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=454.96s)]
*  Committee, where he's the ranking member, and he joins me now. Jim Jordan, right temperament [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=458.56s)]
*  to be Speaker of the House, Congressman? Well, Jim Jordan is polemical and pugilistic [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=463.76s)]
*  and combative in committee. We shouldn't kid ourselves because he's not without [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=472.88s)]
*  talent and a certain kind of rhetorical flair. He's got a tragic flaw, which is that because of his [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=481.04s)]
*  natural authoritarianism, he loves to cover up and apologize for men in power who abuse their power [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  to vicious ends. And he did that with the sexual abuser on the wrestling team back in Ohio. And, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=498.56s)]
*  of course, he has devoted his career recently to covering up all of the constitutional crimes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=507.2s)]
*  and offenses and outrages committed by Donald Trump. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=513.44s)]
*  And I don't quite know what that psychological characteristic is that drives him to do that, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=517.52s)]
*  but he has a real penchant for defending people who take power and abuse it, and it's not a good [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=523.28s)]
*  sign. He is not any kind of real budget deficit hawk. He gladly votes for continuing resolutions. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=529.04s)]
*  And so he really is a right-wing authoritarian culture warrior who mirrors Donald Trump [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=539.6s)]
*  in his basic temperament and political commitments. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=547.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the fact that Trump, he's been endorsed by Trump and Gates now, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=551.76s)]
*  we got some new reporting today that back at the original election of Speaker, the one that went [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=556.16s)]
*  through 15 ballots for Kevin Carthy, that Trump was toying the idea of running for it himself, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  that he saw the power of television, a close Trump advisor told me. He saw how galvanizing it was, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=567.52s)]
*  how mesmerizing it was. Everybody was watching it, right? That's when Trump realizes it's the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  biggest reality show in America. He could sit up there like Celebrity Apprentice. It'd be the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=576.88s)]
*  Apprentice with him with a big ass gavel. This to me sort of captures the problem and is not [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=580.32s)]
*  unrelated to Jim Jordan's appearances on Fox and not unrelated to the motion to dismiss by Matt [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Gates and not unrelated to the entire democratic crisis we find ourselves in, which is the incentives [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=590.88s)]
*  for these folks seem wildly misaligned. Well, yeah. I mean, it's all about ego for the ones [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=597.36s)]
*  who get into office. There's no political program. There's no mission for the country. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=606.8s)]
*  Trump, according to one Republican who spoke to me about it off the record, was actually deeply [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=610.56s)]
*  interested in running for Speaker, but he was blocked both by Republican Party rules, which say [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=616.56s)]
*  that you can't run if you are currently under indictment for a felony that would land you in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  jail for two years or more, which is a nice touch for their rules. I like that. But he's also barred, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  of course, by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says if you've sworn an [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=634.64s)]
*  oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and violated it by engaging in insurrection or rebellion, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  you shall never be allowed the whole federal or state office again. And the speakership, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=644.48s)]
*  although it's not confined to members of Congress, is nonetheless a federal office. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=649.28s)]
*  And I think you would be barred from it. But the problem is exactly what you were saying, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=652.88s)]
*  which is that, look, what do you have in Congress today? We've got 212 Democrats who are unified, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  focused, and we've got a program for the country. Then you've got an extreme mega-wing, which [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  Matt Gaetz exemplifies, which is literally taking orders on the phone from Donald Trump, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=671.76s)]
*  like shut down the government, to shut down my prosecutions. Then you've got around 185 or 190 [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  right-wing Republicans, many of whom call themselves mega, but they basically are willing to do [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=684.88s)]
*  whatever the mega terrorist wing, as you put it, is demanding. And so they're willing to go with it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=691.52s)]
*  But there's still about a dozen moderate, critical-thinking Republicans left. And those [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  are the people that we're desperately trying to reach out to, to say, can you support Hakeem [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=703.28s)]
*  Jeffries, who is a principled, effective, efficient leader for speaker? And we will [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=709.2s)]
*  put the House and the country back on a firm course. And if they can't do that, I don't know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=714.96s)]
*  Maybe we could talk about Liz Cheney. We could talk about some other people who would be [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=720.0s)]
*  Republicans if they can't bring themselves to vote for a Democrat. But we know there are around [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=724.08s)]
*  a dozen Republicans who are appalled by the authoritarian direction of their caucus. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=728.8s)]
*  Yeah. And again, I think to me, the sort of disqualifying vote, although Kevin McCarthy [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=735.2s)]
*  took the same vote as Steve Solis, if I'm not mistaken, he did, is that vote on January 6. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=741.92s)]
*  I mean, to be in that chamber, to watch what happened, to watch what the president did, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=748.8s)]
*  and everyone was there. You guys were all there, right? The cops getting their heads bashed in, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  the president painting a target on his vice president, not sending the grout home. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=758.24s)]
*  To be taken to safety and then come back into that building that had been so desecrated and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=764.24s)]
*  rampaged and vote for the coup, as a majority of those members did, I mean, that to me is a—that's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=768.48s)]
*  a disqualifying vote to be speaker of the House. Now, we already passed that because of Kevin McCarthy. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=773.84s)]
*  But— Well, that's what was so astounding about McCarthy. He literally placed a call to Donald [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump from his office, which was being besieged and ransacked, begging him to call off the mob. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=785.12s)]
*  And everybody knows Trump's response was, well, maybe they just care a little bit more about a [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=791.52s)]
*  fair election than you do, Kevin. And yet even though he knew to call Donald Trump, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=795.36s)]
*  who was the mastermind of the whole thing, the call-off, he could not bring himself to join [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=800.4s)]
*  Liz Cheney, who was the number three person in the Republican hierarchy to vote to impeach [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=804.8s)]
*  Donald Trump, even though he said on the floor that Trump was responsible. And then, of course, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=809.36s)]
*  his caving into Trump only intensified after that. He went down to Mar-a-Lago [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=815.36s)]
*  and kissed the ring. And then after the gavel changed hands, he, of course, turned over the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=821.36s)]
*  security tapes to Fox News so they could continue to promote whatever their conspiracy theory to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=826.8s)]
*  George was. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everyone—Kevin McCarthy—Jim Jordan should place a call—he [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  should talk to Kevin McCarthy. He should place a call to Jeff Sessions tonight. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=841.92s)]
*  See how it went to hitch your wagon to the Trump train? See how he ended up in the end? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=845.76s)]
*  Just make a call. Jamie Raskin, Congressman from Maryland. Always a pleasure to have you. Thank [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=851.76s)]
*  you, sir. There are about 13 million people living in the state of Pennsylvania, so why can't [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=856.48s)]
*  Republicans find one of them to run for Senate? Regular viewers of this program will no doubt [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=862.96s)]
*  remember last year's Pennsylvania Senate election between the state's then-Lieutenant Governor John [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=868.48s)]
*  Federman and TV doctor Mehmet Oz. From the very beginning, there was a pretty big problem with [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=872.8s)]
*  Oz's campaign. He has lived in New Jersey for years. That video you're watching on your screen [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  right now, that is a campaign ad for a Pennsylvania Senate seat that Oz recorded from his mansion in [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=883.5999999999999s)]
*  Cliffside Park, New Jersey. Now, at this time, then-candidate Federman was still recovering [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  from a stroke. Remember that? So much of his campaigning was relegated to online spaces, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=894.88s)]
*  where his campaign absolutely bludgeoned Oz with jokes and memes about his carpet-bagging, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=899.44s)]
*  including this video that his campaign commissioned from Snooki, star of Jersey Shore. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=904.8800000000001s)]
*  I heard that you moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania to look for a new job. I know you're [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  away from home and you're in a new place, but Jersey will not forget you. I just want to let [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=916.32s)]
*  you know I will not forget you. And don't worry, because you'll be back home in Jersey soon. This [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=921.2s)]
*  is only temporary. That proved prophetic. In a desperate scramble to seem relatable, Oz released [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=926.72s)]
*  this disastrous video trying to attack Democrats over inflation because fancy crudite platters [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=934.1600000000001s)]
*  were getting too expensive. I thought I was just in grocery shopping. I'm at Wagner's. And my wife [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=939.28s)]
*  wants some vegetables for crudite, right? So here's a broccoli. That's two bucks, about a ton of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=944.32s)]
*  broccoli there. There's some asparagus. That's four dollars. Yep. Carrots. That's four more dollars. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=950.96s)]
*  That's ten dollars of vegetables there. And then we need some guacamole. That's four dollars more. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  And she loves salsa. Yeah, salsa there. Six dollars? Must be as short as her salsa. Guys, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=965.2800000000001s)]
*  that's twenty dollars for crudite. This doesn't include the tequila. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  The Fetterman campaign was quick to note that right off the top, Oz bungled the name of the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  Pennsylvania-based grocery store Redners. And P.A., we call this a veggie tray. And if this [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=981.3599999999999s)]
*  looks anything other than a veggie tray to you, then I am not your candidate. And I'm serious. Dr. Oz [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  doesn't even know the name of the grocery store that he's in. Now, Fetterman ended up winning that [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=996.4799999999999s)]
*  race by about five points, despite suffering the stroke that knocked him off the campaign trail. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1002.08s)]
*  And you would think Pennsylvania Republicans would have learned their lesson, but apparently not. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  Right now, another Republican millionaire, Dave McCormick, has announced he's challenging [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  incumbent Pennsylvania Democrats Senator Bob Casey. And the thing about Dave McCormick is that he [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1016.88s)]
*  lives in Connecticut. In fact, this is so perfect. According to reporting plus flight logs, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  it sure looks like McCormick announced his campaign in Pennsylvania last month and then flew [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1030.88s)]
*  back to Connecticut on a private jet the next day. Now, McCormick tried to justify his Connecticut [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1037.2800000000002s)]
*  residents by claiming he's just a good family man. His daughter lives there, apparently, which, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1044.0s)]
*  you know, good for him. But again, I'm not sure Pennsylvanians are buying it. Like, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  there's lots of Pennsylvanians. Get one of them. Senator Fetterman got back in on the auction with [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1052.16s)]
*  his meme today mocking the second straight PA Republican Senate candidate who does not live [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1057.68s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. It is genuinely downright bizarre that in a state with millions of people and lots [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  of Republicans, they really cannot find a single Republican who actually lives in Pennsylvania to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1069.2s)]
*  run for Senate. It went disastrously last time they did this. I guess we'll see how it goes this time. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urlH5xKRRo&t=1087.68s)]
