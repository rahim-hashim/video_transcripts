# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo)
*  Joining me now to talk about what we just heard are my MSNBC colleagues Joy Reid, host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=0.0s)]
*  of The Readout, and Jen Psaki, host of Inside with Jen Psaki. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=5.0s)]
*  Jen, as someone who worked in a White House doing communications, that was quite a task [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=8.32s)]
*  that he had in front of him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=13.96s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I mean, first, I think we should take a moment and recognize Vladimir Putin is someone Joe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=16.12s)]
*  Biden met with two years ago, and now he just compared him to Hamas in a speech, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=20.96s)]
*  That is a significant road that Putin has traveled. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=26.22s)]
*  What also stuck out to me, Chris, is that he continued to say, if we walk away, if we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=31.02s)]
*  walk away, and the consequences. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=36.16s)]
*  And what I heard there is him reminding the public of the importance of this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=38.34s)]
*  He also said, terrorists, if terrorists don't pay a price, if dictators don't pay a price, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  this will continue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=47.82s)]
*  So what I heard from him is just a reminder to the public of why this is so important [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=49.46s)]
*  for the United States to be engaged, why the United States as an indispensable power [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=54.74s)]
*  needs to be engaged in these conflicts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  I think it was very important, and I don't think it's going to satisfy everybody who [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  is hurting right now and feels in pain right now, but that he talked about not just anti-Semitism, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=65.42s)]
*  but also Islamophobia. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=71.14s)]
*  And those are two concerns also we've seen kind of grow across the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=72.86s)]
*  So a very tricky verbal speech there, no question. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=75.84s)]
*  But I do think, hopefully, what he did was remind people of the stakes here and also [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=80.1s)]
*  take it back to the domestic impact. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=84.58s)]
*  Yeah, he talked, Joy, about when he was talking domestically about some of the things that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=86.34s)]
*  we've seen domestically. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=92.38s)]
*  He talked about Jewish families, and I know I'm sure everyone has experienced this first [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=93.62s)]
*  hand, worried about Jewish day schools, worried about sending their children, worried about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=99.26s)]
*  wearing yarmulkes out in the streets in the days after this attack. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=103.42s)]
*  He talked about the murder of Wadia Alfayumi in Illinois, who was murdered by a man who [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=106.76s)]
*  had been wound up and enraged, apparently, according to his wife, in a sheriff's statement, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=112.54s)]
*  listening to conservative radio, urging Americans not to turn on each other. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  What do you think about that section of the speech, Joy? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=120.62s)]
*  Yeah, and this is the thing that Joe Biden does better than most politicians, the sort [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=122.7s)]
*  of empathy and being able to relate to and connect to the pain of very different communities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=128.66s)]
*  And I think he did that very well, as Biden does, in talking about the pain of the Jewish [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=136.22s)]
*  community, who is terrified. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=142.14s)]
*  The attacks by Hamas raised these fears that are ancient in some ways, that go back decades. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=145.06s)]
*  And then at the same time, there's this little boy, this six-year-old boy, who didn't deserve [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=152.94s)]
*  to pay for that with his life. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=157.28s)]
*  He's just a child. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=158.82s)]
*  And you have Muslim and Arab communities who are not just afraid, but they're also angry. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=160.14s)]
*  And in many instances, they're angry at him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  And to me, this was a difficult tightrope for him to walk, because right now, a lot [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=169.78s)]
*  of Muslim and Arab communities are actually angry not just about what's happening in Gaza [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=174.78s)]
*  and looking at the horrors there and the bomb that exploited near that hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  They're also angry at Joe Biden. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  And I'm not sure that his expressions of empathy do that much to degrade that anger, because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  it was difficult for him to walk this tightrope of describing two unlike conflicts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=198.86s)]
*  I think everyone understands very clearly what Russia is doing to Ukraine, as he said, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=203.06s)]
*  describing Ukraine as being a gift that was given by Russia, and that they can take it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=209.02s)]
*  back at any time and say, but these are unlike conflicts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  In the case of Russia and Ukraine, it is a country trying to annihilate a neighboring [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=218.34s)]
*  democracy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  In the case of Israel and the Palestinians, this is a conflict taking place within one [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=224.7s)]
*  country and the territories it occupies. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=231.82s)]
*  And so these are not neighboring countries in the Middle East. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=235.7s)]
*  It is Israel and its occupied territories. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=239.26s)]
*  It is an internal fight inside that country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  And the issue of occupation was not brought up by President Biden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=253.74s)]
*  They're not the same conflict. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=254.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think he did mention, we should say that he mentioned talking to Mahmoud Abbas, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=257.74s)]
*  who of course is the president of the Palestinian Authority, which has no real role in Gaza, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=262.14s)]
*  controls the West Bank, and saying that he told Mahmoud Abbas that he supports essentially [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=266.74s)]
*  dignity and the right to self-determination, I believe was the phrase he used for Palestinians [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=273.74s)]
*  at Hamas's evil attack, do nothing to diminish belief in that rights. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=278.62s)]
*  To your point, Joy, and Jen, this is I think where the sort of rubber hits the road on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=283.66s)]
*  both these conflicts is, if you're the best speechmaker in the world, you're taking sides [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=287.42s)]
*  in both of them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=294.14s)]
*  There are American allies and there's going to be money and weaponry flowing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=296.02s)]
*  And it's going to be a fair amount of money, not in the context of the American government's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=299.62s)]
*  budget. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=304.02s)]
*  In fact, it's basically a rounding error in the American budget and even in the defense [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=305.02s)]
*  budget, but in sort of sheer dollar terms. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=308.98s)]
*  So, Jen, on both the geopolitics of this, where there's an international audience, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=311.3s)]
*  the domestic politics, there's a certain amount of scattling that's just not really possible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=315.66s)]
*  That is true. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=320.42s)]
*  And I also think a certain amount of things you can't accomplish in a 15-minute speech. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=321.42s)]
*  And when I worked for President Biden, what I know of how he kind of uses these moments [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=327.14s)]
*  and speeches and words is he recognizes that he is going to have to play a role and likely [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=331.82s)]
*  right now in encouraging Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israelis, who he has stood behind [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=339.1s)]
*  publicly very, very strongly, to exercise some caution, to exercise some consideration [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=344.66s)]
*  of civilians and civilian casualties. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  He's going to need to use that leverage. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=356.38s)]
*  That also may mean, and I think likely means, he could not get into details here about occupation [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  or about the history of this conflict, because he is still in a role of playing chief diplomat [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=365.22s)]
*  and the president of the United States. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=370.82s)]
*  And so as much as people want to hear those words and hear that recognition, I mean, some [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=372.7s)]
*  of these people who are leaving Gaza have been refugees multiple times over, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=377.22s)]
*  Their grandparents have been refugees. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=382.64s)]
*  I mean, the pain and suffering, the fact that these people haven't had a home is so visceral. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=384.38s)]
*  But this wasn't the moment in the speech, because he has to think about the role he [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=389.64s)]
*  has to play as president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=393.18s)]
*  Yeah, and there's been reporting on this about the sort of hug Netanyahu strategy, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=394.5s)]
*  That full and 100% public support. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=399.62s)]
*  So as a means of whatever private conversations, back channels and leverage, there can be leverage [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=402.74s)]
*  there because nothing public is going to work. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=407.52s)]
*  Although he did reiterate, I think, the thing that you said, Jen, and I agreed with, what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=410.02s)]
*  I thought was the sort of most significant thing he said about that 9-11 comparison. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=414.54s)]
*  And he made two points about it that I thought were interesting and I think echoed things [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=419.34000000000003s)]
*  that I've been thinking. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=422.38s)]
*  One, the sort of the rage and the anguish and the grief leading to mistakes, that's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=423.58s)]
*  the term he used. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=430.26s)]
*  And also the fear of a kind of hysteria, a kind of self-censorship, a kind of heavy weight [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  that hangs over discourse that means that people either don't worry about what they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  say or they worry about their neighbors. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=443.9s)]
*  Joy, I thought that was an interesting thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=445.5s)]
*  He himself used that touchstone in the speech was striking to me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=447.62s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=451.5s)]
*  And again, this is probably the most difficult tightrope in the world that a president would [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=452.62s)]
*  have to walk and trying to weave these two conflicts together. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=458.06s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=462.1s)]
*  And he talked about people needing to be able to be America. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=463.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=468.02s)]
*  And there is a sense in which Biden is a nostalgia candidate. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=469.02s)]
*  And that Trump is as well, right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=472.58s)]
*  Trump is a nostalgia for something dark in our past. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=475.5s)]
*  But Biden is a nostalgia politician too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=478.02s)]
*  He still refers to America as the essential nation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=481.78s)]
*  He still views America as the greatest peacemaker. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  And he still seems to believe that he can rhetorically call on Americans to also be [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=488.9s)]
*  at peace rhetorically with each other, to be able to talk about this conflict in a way [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=495.14s)]
*  that recognizes that as he says, we're still, we're all Americans, whatever our background, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=499.32s)]
*  we are all the United States of America. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  It's the line he does in every one of his speeches. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's so difficult because we're in this moment where even Joe Biden, who is the sort [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=509.28s)]
*  of most moderate down the middle Democrat you could have possibly nominated for president, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=513.18s)]
*  he has become divisive. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  But I think his, his continual call to return to this idea of a United States of America [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=519.24s)]
*  and to return to a civic dialogue, it is so Biden. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=525.48s)]
*  Joy Reid and Jen Psaki, it was wonderful to have you both before his speech and after. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  I really, really appreciate it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  It is day 16 without a speaker of the House. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=540.16s)]
*  The Republican conference still cannot agree on a candidate to fill the leadership vacuum [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  tonight. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=546.68s)]
*  After yet another day trying to wrangle votes on Capitol Hill, Congressman Jim Jordan of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=548.12s)]
*  Ohio is no closer to the 217 votes he needs to win the gavel on Tuesday. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  As you may recall in the first round of voting, Jordan received 200 votes, 12 fewer than Democratic [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=558.1s)]
*  minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=563.26s)]
*  Today he tried again and suffered a net loss, winning the support of just 199 Republicans. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=566.08s)]
*  Then for a brief period of time today, it looked like Republicans, including Jordan, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  were ready to move forward with a compromise plan. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=578.2s)]
*  It would temporarily empower that man that is Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry of North [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=580.6s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=585.96s)]
*  That deal though apparently fell apart. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=587.36s)]
*  Jordan went right back to work lobbying support for a third vote. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  We thought there might be a vote. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  He met with all 22 Republican holdouts and according to Jake Sherman of Punchball News, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=594.44s)]
*  ready for this? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=599.44s)]
*  Every single one told him they would not back him for speaker. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=601.2s)]
*  Ali Vitale is the Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, David Jolly a former Republican [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=606.12s)]
*  congressman of Florida and they join me now. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=609.8800000000001s)]
*  All right, Ali, I just, you were there today and you've been covering this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=612.08s)]
*  Just I feel like this thing happens where every, it's like a cliffhanger every 24 hours [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=615.34s)]
*  and then a lot happens but in the end we end up in the same place. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=620.5200000000001s)]
*  How did today unfold? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=625.04s)]
*  Oh, you feel that too, Chris? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=627.04s)]
*  I love doing the same live shot for you but 48 hours later. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=629.04s)]
*  So that's awesome. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=633.28s)]
*  I will say it does feel like we just kind of are on this merry-go-round where Republicans [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=634.28s)]
*  keep thinking that they're going to get close to doing something and that it all seems to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  fall apart. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=643.6s)]
*  I think the stunning thing about what we saw from Jim Jordan tonight was the fact that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=644.6s)]
*  initially, you're right, there was a point today where we thought there was going to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=649.4s)]
*  be something bipartisan done to empower Speaker Pro Tem McHenry. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=652.24s)]
*  That ultimately fell apart and after that, Jordan went to meet with the 22 people who [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=657.04s)]
*  are current holdouts for him. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=661.72s)]
*  Now the explanations of that meeting start to fall apart depending on who you talk to. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=663.72s)]
*  For Jordan, it was a chance to speak to his detractors, see if it was a chance to get [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=668.12s)]
*  them on board. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=671.64s)]
*  For the members leaving that meeting though, some of them told our team in the hallway [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=672.72s)]
*  that this wasn't a meeting for Jordan to try to change their minds. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  This was a meeting for them to try to change Jordan's mind and get him to drop out. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=680.62s)]
*  Not a good sign if you're trying to get someone on board for your speaker bid and it's why [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=686.38s)]
*  Jordan wanted to buy himself the time by giving McHenry powers and letting himself try to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=690.82s)]
*  still cobble together votes. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=696.38s)]
*  Yeah, who is whipping who in this meeting one might ask. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=697.98s)]
*  David, so one thing that's happening here that I think is a really interesting dynamic [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=702.34s)]
*  and worth paying attention to. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=706.74s)]
*  We've now seen multiple members of the House Republican Conference who've come out against [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=708.74s)]
*  Jordan saying, reporting security concerns and death threats. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=712.54s)]
*  Multiple members. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=716.86s)]
*  And they're speaking publicly and openly about this, Politico saying multiple members are [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=717.86s)]
*  detailing threats and other intimidation they face for opposing Jim Jordan's speakership [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=720.94s)]
*  bid. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=725.3s)]
*  Ken Buck, and this is not at all in the same category, I want to be clear about that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=726.3s)]
*  Ken Buck said his landlord of his district offices in Colorado is booting him out because [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=728.98s)]
*  of his support of Jordan, which is that, you know, that's fine. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=734.26s)]
*  That's Democratic politics. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=736.1s)]
*  You can do that if you want. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=737.1s)]
*  But the death threats, which have been part and parcel of public life, particularly acutely [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=738.1s)]
*  in the Trump era, for them to be speaking openly and for them not bowing to it, but [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=744.5s)]
*  speaking about it seems to me a little bit of a watershed moment. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=749.9s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=752.78s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, it's very serious. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=753.78s)]
*  I mean, one Republican member reported that their child in middle school, I believe, had [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=755.9s)]
*  to have a sheriff's escort or a sheriff's deputy assigned to the school. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=760.38s)]
*  Another spouse said they slept with a loaded gun last night because of some of this intimidation. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=764.04s)]
*  And so, look, some of it's just grassroots lone actor, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=770.28s)]
*  Probably most of it is. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=773.88s)]
*  But it is also Jim Jordan and his team unleashing the conservative influencers in D.C. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  And also Fox News and Sean Hannity. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=782.56s)]
*  Let's just be honest about it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=784.8s)]
*  But this is where I think, look, the one tool that Jordan wants is time. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=786.16s)]
*  Ali knows this very well. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=790.88s)]
*  He wants time to continue getting to 217. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=792.04s)]
*  I don't think he has it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  I think it's getting untenable because if none of those 22 are going to move, it's just [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=796.16s)]
*  a vanity project for Jordan. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=800.52s)]
*  And I think he knows that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=802.8s)]
*  I think he asked for the vote tomorrow because he cannot go into the weekend not having moved [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=803.8s)]
*  a single vote because then he's just taking time away from other possible speaker candidates [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  and he's sucking the oxygen out of the conference. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=813.52s)]
*  I think as much as Jordan is professing confidence, as much as Fox News is going to come down [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  on people tonight, those 22 need to look over their shoulders. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=820.48s)]
*  I think this is it for Jordan. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=823.8800000000001s)]
*  I think tomorrow's vote should be the last. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=825.48s)]
*  But this is somebody who acts by intimidation and brinkmanship. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=827.8800000000001s)]
*  Jim Jordan, it just doesn't work. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=830.48s)]
*  These people haven't worked in two weeks. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=832.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, in all fairness, they take lots of recesses. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=833.7600000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  They took a recess in the week before that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=838.4000000000001s)]
*  So in all fairness, you know, it's a little like when COVID hit and everyone got taught [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  like you're essential or non-essential. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like, I guess I'm not essential, actually. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like maybe it doesn't really matter. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=846.6400000000001s)]
*  It does, because we are hurling towards a shutdown. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=849.7199999999999s)]
*  The president, obviously, tonight, addressing these these these packages. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  I keep wondering, Ali, like, what is the way out? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=858.1999999999999s)]
*  This the McHenry thing was floated. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=861.56s)]
*  And here's my understanding. I want to tell you, you to tell me if I have this right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=863.16s)]
*  It's a little Weedsey that that Jordan and other pro-Jordan Republicans got onto the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  The thought being maybe you can do that to buy more time to whip with votes. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=874.08s)]
*  And then it fell apart because he said he was going to stay in the speaker race and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=880.96s)]
*  everyone in different directions didn't like that arrangement, I think, is my understanding. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=886.0400000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=891.36s)]
*  My understanding was that in this very lengthy, very tense GOP conference huddle behind [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=892.36s)]
*  closed doors, the fact that Jordan was staying in the race was reason enough for a good [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=898.2s)]
*  chunk of Republican members to say that they wouldn't back a pro tem McHenry bid because [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=903.88s)]
*  they felt that one seemed to undercut the other in some way. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=909.52s)]
*  And so initially, what was meant to be a Jordan time saving and space saving mechanism [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=912.68s)]
*  ended up being not that at all. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=918.28s)]
*  And I think it was really weird to frankly cover the rise and fall of the resolution [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=920.2s)]
*  empowering McHenry, because as we reported in the meeting, McHenry sort of said to everyone [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  Hey, if you try to get me to shoot first and ask questions later, if you try to make me [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=930.96s)]
*  bring something to the floor and test the limits of my power that I don't believe I [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=936.24s)]
*  have, I'll quit. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  You'll figure out who the next person on Kevin McCarthy's list was because it sure ain't [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  going to be me. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=944.56s)]
*  That's a threat that you don't necessarily want when you're already looking for a permanent [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=945.56s)]
*  speaker and your temporary one is like, I will turn this car around. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=949.36s)]
*  Such an important life lesson that credibly saying I'll quit gives you real leverage. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=954.16s)]
*  I want to play what Kevin McCarthy said about the tense. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=960.12s)]
*  There was a lot of tension in that meeting. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=962.72s)]
*  David, I'm going to play for you what McCarthy said about an exchange he had with Matt Gates. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=966.36s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  I was at the mic, I was speaking and Matt Gates tried to interrupt the center. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=971.36s)]
*  I told him to sit down and he sat down. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=974.2800000000001s)]
*  No, I told him to sit down. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=978.2800000000001s)]
*  I think the entire conference screamed at me. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=979.48s)]
*  People are. Listen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gates right now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=981.5200000000001s)]
*  And he's right. But I wonder who's the guy who negotiated Matt Gates to make the motion [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=986.84s)]
*  to dismiss resolution able to be called up with one vote? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=991.8000000000001s)]
*  Whoever did that? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=994.72s)]
*  McCarthy. That's right. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  McCarthy begged Gates for his vote or at least vote president in January. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=997.88s)]
*  He gave him the keys to the House. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1001.84s)]
*  But the amount of vitriol and hatred and distrust in the Republican conference is what is [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  driving all of this. And here's a perfect example why. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1008.32s)]
*  The McHenry temporary solution. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1011.08s)]
*  We always framed it as something that would need Democrats. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1013.24s)]
*  It doesn't need Democrats. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  Republicans could just say, we're going to open the floor for two weeks under McHenry [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1017.72s)]
*  and pass a GOP agenda on the budget in Israel and ignore Ukraine. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1022.0s)]
*  They could actually do that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1025.56s)]
*  They're not even unified in that. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1026.76s)]
*  And, Chris, I would say tonight, coming after the president's speech, there's also a role [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1028.28s)]
*  now, very public role for Senator Schumer and the Senate Democrats. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1032.44s)]
*  We don't often talk about them as a political powerhouse. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1036.64s)]
*  They have an opportunity now to respond to President Biden's address. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1040.32s)]
*  Yep. Moving forward. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1043.64s)]
*  Yep. Draw a contrast with House Republicans and their dysfunction. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1045.96s)]
*  Yeah, something coming out of the Senate. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1049.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1051.0400000000002s)]
*  Alivet Halley, David Jolley, thank you very much. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeWHIQSJzo&t=1051.8000000000002s)]
