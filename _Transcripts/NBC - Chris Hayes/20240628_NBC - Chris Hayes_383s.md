# Could Biden be replaced as the nominee? An open convention, explained
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U)
*  A lot of people today in the wake of last night's debate trying to understand what exactly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=0.0s)]
*  would happen if President Joe Biden were to step aside. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=4.12s)]
*  How would that work? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=7.16s)]
*  How does the party replace the presumptive nominee who would decide on the replacement? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=8.16s)]
*  New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein has been advocating for what's called an open [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=12.92s)]
*  convention. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=16.68s)]
*  He's been looking at the procedures and options, which would all have to flow from Joe Biden [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=17.68s)]
*  himself deciding to release his delegates and stand aside. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=20.8s)]
*  And Ezra Klein joins me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=24.32s)]
*  Guys I want to start on just the first point because I think we're in agreement on this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=26.98s)]
*  and I just want to like level set, which is the only way this happens I think is if Biden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=30.66s)]
*  is persuaded to step aside, right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=36.82s)]
*  Like there's no universe in which there's some essentially rebellion or pooch. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=38.5s)]
*  Yes, barring tragedy, it only happens if Biden steps aside. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=43.74s)]
*  Why do you think he should step aside? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=49.5s)]
*  Let's start with that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=51.06s)]
*  I think there are two levels of this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=52.06s)]
*  You're asking me back in February when I began making these arguments, I felt that he, we [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=54.94s)]
*  had passed a point where he was able to campaign effectively, that you would hear from people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=59.86s)]
*  inside the White House that he's performing the job of the presidency just fine, but you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=64.38s)]
*  would watch him on the trail. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=67.42s)]
*  And they were doing very few interviews, they were skipping the Super Bowl interview, he [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=69.5s)]
*  completely fumbled the press conference around the special counsel report. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=73.22s)]
*  And it just didn't look to me like he was able to perform the act of the presidency. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=77.74s)]
*  Now I think it's more, it's also more substantive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=84.14s)]
*  I just don't really buy that the man we saw there struggling through answers in an improvisational [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=86.86s)]
*  setting, which is often where his very bad moments come from, is less real to the presidency [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=93.62s)]
*  than the man who sort of does better, the president who does stronger, teleprompter [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=99.14s)]
*  speeches. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=103.42s)]
*  They're both there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=104.42s)]
*  I think Biden makes good decisions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=105.42s)]
*  I think he's been a very good president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=106.42s)]
*  But if you ask me in an honest way, if I think I want to see him three years older managing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=108.54s)]
*  a foreign policy crisis, I think that's iffy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=114.06s)]
*  I think that at some point you have to say this is not just an issue of optics, an issue [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  of performance and capacity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  So what is, yeah, I think that's, I think those are both, those are all fair points. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=123.16s)]
*  Again, I continue to think he's done an excellent job as president and in some respects some [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=127.22s)]
*  of the best jobs I've seen in my life actually, in terms of the management of the domestic [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=133.78s)]
*  policy front and legislatively. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=138.58s)]
*  What does it actually mean? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=143.14s)]
*  Like if someone were to come to him, right, and he were to have some crisis of conscience [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=144.62s)]
*  moment and he said, no, like what happens next? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=148.98s)]
*  And wouldn't it just be Kamala Harris? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=152.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=154.06s)]
*  No. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=155.06s)]
*  So what would happen next is you would end up in a contested convention. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=156.06s)]
*  So and it's funny because we have no muscle memory of this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=160.94s)]
*  It seems like a completely crazy thing to do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  And also it is the way every presidential nominee was chosen until the 1970s. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=164.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=169.74s)]
*  It was Chicago where the Democratic convention is this year that led to the end of these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=170.78s)]
*  conventions in 68. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=174.72s)]
*  There was so much chaos. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=176.18s)]
*  There was so much division within the party. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=177.18s)]
*  It leads to Democrats creating this commission, the Governor Fraser Commission. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=179.62s)]
*  It creates new rules. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=183.5s)]
*  They didn't actually mean to throw everything to primaries, but they did. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  So but this used to be how we did it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=188.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=190.78s)]
*  FDR was chosen by convention. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=191.78s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln was chosen by convention. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=192.78s)]
*  They were all chosen by conventions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  And so what you have are the delegates, the elected delegates who in this case would be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=196.22s)]
*  released would go and they would have to ultimately vote in a ticket. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=199.82s)]
*  And the way that ticket would get chosen would have to do with speeches, would have to do [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=204.42s)]
*  with lobbying behind. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=207.98s)]
*  You know, if Joe Biden decided to step down tomorrow, you'd probably have all these possible [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=208.98s)]
*  candidates like Whitmer and Shapiro and Newsom and Harris doing CNN town halls and MSNBC [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=213.54s)]
*  town halls. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=218.74s)]
*  And there would be this sort of media and private campaign to create the momentum that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=219.98s)]
*  would lead to delegates deciding, yes, like this is the ticket we want to organize in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=225.22s)]
*  order to win in November. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you say people say? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  This is a West Wing script like this is wish casting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, yes, that would be that would be a great that would be narratively totally [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=235.3s)]
*  fascinating. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=239.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=240.22s)]
*  But it's so long from Earth one to Earth two. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=241.22s)]
*  It all feels to me a little West Wing right now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=249.62s)]
*  I mean, it's also completely unprecedented to run an 81 year old behind in the polls. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=250.62s)]
*  This is in American history much less unprecedented. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=255.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=257.98s)]
*  And that's how we typically have done this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=259.5s)]
*  But but granted, we don't have the muscle memory of it anymore. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=260.5s)]
*  I don't know what to say about the West Wing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=263.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=265.38s)]
*  Just the fact that it seems dramatic makes it into a TV show. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=266.38s)]
*  I think the question that ultimately ends up needing to be asked here is just how are [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=269.14000000000004s)]
*  you down? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  How are you balancing risk? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm not comfortable making this argument. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't enjoy making this argument. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I like Joe Biden. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  I think he's been a good president. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  I think if you were the Joe Biden of 2012, he would wipe the floor with Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  But it's also not where we are. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=287.78s)]
*  And if you think Donald Trump is an existential threat to American democracy, which is what [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  I believe, which is what I think a lot of people around Joe Biden believe, which is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  what Joe Biden says he believes, then if Biden is not up to the campaign and also potentially [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=295.9s)]
*  not not up to the presidency afterwards, I think you've got to take that pretty seriously. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=301.5s)]
*  To me, the question is not West Wing or not West Wing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  The question here is around Kamala Harris. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=308.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=309.5s)]
*  As you say, Harris would be the presumptive nominee. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=310.5s)]
*  She would be the likeliest nominee. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=312.78s)]
*  And people have very differing assessments of her level of strength. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=314.94s)]
*  I think she's underrated. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  That's not the same as saying I think she's a political juggernaut. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  But would I prefer to have her up on the debate stage last night than Joe Biden? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=323.18s)]
*  I probably would have. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=327.18s)]
*  Do I think she could be well balanced by vice president? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=328.62s)]
*  Probably. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=330.54s)]
*  Look, if Biden were performing more strongly, we wouldn't have this conversation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=331.54s)]
*  But at some point, you have to ask if he's not. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=335.1s)]
*  Is it really the case, a Democratic Party with all of the political talent in it, with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=338.22s)]
*  all these governors, all these senators? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=341.86s)]
*  Is there no one they can put up? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=344.26s)]
*  Or are we just afraid of trying to do something different because it's more comfortable for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=346.22s)]
*  everybody individually to not step out on this? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=350.82s)]
*  Ezra Klein, now writing and podcasting at the New York Times. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc-PUXRmw5U&t=354.3s)]
