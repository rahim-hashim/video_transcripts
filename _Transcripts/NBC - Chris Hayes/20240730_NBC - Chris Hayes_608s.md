# Sen. Warnock on Harris making a play for Georgia
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss)
*  Tonight, Kamala Harris is in Atlanta, headlining a packed rally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the vice president's first visit to Georgia since becoming the de facto Democratic nominee, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=6.48s)]
*  bringing that key battleground state back into play. Harris' place at the top of the ticket has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  swung momentum and enthusiasm back to the Democrats, particularly amongst young voters. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=16.72s)]
*  Who the campaign had hoped to woo with a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=23.12s)]
*  Savage, Vice President Harris told the fired up crowd that this campaign is a fight for the future. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=27.84s)]
*  Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=36.16s)]
*  And I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=40.72s)]
*  led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Each and every one of us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Tonight's rally is just the beginning of a rush of travel for the vice president. She plans to visit [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=65.04s)]
*  six, that's right, six battleground states over four days next week with her as of yet unannounced [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  running mate. As the New York Times points out, that schedule suggests that we should learn who [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=79.12s)]
*  Harris chooses as her vice president by next Tuesday at the latest. And the Times reports [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=84.88s)]
*  that there are five serious contenders remaining in the VEAT states. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=90.16s)]
*  Governors Josh Shapiro of Arizona, Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Andy Brashear of Kentucky, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=95.84s)]
*  as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Also today, the Harris campaign announced a big [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=101.52s)]
*  ad buy to the tune of $50 million ahead of the Democratic National Convention next month. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=108.56s)]
*  The campaign just launched their first ad presenting the vice president as a quote [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=116.4s)]
*  fearless former prosecutor. The one thing Kamala Harris has always been [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=121.12s)]
*  fearless. As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars. As California's attorney [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=128.32s)]
*  general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners. And as vice president, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=135.04s)]
*  she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  That comes amid a dueling new ad from Donald Trump attacking Harris on immigration and the border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=152.48s)]
*  Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, are also following Harris to Atlanta on Saturday. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=158.8s)]
*  In fact, to the exact same venue at Georgia State University where she spoke tonight, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=164.72s)]
*  directly to her opponent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=169.84s)]
*  Because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=188.72s)]
*  Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia, met Vice President Harris at the Atlanta Airport [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=203.52s)]
*  and joined her at the rally tonight. He joins us right now. Senator Raphael Warnock, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=208.88s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us tonight on All In. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=212.72s)]
*  Thank you. So great to be here with you, Jason. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=215.04s)]
*  First off, I just want to say how impressed I am with the organization on the ground that you were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=219.76s)]
*  able to get from the airport to the rally place with Atlanta traffic on 75 this time of day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm very impressed. I got to start off with that. I have been to many a rally in Atlanta. I was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  there the night that you defeated Herschel Walker in a runoff. I've seen the excitement [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=237.76s)]
*  of Abrams campaigns. I've seen the excitement of Asaf campaigns. How does tonight's rally compare [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=242.48s)]
*  to other rallies you've been to politically in Georgia over the last three or four years? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=248.16s)]
*  Oh, tonight's rally is the top of the heap. The energy here, as you can see, is electric. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=254.48s)]
*  The rally is actually over and still there's a great deal of excitement. You can feel it on [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  the ground. I was actually with the vice president. I came down from Washington, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=267.76s)]
*  D.C. with her. And as we were riding through Atlanta, you could see people lined up on the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=272.0s)]
*  streets. You could see them all standing on bridges waiting to greet her to battleground [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=277.36s)]
*  Georgia. We know from experience in Georgia that when we show up, we win, that the path that leads [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=282.32s)]
*  to the White House goes through Georgia. And I think the vice president felt that here tonight. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, we know that in 2020, Georgia was won legitimately by the Biden-Harris ticket with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=295.28s)]
*  only about 11,000 voters, right? What's interesting is Metro Atlanta alone grows by 11,000 voters every [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=303.36s)]
*  two months. So what do you think is going to be different about campaigning this time in 2024, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=311.36s)]
*  with only 98 days left than maybe just four years ago? Because it seems to me like the ground is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=317.92s)]
*  going to be different and there are newer people for Harris to communicate with. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=323.36s)]
*  Well, you know, that is the work of the campaign. And the good news is that the Kamala Harris [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=329.76s)]
*  campaign is already on the ground. Of course, that began with the Biden campaign. That infrastructure [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=335.6s)]
*  is very much in place. I've been back to the state time and time again with the vice president. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=342.8s)]
*  We were just here together about a month ago before she was the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=349.2s)]
*  nominee. And that's because she is taking Georgia seriously. Look, as you point out, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=354.56s)]
*  we won in 2020. The Biden-Harris campaign won. You had Donald Trump calling into our state, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=361.44s)]
*  asking for 11,000 or so votes. The good news is that Kamala Harris is on the ground time and time [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=370.08s)]
*  again trying to earn the vote of Georgians. And she's doing that not simply by showing up [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=376.0s)]
*  for campaigns, but showing up in the ways in which this administration has delivered [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=382.32s)]
*  for the people of Georgia time and time again. We passed the single largest tax cut for middle [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=387.04s)]
*  and working class families in American history. It's called the expanded child tax credit. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=392.88s)]
*  We're going to try to present that again this week in the United States Senate. And the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=398.0s)]
*  Republicans, for some reason, don't seem to want to play ball. They're more interested in providing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=404.64s)]
*  tax cuts to their wealthy friends than they are to ordinary working class people. And so [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  this is the contrast. Elections are about a choice. And the question is, do you want someone who's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=414.96s)]
*  standing on the side of the wealthiest of the wealthy or on the side of ordinary people? Do [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  you believe in a woman's right to choose? Or do you think politicians ought to make that choice? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  Do you want a criminal in the White House? Or do you want someone who has spent her career [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  prosecuting criminals and standing up for working families? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=434.0s)]
*  You know, you mentioned the opposition. The Atlanta Journal Constitution writes that Trump [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=438.32s)]
*  and JD Vance are going to be campaigning together on Saturday in Metro Atlanta. And I'm guessing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=443.68s)]
*  they're probably not going to have a similar crowd. What is going to be necessary for Harris to sort [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=450.72s)]
*  of explain, be it policy-wise or messaging-wise, to keep Georgia purple and or blue? Because we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=458.32s)]
*  know that Trump is going to be supported by a very popular governor. Brian Kemp is going to support [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=465.28s)]
*  him there. Brian Kemp is going to have all of his voter suppression tactics at his fingertips to try [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=469.92s)]
*  to keep Donald Trump in control of that state. What's the Harris campaign got to do to combat that? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=475.68s)]
*  Listen, if I and my colleague, John Ossoff, an African-American man and a Jewish man, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=481.12s)]
*  can win in Georgia, Kamala Harris can win in Georgia. The contrast between these two campaigns [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=489.68s)]
*  could not be more stark. I mean, you literally have a criminal running against a prosecutor. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=497.2s)]
*  But more importantly, I think when you look at the contrast between Project 2025, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=504.08s)]
*  which wants to cut the civil service, that wants to get rid of programs like Head Start—I have to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  tell you, I'm an alum of Head Start. This is a program that invests in the early childhood and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=516.56s)]
*  development of poor children, that makes sure that they are nurtured with reading and literacy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=522.4s)]
*  Without Head Start, I wouldn't be a United States senator. It literally set the foundation for my [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  life. And Project 2025 and JD Vance's of the world somehow think that child care and investing in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  early child care is somehow a problem for American families. I don't know who they're talking to. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=542.64s)]
*  The contrast couldn't be more stark. If you really want people to go to work, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  then you ought to invest in the child care infrastructure. And it's just one of the things [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  that you're going to see time and time again raised in this campaign. And I think as they [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=561.28s)]
*  hear from Kamala Harris, the better for us. And the more they hear from Donald Trump and JD Vance, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=566.56s)]
*  the better for us. Senator Raphael Warnock, thank you so much for starting us off today. I know [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=572.32s)]
*  there's going to be a huge crowd there. It seems like people are still parting in the background. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=578.32s)]
*  So good luck getting out of the rally tonight, and we'll talk again soon. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=581.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymh-XAOEHss&t=584.48s)]
