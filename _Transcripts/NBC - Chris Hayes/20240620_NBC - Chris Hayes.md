# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights June 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU)
*  One of the ways Donald Trump won the 2016 election was through the complete embrace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=0.0s)]
*  of him by evangelicals, both the base and pastors and leaders in that movement. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=4.0s)]
*  One of the most prominent is a pastor named Robert Morris. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=8.64s)]
*  He founded a Texas megachurch in South Lake, Texas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Morris was also a spiritual advisor to Trump while he was in the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=15.88s)]
*  Here he is in the Rose Garden in 2020, just a few rows behind where then Supreme Court [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=19.6s)]
*  nominee Amy Coney Barrett's family and the First Lady are about to sit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=24.36s)]
*  And here is Trump visiting Morris's church earlier that summer, giving his personal assessment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=29.72s)]
*  of the man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=34.96s)]
*  I want to thank pastors Robert Morris and Steve Dullen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=35.96s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=40.2s)]
*  Great people with a great reputation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=41.2s)]
*  I have to say they're great reputation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=42.2s)]
*  And Gateway Church, the team has been incredible in hosting us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=48.32s)]
*  And I'd now like to ask Pastor Morris and Bishop Jackson to lead us in prayer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=52.16s)]
*  Robert Morris just resigned from his church following allegations that he sexually abused [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=59.0s)]
*  a child. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=65.68s)]
*  In a statement to an evangelical news site, Morris said he was involved in an inappropriate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=66.68s)]
*  sexual behavior with a young lady. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=72.4s)]
*  Those are his words. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=75.8s)]
*  He didn't mention that the young lady in question was a 12 year old girl. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=77.36s)]
*  In his statement, Trump's one time spiritual advisor admitted he continued to molest the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=84.32s)]
*  child on quote several occasions over the next few years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=88.12s)]
*  Mike Hickson-Baw is a senior investigative reporter for NBC News who's been all over [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=92.72s)]
*  the story. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  He writes about Pastor Morris in his book, They Came for the Schools, One Town's Fight [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  over Race and Identity and the New War for America's Classrooms. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=101.64s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=105.04s)]
*  Mike, this is something that happened a long time ago that we are learning about now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=107.16s)]
*  Take us through how this came out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=112.68s)]
*  Well, last week the survivor in this case, Cindy Klemenshire, who has tried telling the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=116.12s)]
*  story in different ways for years, came forward in a blog post and spelled out in very clear [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=122.44s)]
*  detail how when she was 12 years old on Christmas in 1982, Pastor Morris, who was a family friend [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=128.28s)]
*  then a young traveling evangelist, invited her into his room, the guest room at her house, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=136.24s)]
*  proceeded to molester the first of several instances where he would do that over the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=143.52s)]
*  next four and a half years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  And as you mentioned in the lead in, Pastor Morris and Gateway Church responded initially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=150.4s)]
*  by saying this is an old sin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=154.8s)]
*  Pastor Morris has addressed this moral failure of this relationship with a young lady and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=158.08s)]
*  you know, he's repented and this has been taken care of. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=164.0s)]
*  Flash forward a few days, there was a lot of pressure around this when people started [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=167.84s)]
*  pointing out, yeah, the young lady was 12, that's a child, and yesterday he resigned [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=171.26s)]
*  from the church that he founded 20 plus years ago. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=177.06s)]
*  Now he had been telling a sort of story about a kind of redemption arc about stepping away [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=180.62s)]
*  from the ministry in the 1980s because he had been confronted by the then girl's father [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=185.26s)]
*  at that time, is that right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=192.44s)]
*  That's right and I've been talking with former Gateway members and former pastors at the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=194.98s)]
*  church, they talk about how he talked about this story all the time and it became kind [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  of like a signature part of his biography that he had this moral failing when he was [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=205.42s)]
*  young and it was around sexual immorality with again, a young lady. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=210.06s)]
*  In some tellings he would describe himself almost as a victim saying that the young lady [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  had a Jezebel spirit and had tempted him and in fact that she's the one that made it continue, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=222.1s)]
*  he tried to stop it and she made it continue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=229.98s)]
*  So he tells these stories as a way of saying you should be open about your sin and come [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=233.34s)]
*  forward but in reality we now know he was covering and papering over the reality of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=236.86s)]
*  child sexual abuse which is a crime. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=244.06s)]
*  He also has been quite a prominent member of the evangelical movement, politically influential, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=248.46s)]
*  there are obviously many evangelical pastors, thousands probably tens of thousands in this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=254.1s)]
*  country, this is a particularly connected and powerful individual. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=260.02s)]
*  Absolutely, yes, Trump's spiritual advisor, he's really leaned into the idea of advocating [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=264.5s)]
*  for a restoration of Christian morality in America through Republican politics and so [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=272.18s)]
*  you see that with him inviting Glenn Beck to speak from the pulpit at his church and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  being aligned with Donald Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=281.62s)]
*  I write about extensively in the book, he's also gotten very engaged over the last few [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=283.38s)]
*  years with kind of warning about the dangers children face in schools and I want to emphasize [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  this that the survivor here in this case, Cindy, doesn't want this story to become just about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=293.62s)]
*  politics, she's very primarily concerned with Robert Morris not being in leadership and kind [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  of attacking the culture that allows this to permeate but at the same time lots of other [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=305.62s)]
*  people have watched as people like Robert Morris have warned that teachers and school [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=310.5s)]
*  librarians are a danger to children because and have used the language that they're grooming [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=316.58s)]
*  children because they have books on their shelves. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=322.18s)]
*  Morris has preached about that from the pulpit and you know, endorsed specific school work [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=325.38s)]
*  candidates who would fight against you know, this Satan's work in school libraries. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=330.82s)]
*  People who saw that play out are really frustrated and outraged now knowing you know, he's pointing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=335.38000000000005s)]
*  at school librarians. Some of these books that were being targeted actually are literature that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=342.18s)]
*  describe grooming as a way of helping kids understand what warning signs to watch out for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=348.1s)]
*  and so to have him be standing in the pulpit warning about this given his history has been [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  you know, a lot really difficult for people to process and there's a lot of anger both [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=360.42s)]
*  among survivors and educators who've been targeted by this rhetoric. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=366.42s)]
*  Yeah, I would note in 2017 as you reported he called on parishioners to support a bill [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=370.1s)]
*  pitched by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, as a way to quote, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  protect the safety of women and children that would have banned transgender people from using [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=376.98s)]
*  public bathrooms that correspond with their genders. Important to protect children from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=380.98s)]
*  sexual abuse. On that I agree. Mike Hixenbaugh, thank you very much. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=387.3s)]
*  Thanks Chris. Mike's excellent new book that came for the schools, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=392.18s)]
*  One Town's Fight Over Race and Identity and the New War for American Classrooms is out now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=395.54s)]
*  I suggest you check it out. Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. It is that time of year [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=400.34s)]
*  when Donald Trump's right-wing Supreme Court waits until the very end of the term to bludgeon us [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=406.82s)]
*  with their decisions. There are 21 opinions remaining, but we are all holding our breath [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=411.3s)]
*  for one in particular that has a kind of clock ticking. Of course, that is Trump v. United [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=417.14s)]
*  States. The former president's claim that he is immune from being criminally prosecuted for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=422.98s)]
*  anything he did while he was in the White House. Now all of the justices are, you know, adult-grown [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=428.1s)]
*  human beings who can read the newspaper and know that time is of the essence in this case. We are [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  less than five months away from the election when Donald Trump will have, if you look at polls now, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=438.42s)]
*  basically a 50-50 shot at taking back the Oval Office. But at every turn, this court, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=443.3s)]
*  the conservative majority of this court, one has to imagine, has dragged its feet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=448.98s)]
*  The federal case against Donald Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election charges [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=454.1s)]
*  him with four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. It has been on hold [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=458.26s)]
*  for more than six months. The judge in that case, federal district Judge Tonya Chutkin, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=464.42s)]
*  was forced to pause the case all the way back on December 13th of last year amid Trump's immunity [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=470.42s)]
*  appeal. That was 189 days ago. The Supreme Court finally agreed to take up the case on February [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  28th. They heard arguments at the end of April, and we are still waiting. 112 days have passed [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=483.94s)]
*  with nothing, no decision from the Supreme Court, no movement towards a trial that could hold Donald [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=491.06s)]
*  Trump accountable for his attempted insurrection, and also demonstrate to voters whether the man is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=497.3s)]
*  guilty or not guilty of the grave crimes with which he is charged. Now, to be clear, as we've [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=502.02s)]
*  often said on this show, the wheels of justice do move slowly, but this is not normal. As law [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=508.58s)]
*  professor Leah Lippman puts it in an opinion piece in New York Times today, something's rotten about [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=514.18s)]
*  the justices taking so long on Trump's immunity case. She goes on to explain, quote, Mr. Trump's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=518.98s)]
*  lawyers put together a set of arguments that are so outlandish they shouldn't take much time to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=524.02s)]
*  dispatch. The Wall Street Journal also notes that this term as a whole, the whole Supreme Court term, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=528.34s)]
*  is moving at a historically slow pace. Quote, according to Adam Feldman, creator of the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=534.58s)]
*  Empirical Scodas blog, the justices are completing decisions at the second slowest rate since the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=540.58s)]
*  1946 term. Now, keep in mind each justice has a team of four very bright and industrious law clerks [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=547.14s)]
*  assisting them, and they only work nine months out of the year. It's also really worth remembering [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=554.58s)]
*  the last time the Supreme Court heard a case this pressing, the direct analog. It involved a corrupt [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=560.1s)]
*  Republican president. It was in 1974. It had United States in the title, United States versus Nixon. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=566.34s)]
*  That, of course, was when then sitting President Nixon claimed he was immune from complying with [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=573.3s)]
*  the subpoena in the Watergate investigation because of executive privilege. In that case, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=580.18s)]
*  the Supreme Court managed to move much more expeditiously. Good evening. The U.S. Supreme [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=585.54s)]
*  Court, acting as swiftly as it ever has today, announced it will review the special Watergate [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=592.66s)]
*  prosecutor's complaint against President Nixon. It was just one week ago today when Leon Jaworski [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=598.66s)]
*  asked the court to rule on the president's defiance of a subpoena for more White House tapes. It was [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=605.06s)]
*  yesterday when the president's lawyer asked the court not to rush to judgment and allow the case [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=610.74s)]
*  to be heard in the Court of Appeals. But this afternoon, the court said it would hear oral [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=616.26s)]
*  arguments in about five weeks, which set the stage for a possible confrontation between the president [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=621.4599999999999s)]
*  and the high court on the issue of executive privilege. At 3 30, the weekly conference ended. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=627.38s)]
*  10 minutes later, the chief justice issued a single sheet of paper setting in motion the biggest [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=632.9799999999999s)]
*  constitutional test of presidential power since the Civil War. In the case now entitled United [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=638.18s)]
*  States of America versus Richard Nixon president, the court agreed to settle the question whether [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=644.26s)]
*  the president can be compelled to furnish evidence to the Watergate special prosecutor. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=649.3s)]
*  Bypassing the Court of Appeals, the court said brief should be submitted June 21st [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  and replies July 1st. The historic argument was set for July 8th. Good evening. The Supreme Court [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=659.62s)]
*  of the United States today heard three hours of arguments that could very well determine [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=667.1400000000001s)]
*  President Nixon's chances of staying in office for a full term. There were two principal questions [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=671.1400000000001s)]
*  before the court, whether Mr. Nixon can be forced to give up an additional 64 White House tapes to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=676.26s)]
*  the special prosecutor and whether the federal grand jury was within its jurisdiction when it [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=681.78s)]
*  named the president and unindicted co-conspirator. The thrust of the argument centered on the release [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=687.06s)]
*  of the additional tapes. A decision is expected in a week or two. Even before this morning's [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=692.1s)]
*  argument, one justice was writing and circulating his ideas. Another had his clerk prepare a draft [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=696.9s)]
*  opinion. Good evening. President Nixon has not yet responded to the sledgehammer decision of the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=702.66s)]
*  Supreme Court today, which ruled that he must immediately turn over tapes of 64 presidential [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=708.18s)]
*  conversations. In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the court rejected [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=714.3399999999999s)]
*  eight to nothing. Mr. Nixon's claim of absolute privilege on those tapes. The court said the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  president's claim of absolute privilege would upset the constitutional balance of a workable [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=726.5s)]
*  government. It said its ruling was only that the president had to give way in criminal proceedings, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=731.2199999999999s)]
*  a very limited intrusion since presidents would rarely be involved in criminal cases. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=736.18s)]
*  So five decades ago, the court took less than two months to decide president Nixon's case. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=741.54s)]
*  They agreed to hear the case on May 31st, 1974. You see it there. They gave each set of lawyers [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=746.8199999999999s)]
*  three weeks to file their briefs. Then 10 days after that to reply. The court heard oral arguments [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  on July 8th and just 16 days later, just over two weeks, they issued their unanimous opinion, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=757.4599999999999s)]
*  rejecting President Nixon's claim of executive privilege in total from start to finish, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=764.18s)]
*  all done in 54 days. Just 54 days to decide Richard Nixon's case. And we are still waiting [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=769.3s)]
*  for the outcome of Donald Trump's after 112 days and counting. These are similar cases [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=775.62s)]
*  with similar urgency. President Nixon was making a completely a historical unconstitutional claim [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  of immunity because he did not want to turn over his tapes in the Watergate investigation. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=788.5s)]
*  The court ruled no, the president is not a king and does not get to ignore the laws. Donald Trump [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=792.98s)]
*  is once again arguing the president is a kind of king, that he can do anything and everything, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=797.94s)]
*  including ordering the assassination of his political rivals and not face prosecution unless [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=801.78s)]
*  impeached and convicted. And yet the court dragged its feet. Members of that court, all of them, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=807.22s)]
*  knowing full well every day they delay makes it less and less possible that Trump will stand trial [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=814.26s)]
*  for the insurrection before this next election. Leah Litman is the author of that New York Times [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=818.98s)]
*  Outbedge. She's a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and co-host of the Strict [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  Scrutiny podcast along with Melissa Murray and my wife, Kate Shaw, and she joins me now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=828.1s)]
*  It's great to see you, Leah. I love this piece, partly because you just walked through the timeline, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=832.26s)]
*  which inspired us to do so as well. Why do you not think there's a good faith explanation here [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  that it's complex or that this court is moving slowly because they have weird, there's some [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=844.9799999999999s)]
*  weird factional battles happening behind the scenes? I think this court has lost the benefit [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=850.0999999999999s)]
*  of the doubt and the presumption of good faith for any number of reasons. One is that they are [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=856.5s)]
*  more than capable of acting quickly, even in difficult cases where there is disagreement. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=860.66s)]
*  The Trump disqualification case arising out of Colorado, where the Colorado state court took him [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=865.14s)]
*  off the ballot, that resulted in a divided opinion. The court still was able to get it out [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=869.86s)]
*  before Super Tuesday, before people went to cast their ballots, and within a month of the oral [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=875.22s)]
*  argument. Here, there might well be division, and yet the court has taken two months since oral [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=879.78s)]
*  argument. The arguments in the case, I think, are way more outlandish than any of the arguments on [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=885.14s)]
*  behalf of disqualifying a president who participated in the January 6th insurrection. You add to that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=890.34s)]
*  all of the indications of the justices, let's say extracurricular activities, like Justice Alito [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=895.7s)]
*  flying multiple stop the steal flags associated at his house. And all of that, I think, is more [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=900.9000000000001s)]
*  than enough indication that this court just cannot be trusted to actually follow the rules and adhere [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=907.1400000000001s)]
*  to the legal process when it comes to cases involving Donald Trump. That point about the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=913.0600000000001s)]
*  Colorado case is great. I had totally forgotten that timeframe, right? So in there, the clock [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  that's ticking is they've got to print the ballots, I think, for Colorado. They were going [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=922.42s)]
*  to actually vote. They were going to send them out to mail them. And of course, the notion was, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  if we don't act, he's not going to be in the ballot, right? So the sort of constraining thing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=931.78s)]
*  they had to do was like, if we don't act quickly, Donald Trump won't be on the ballot. In this, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=935.9399999999999s)]
*  it's totally flipped. If we don't act, then nothing happens to our guy, and they seem to be taking [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=941.78s)]
*  longer. Yes, that's exactly right. And I think if you go back to the oral argument in the Trump [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=947.46s)]
*  immunity case, you saw the Republican justices attempt to interject basically every other [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=953.7800000000001s)]
*  possibility into this case, aside from the case they were actually being asked to decide. So Justice [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=959.5400000000001s)]
*  Alito, for example, floated the possibility to the special counsel's office. Well, what if a [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=965.0600000000001s)]
*  president just made a mistake? Could he prosecuted then? As if the stop the steal movement was just [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=969.7s)]
*  some kind of oopsie that the president had engaged in or the former president had engaged in for the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=974.58s)]
*  last two months. I mean, this case doesn't involve a simple mistake. And if you look back to the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=978.9000000000001s)]
*  Nixon case, there, the Supreme Court basically said, we don't have to resolve absolutely everything [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=983.38s)]
*  related to immunity. All we have to say is presidents aren't immune from criminal process [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=988.6600000000001s)]
*  based on some generalized definition of confidentiality. There are six days to go [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=994.5s)]
*  until Election Day in New York, and we already have the most expensive congressional primary [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1000.58s)]
*  in American history. It's happening in the 16th district where Representative Jamal Bowman faces [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1006.0200000000001s)]
*  a challenge from a fellow Democrat, Westchester County Executive George Latimer. More than $22 [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1011.14s)]
*  million have been poured into this race. Again, this is a primary between two Democrats in a D [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1016.82s)]
*  plus 20 district. Why all that spending? Where is it coming from? Well, this race isn't really [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1021.94s)]
*  about the candidates, at least the spending part of it. It's more about the shape of politics in [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1028.26s)]
*  the post Citizens United era. Just take a look at this bar chart here. Here are the five top spenders [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1033.14s)]
*  in New York 16, according to the data from ad impact. Both the candidates are there as well as [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1040.02s)]
*  some groups you would expect in a liberal Democratic primary. The vast majority of all the ad spending [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1045.14s)]
*  in this primary $14 million is coming from over there on the left from a single super PAC called [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1051.06s)]
*  the United Democracy Project or UDP. They are the sole reason this is the most expensive primary [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1056.42s)]
*  ever in American history. Now, UDP is a super PAC created and largely funded by the pro-Israel lobby [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1062.98s)]
*  group, a PAC. And it's not surprising that a PAC and its associated groups are going after Democrats [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1068.74s)]
*  like Bowman specifically. Ever since he gained his seat by knocking off longtime incumbent Elliott [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1074.5800000000002s)]
*  Engel back in 2020, Bowman has been aligned with the progressive squad in the house and he has been [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1079.8600000000001s)]
*  criticizing the Israeli government calling for a ceasefire in its war with Gaza. His opponent, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1084.98s)]
*  George Latimer, basically takes the opposite positions. He supports Israel's continued war [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1091.06s)]
*  and opposes a ceasefire. And you might think, okay, yeah, fair enough. That is a very divisive issue [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1095.3s)]
*  among the Democratic electorate in a primary. That's what primaries are for, right? But here's [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1101.46s)]
*  the thing. UDP, the pro-Israel super PAC, didn't drop $14 million of pro-Israel ads on this race. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1106.82s)]
*  In fact, it didn't mention Israel in its ads at all. Jamal Bowman has his own agenda and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1114.98s)]
*  refuses to compromise. Even with President Biden, George Latimer is putting people ahead of personal [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1122.34s)]
*  agendas and delivering real progressive results. Apparently the choice not to mention Israel in any [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1127.94s)]
*  ads was a strategic one on the part of the pro-Israel super PAC funding those ads. A UDP spokesman telling [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1134.74s)]
*  Politico last month, we run ads on the issues voters are most focused on, which again is a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1140.42s)]
*  little odd because like it is sort of a big issue, you'd imagine, but it seems almost as if the pro-Israel [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  group thinks that pro-Israel ads might not actually play as well as they would hope in a heavily [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1152.1000000000001s)]
*  Democratic district like Bowman's. So instead, the group that can make unlimited expenditures is using [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1158.5800000000002s)]
*  its money to attack Bowman, as you saw in that ad, for being insufficiently loyal to President Biden, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1164.66s)]
*  his agenda that does play in a heavily Democratic district. The irony, as Slate revealed last spring, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1170.74s)]
*  is that most of UDP's top funders are Republican mega donors, including Bernie Marcus, the former [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1177.22s)]
*  CEO of Home Depot, Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, and Paul Singer, who also famously [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1184.42s)]
*  took Sam Alito on that luxury fishing trip. But it gets even weirder, okay? If you look back at that bar chart, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1190.1s)]
*  there's another super PAC there. That's Fair Shake. See that there next to George Latimer in between [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1197.9399999999998s)]
*  Jim Bob Bowman. Now, Fair Shake is a super PAC backed by cryptocurrency interests who want to keep crypto [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1204.02s)]
*  lightly regulated. They are running ads against Bowman too, but they are not running ads on crypto. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1211.2199999999998s)]
*  They are running ads on, wait for it, Israel. This is what Citizens United has wrought. Enormous [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1218.18s)]
*  swarms of big money from anodyne sounding groups pounding a candidate while concealing what their [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1226.82s)]
*  own interests are. It's a bizarre perversion of genuine Democratic discourse that does not serve [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1232.74s)]
*  voters, but it works great for mega donors. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj23_nmGlyU&t=1239.14s)]
