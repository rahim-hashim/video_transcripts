# ‘Freaks and geeks’ Meet the MAGA candidates running for office in 2024
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk)
*  It is another election cycle in the Trump era and as in previous cycles, the Republican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=0.0s)]
*  Party is fielding a bunch of candidates we like to call, apologies to Paul Feig, freaks [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=5.2s)]
*  and geeks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=9.9s)]
*  It has been a feature of this era, the Trumpiest elements of the party has seized control at [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=10.9s)]
*  the grassroots level and from that purge and in primary contests, they've successfully [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=15.6s)]
*  elevated extreme candidates who are downright repellent to swing voters in otherwise winnable [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  races. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=26.36s)]
*  Whatever mojo Trump has when he runs, which again, contested, he lost the popular vote [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=27.76s)]
*  twice, it proved to not be particularly replicable by his strange fellow Republicans down ballot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=32.64s)]
*  We saw this in 2022 of course, remember there was supposed to be a massive red wave in that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=39.92s)]
*  election but Republicans didn't have candidates who could surf the wave. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=43.56s)]
*  They fielded Herschel Walker from the Senate in Georgia, a 1980s NFL star who, like Trump, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=48.08s)]
*  had no political experience and a reputation for serial dishonesty. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  And when he was being honest, he was, well, rarely coherent. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=57.54s)]
*  The other night I was watching this movie, I was watching this movie called Fright Night, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=60.58s)]
*  Freak Night, or some type of night, but it was about vampires. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=65.62s)]
*  I don't know if you know vampires and cool people, are they not? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=68.5s)]
*  But I'm going to tell you something that I found out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=70.98s)]
*  A werewolf can kill a vampire, did you know that? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=73.26s)]
*  I never knew that so I didn't want to be a vampire anymore, I wanted to be a werewolf. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=75.82s)]
*  Then there was Pennsylvania where the Republican candidate for governor was Doug Mastriano, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=79.74s)]
*  pictured there on the left at the Stop the Steal rally at the Capitol on January 6th [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=83.54s)]
*  just before the violent insurrection. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=87.94000000000001s)]
*  You can also see the election denying QAnon embracing Mastriano in this photograph at [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=89.9s)]
*  the left in his Confederate Civil War uniform. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  Then there was Kerry Lake who ran for governor in Arizona, former TV news reporter who campaigned [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=99.06s)]
*  against the fake news media, not only parroted Trump's lies about the 2020 election, she [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=103.04s)]
*  also subsequently claimed her own election was stolen and still does. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=107.94000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Lake, who is not the governor, though she thinks she is or that she won the governorship, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=112.38s)]
*  she's on the ballot again this year. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=117.7s)]
*  She is running for Senate against the popular war veteran Ruben Gallego, who's a congressman [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=118.98s)]
*  from Arizona. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=123.58s)]
*  She's been losing to Gallego in every major poll taken in that race since February, which [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=124.58s)]
*  is to say Republicans are doing the exact same thing again this cycle. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=130.6s)]
*  Notably in Minnesota, where to take on incumbent Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, Republicans [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=134.54s)]
*  have nominated Royce White, a former NBA player turned info wars lover, a guy who has advanced [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=139.14s)]
*  conspiracy theories about everything from Nancy Pelosi's husband and the Federal Reserve, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=145.26s)]
*  while reportedly managing to owe over $800,000 in child support, is now having to answer [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=150.1s)]
*  questions about why his campaign spent $1,200 at a Florida strip club. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  Your claim is there were filings which said you spent campaign funds at a strip club, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  they were incorrect. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  No, they didn't say that I spent the funds at a strip club or no, let's say they didn't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  say that I spent the funds on strippers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=173.06s)]
*  But it was spent at a strip club. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=176.52s)]
*  Well, strip club as they sell food at the strip club. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  So you were having you've spent the money on food at a strip club. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  Is that more accurate? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=184.34s)]
*  You seem to be very unfamiliar with strippers and strip clubs and drag strip shows. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  So I'll inform you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=188.94s)]
*  Maybe you are informed that they do have food at strip clubs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  Delicious. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=194.02s)]
*  Wright has also rallied against railed against the Jewish elite. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=195.7s)]
*  He's complained that women have become too mouthy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=199.54s)]
*  He described the LGBTQ movement as Luciferian. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=201.61999999999998s)]
*  You kind of get the idea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=204.94s)]
*  But that's not an isolated incident. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=205.94s)]
*  There's a Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina, a guy named Mark Robinson, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=207.66s)]
*  who has spent years posting unbelievable bile about gay folks and Jewish Americans, black [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  folks, even from denying the Holocaust happened to claiming the movie Black Panther was, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  I quote here, created by agnostic Jew and put to film by a satanic Marxist to extract [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=221.3s)]
*  money from black people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=226.78s)]
*  Robinson has ranted against women and abortion so many times that his Democratic opponents [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  stitched them together into one absolutely brutal ad. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  Let's say I was the governor and had a will and legislation with the pass the bill say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  you can't have an abortion in North Carolina for any reason. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  For me, there is no compromise on abortion. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  It makes no difference to me why or how that child is going to be born. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=248.06s)]
*  The abortion in this country is not about protecting the lives of mothers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=252.14s)]
*  It's about killing the child because you are responsible enough to keep your skirt down. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=257.9s)]
*  It's not your body anymore. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=264.1s)]
*  Killing a child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=268.62s)]
*  Running for governor in North Carolina. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=274.9s)]
*  This dynamic is haunting Republicans everywhere, including Indiana, where Republican Senator [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=276.78s)]
*  Mike Braun is now running for governor. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=281.26s)]
*  Now, Braun came prepared with his own pick for lieutenant governor, but rather than a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=283.06s)]
*  seed to his wishes, the state party convention selected Micah Beckwith, a Pentecostal pastor, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=286.7s)]
*  podcaster and self-described Christian nationalist whose only public service experience was an [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=292.74s)]
*  unsuccessful attempt to purge controversial books in his local library. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=297.5s)]
*  Beckwith also gained notoriety the day after the Capitol insurrection for claiming that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=301.94s)]
*  God had spoken to him and endorsed the rioters. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=306.58s)]
*  A lot of people are freaking out over what they saw, and I can totally understand that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=310.94s)]
*  But I was in prayer this morning, and you know what the Lord told me? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=316.42s)]
*  He said, Micah, he said, I sent those riots to Washington. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=320.94s)]
*  He said, what you saw yesterday was my hand at work. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  It's always in the car, those videos, aren't they? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=330.58s)]
*  As Michelle Goldberg wrote recently in New York Times, party insiders are freaked out [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=333.82s)]
*  that Beckwith's candidacy gives Democrats an opening in a truly red state. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=338.1s)]
*  She adds that Beckwith's elevation is the latest sign of a conflict splitting Republican parties [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=341.1s)]
*  nationwide as GOP activists demand ever greater levels of purity and belligerence from their [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=345.38s)]
*  leaders. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=350.54s)]
*  Now, the crazy thing is that even when the party elites get the candidates they wanted, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=351.54s)]
*  they tend not to be appreciably more palatable to mainstream voters. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=357.14s)]
*  Remember in Pennsylvania when they got TV Dr. Oz to run for Senate, even though his [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=361.3s)]
*  primary residence was across the river New Jersey? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=365.08s)]
*  Well, in place of Oz this year, Republicans are running David McCormick, another rich [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=367.4s)]
*  carpet bagger who spends most of his time at a $16 million mansion in Connecticut, bought [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=372.84s)]
*  with his hedge fund wealth. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=377.8s)]
*  And he's not alone. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=379.74s)]
*  To challenge Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, which is a very contested swing state, Republicans [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=381.4s)]
*  have selected Eric Hovde, the CEO of a Utah-based bank who lives in a $7 million oceanfront [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=386.08s)]
*  mansion in Laguna Beach, California, not far from his main office. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=392.44s)]
*  Hovde also recently took fire for defending his claims about voting irregularities by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=396.92s)]
*  suggesting that residents of nursing homes are too close to death for their votes to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=401.0s)]
*  count. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=406.92s)]
*  All this is a reminder of the weird paradox of the Trump era that only Trump actually [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=409.48s)]
*  gets away with being Trump-like. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=414.68s)]
*  For everybody else, being outrageous and offensive and polarizing and repellent does come with [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=416.88s)]
*  some political costs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=421.38s)]
*  For them, gravity does exist. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=422.5s)]
*  And this has led Republicans to pay very tangible costs in lots of winnable races over and over [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=425.0s)]
*  and over again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=429.1s)]
*  They should have majority in the Senate, honestly, with better candidates. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=430.1s)]
*  This election so far is looking to be a similar story. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=434.3s)]
*  But of course, there's still the guy at the top of the ticket who has last count 34 felony [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=438.7s)]
*  convictions and is running neck and neck with the incumbent president. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=444.12s)]
*  Talk about that next. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv3eIqrdDmk&t=448.54s)]
