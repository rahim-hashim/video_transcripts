# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 30
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw)
*  Joining me now are two people who are at the courthouse today, former federal prosecutor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=0.0s)]
*  Harry Lippman and MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=3.4s)]
*  Okay, a lot to get to today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=6.88s)]
*  Let's sort of start where I ended on Keith Davidson, who's sort of an important substantive [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=9.64s)]
*  witness. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Tell us who Davidson is and what he was going through today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=16.8s)]
*  Davidson is the lawyer for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=20.12s)]
*  And so prosecutors were taking him through the negotiation of the settlement payments [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=23.12s)]
*  which Chris, as you know, operated very differently. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=28.04s)]
*  The first one, AMI handled. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=30.64s)]
*  The second one, David Pecker already testified. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=32.88s)]
*  He told Dylan Howard, do not get involved in this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=35.56s)]
*  I do not want any affiliation with the porn star. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=38.8s)]
*  It endangers our distribution deal with Walmart. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=41.44s)]
*  And also, I am not a bank. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Nonetheless, Dylan Howard did get involved and he got involved by involving Keith Davidson, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=46.2s)]
*  who had a prior relationship with Stormy Daniels' manager, Gina Rodriguez, herself [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  described as sort of an infamous story broker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=56.92s)]
*  This is the seamy underbelly of the world that David Pecker sort of took us through. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=59.68s)]
*  This is a rung below the inquirers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=66.4s)]
*  That is too sketchy for us, the National Enquirer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=71.92s)]
*  You need to go run this as an off book operation because again, us, the National Enquirer, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=75.2s)]
*  find this to be too dubious. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=80.0s)]
*  And I'm glad you used the word sketchy because sketchy comes to mind when I think about Keith [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=81.0s)]
*  Davidson. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=85.0s)]
*  He was not an easy witness for the prosecution, although an important one. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=86.0s)]
*  And I think part of that is because he did not want to acknowledge his full complicity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=89.24s)]
*  in either of these deals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=93.72s)]
*  He was shadowy, for example, about how he got involved in representing Stormy Daniels [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=95.0s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's a weird gig. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  And how the deal was resurrected after he told Michael Cohen in mid-October after Cohen [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  had failed to fund the settlement, I'm out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=105.94s)]
*  And by the way, I don't represent Stormy Daniels or Gina Rodriguez anymore. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  Nonetheless, Michael Cohen gets called back into action and that whole deal gets papered [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=113.2s)]
*  in a matter of like 24 hours. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=117.92s)]
*  We know that because of the Baker. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=119.88s)]
*  What was your impression? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=122.56s)]
*  I know I think both of you sort of were on the same page that Pecker was, he was an interesting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=123.56s)]
*  witness and credible and sort of frank and very, and not shadowy and not squirrely and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=128.64s)]
*  sort of very upfront about what he does and what world he operates in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=133.16s)]
*  And for that reason was a fairly credible witness, I think was the judgment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=135.92s)]
*  What did you think of Davidson today? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=139.68s)]
*  Look, I thought Davidson was also basically straight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=141.68s)]
*  And the most important is he really brought us to the precipice of Stormy Daniels and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=144.12s)]
*  the huge crisis that it is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  There was the all these sort of bland text at every sort of step. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=151.6s)]
*  And then when the Access Hollywood tape hits, you have him talking to Dylan Howard and say, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=156.56s)]
*  he is so effed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=162.64s)]
*  And it's the end, wave the white flag. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=166.12s)]
*  So in other words, he was very effective in reinforcing the notion that at this point, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=168.72s)]
*  it's a nitroglycerin crisis that has to be dealt with. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=175.68s)]
*  When Planet Hollywood drops. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=180.52s)]
*  When Access Hollywood drops. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=181.96s)]
*  Sorry, Access Hollywood, I always do that, it's so funny. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=182.96s)]
*  I don't want to defame the wonderful restaurant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=186.2s)]
*  So the business idea that... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=190.68s)]
*  So the key sort of... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=193.44s)]
*  The key kind of narrative point that I took away again, and I'm following this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=195.8s)]
*  I haven't read the transcript of your tape. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm following these in the Slack channel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  But the idea that there was the McDougal deal, that it set off some alarms internally at [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=201.68s)]
*  AMI. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=208.68s)]
*  Then there's the Stormy deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=209.68s)]
*  And then the Stormy deal kind of sputters out and Michael Cohen is being squirrely and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  not really coming up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=215.0s)]
*  And that's dead. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=216.8s)]
*  And what resurrects it is the crisis of the Access Hollywood. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=217.96s)]
*  Well, yes and no. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=221.52s)]
*  Because crisis of Access Hollywood is what precipitates the initial deal negotiations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=222.8s)]
*  At some point it falls apart. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=227.08s)]
*  Oh, it falls apart after... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  In mid-October after Access Hollywood already happens. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  But Dylan Howard and others decide it has to be dealt with because Stormy Daniels and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  Gina Rodriguez are sort of now separated from Keith Davidson, are going out and shopping [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  her story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=245.06s)]
*  So you've got a real problem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=246.06s)]
*  You've got to... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=247.06s)]
*  And that's the bigger point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=248.06s)]
*  There are hiccups in the road, but the urgency is always there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=249.06s)]
*  And that's the thing that's most important because really what is the defense going to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=252.0s)]
*  say about that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=256.04s)]
*  It's all set up to try to really savage Michael Cohen, but he's out there paying $130,000 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=257.48s)]
*  knowing that he can't even take someone to lunch without Trump's approval. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=264.0s)]
*  What's the actual narrative that has him doing that that isn't trying to put out this huge [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=267.88s)]
*  fire? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=273.52s)]
*  But I will say Keith Davidson was really impossible for the prosecution today because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=274.52s)]
*  he would not say, at least in response to a question that Mershon would allow, that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=278.72s)]
*  he understood that Trump was the ultimate pocketbook for the Stormy Daniels settlement. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=284.56s)]
*  And prosecutors desperately wanted him to say that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=290.8s)]
*  And I think there were experienced lawyers in the room, Harry included, sort of looking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  at him being like, can you ask this question in a way the guy can answer? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  But he needed to lay the foundation for the fact that Keith Davidson had an understanding [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  at all that it wasn't just an assumption that Trump was going to pay it, but that it wasn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=306.32s)]
*  just Cohen freelancing either. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=311.52s)]
*  And they didn't get that neatly and cleanly today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=313.32s)]
*  They might on Thursday. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=315.32s)]
*  There was a bunch of texts between the two that were displayed today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=317.32s)]
*  I think we might even have some courtroom sketches of this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=320.32s)]
*  And these are texts between the inquirer, the AMI due Dylan Howard, who's not Pecker, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  and Davidson. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=329.96s)]
*  What is the substance of those exchanges? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think the substance of those exchanges is mostly to show, A, these guys were in touch [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=334.16s)]
*  very, very, very frequently. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, this was, they're working this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  They're working this deal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  And they both understand that both sides have an interest in coming to these agreements, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=344.92s)]
*  first McDougal and then Stormy Daniels. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=351.04s)]
*  Even though Davidson testified, he sort of wanted to rid himself of the whole thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=353.72s)]
*  He found Cohen loathsome and detestable. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=359.0s)]
*  He kind of, you know, just when he thinks he's out, he gets pulled back into doing this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=360.28s)]
*  deal. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=364.48s)]
*  Two sides of the same seeming world. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=365.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=367.08s)]
*  Let's talk about, just quickly here, 90 seconds. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=368.08s)]
*  I'm going to put on the clock for you to talk about the strangeness of the E. Jean Carroll [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=370.32s)]
*  deposition court reporter and the C-SPAN archives. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=375.32s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=378.8s)]
*  Quite clearly what it was about is what you said, that they were being obstreperous and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=380.64s)]
*  not stipulating. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=384.6s)]
*  Everybody stipulates. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=387.16s)]
*  We're going through the sort of first grade, first year law school requirements for business [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  records exception, et cetera. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=392.8s)]
*  I thought the jury was going to be sort of, you know, very bored and even irked. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=394.68s)]
*  They actually seem to be paying attention to this as if it was... [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=399.48s)]
*  Wait, but take me through, I mean, I read the monologue, so I understand the point, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=402.24s)]
*  but like just hammer at home, like you stipulate, you say like, we all know, like here's a campaign [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=406.12s)]
*  tape. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=410.8s)]
*  It's in public records. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=411.8s)]
*  We know this is the real voice of Donald Trump as voted out by C-SPAN. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=412.8s)]
*  It's not just that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=417.08s)]
*  Yeah, that C-SPAN did it in the regular course of business by someone who had the duty to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=418.08s)]
*  do it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=422.2s)]
*  Point being that you don't stipulate when you have to establish a sort of chain of custody [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=423.2s)]
*  of this document and authenticate it with the person who can speak to authority of its [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=426.68s)]
*  authenticity. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=431.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=432.08s)]
*  You have to be able to show it is what it looks like. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=433.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=436.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=437.2s)]
*  And then the banker who seems like basically, he's basically like, Michael Cohen is really [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=438.2s)]
*  rushing and desperate and he doesn't know much about this deal, but is maybe like sniffing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  around it not being great. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=451.32000000000005s)]
*  I think what he's saying to himself is Michael Cohen was always in a rush and real estate [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=453.04s)]
*  transactions are often rushed. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=457.24s)]
*  Like this, yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=458.8s)]
*  So even though there was something a little fuzzy about it, maybe in retrospect and certainly [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=459.8s)]
*  once we knew about Stormy Daniels, while we were going through it, it didn't strike us [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=463.6s)]
*  as out of the ordinary because it was totally in keeping with how Michael Cohen behaved [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=468.04s)]
*  and totally in keeping with how our real estate clients behaved. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=471.88000000000005s)]
*  And Michael Cohen represented to us on paper that he was establishing a real estate consultancy [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  and paying a retainer to a lawyer. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=481.12s)]
*  Hold that thought. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=482.12s)]
*  Hold that thought because you're going to stay right here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=483.12s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  The gag order ruling, how Trump is enjoying his time in the freezing of courthouse eight [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=486.68s)]
*  hours a day. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=491.72s)]
*  That's all next. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=492.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=493.72s)]
*  So today we finally got that long awaited ruling on whether or not Donald Trump violated [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=497.16s)]
*  the gag order in his New York election interference case. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=501.2s)]
*  The prosecutors flagged 10 instances, eight from social media, two from his campaign website, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=504.36s)]
*  that they said ran afoul of the judge's order. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=509.4s)]
*  Most of the posts attack Michael Cohen, citing a New York Post article calling him a serial [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=512.6s)]
*  perjurer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=516.64s)]
*  Others go after adult film star Stormy Daniels and former prosecutor from the DA's office, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=518.16s)]
*  Mark Pomerantz. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=522.04s)]
*  Now this morning, the judge agreed with the prosecution on nine of those 10 instances. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=523.04s)]
*  Judge Marchand finding Donald Trump in contempt of court, ordering him to delete the post [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=527.84s)]
*  by 2 15 this afternoon, which he did. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=532.44s)]
*  Trump has also been ordered to pay a thousand dollars per violation for a total of $9,000 [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=535.32s)]
*  due on Friday. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=539.2s)]
*  And if he does it again, the judge warned that, and I quote him here, the court will [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=544.64s)]
*  appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=549.36s)]
*  And now by LaDoris Cordell, who serves as a judge on the California Superior Court, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=554.8s)]
*  still with me here at the table, Harry Litman and Lisa Rubin. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=558.8399999999999s)]
*  And Harry, you were saying something that I cut you off before we went to break. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=561.4799999999999s)]
*  But do you remember what it was? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  But this was really, you buried the lead just now because this is the first time Trump has [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  heard next time you're going in, because what preceded this was Marchand saying the money [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  just is not effective. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=579.92s)]
*  And really this he has now, you know, raised the hammer and said, next time I'm coming [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=582.0s)]
*  down. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=588.0s)]
*  At least you made the point that the thousand dollar fine, for instance, is statutorily [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=589.0s)]
*  prescribed by New York law. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  Judge Cordell, you were with us here and you have made a point that a lot of people took [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=595.0s)]
*  a lot of notice of. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=599.88s)]
*  And I've heard back from folks who talked about your point that you made here on this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=600.88s)]
*  air that, you know, you can say, look, we are, there is going to be jail time and I'm [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=605.24s)]
*  not going to tell you how much it is or where it is until after the trial so that you try [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  to get this disincentive effect. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you think of the ruling by Judge Marchand today? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=616.0s)]
*  The judge's ruling was totally within his discretion. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=620.16s)]
*  He found nine violations. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=623.48s)]
*  But there's a bit of a dilemma he's created and it's that he has another contempt hearing [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=625.64s)]
*  coming up on Thursday and that's four more alleged violations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=630.56s)]
*  So if the judge finds that all of those were in fact violations of his gag order, I think [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=635.04s)]
*  most people would think, well, then, you know, he's going to send him to jail. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=641.64s)]
*  Well, he really can't because what he said today was that going forward, if there are [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=644.48s)]
*  any more violations, these four preceded it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=650.48s)]
*  So now we'll have maybe 13 or 14 violations, likely with more fines. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=653.56s)]
*  So had the judge had the two contempt here, the violations, put them all together and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=659.32s)]
*  had one hearing, I think we'd have a different situation here where the judge probably would [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=665.24s)]
*  be inclined to say, OK, that's enough. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=670.6s)]
*  You're going in. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=672.72s)]
*  That's a great point and important one because subsequent violations don't count for this [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=673.72s)]
*  hearing Thursday. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=677.7600000000001s)]
*  I just want to just enter into the record here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=678.7600000000001s)]
*  The some of the posts by the defendant in this case, which again, this is all very unusual. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=681.36s)]
*  This really doesn't happen. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  The judge has taken away my constitutional right to free speech. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=689.28s)]
*  I am the only presidential candidate in history to be all caps gagged. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=691.68s)]
*  This whole trial is rigged by taking away my freedom of speech. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=695.04s)]
*  The highly conflicted judge is rigging the presidential of 2024 election, election interference. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  He also said this is a total witch hunt hours of sitting down and listening to nothing except [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  exoneration and lies. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=706.56s)]
*  The trial is going like a speeding bullet because the judge is working hard to make [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=708.12s)]
*  all of his friends happy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=711.28s)]
*  He's rigged, crooked, conflicted, disgraced our country. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=712.48s)]
*  This is today. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=715.8s)]
*  This is today. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=716.92s)]
*  This is today. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=717.92s)]
*  One of the things he says here and we've sort of made this joke before that it's going too [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=719.12s)]
*  fast and too slow. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=722.12s)]
*  Like it's he's sitting there so much, but it's going so fast. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=723.12s)]
*  And two two things to bring up here. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=726.4799999999999s)]
*  One is the thing we discussed in the last block, which is the refusal to stipulate is [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=728.56s)]
*  elongating the trial time. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=733.36s)]
*  Correct? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=735.7199999999999s)]
*  It's hard to see how it couldn't. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=736.7199999999999s)]
*  The fact that you have to bring in the guy who's the head of C-SPAN archives from Indiana [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=737.7199999999999s)]
*  with his counsel to go through the process by which C-SPAN records and keeps video archives [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  of campaign speeches and make the jury sit through that too. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=747.16s)]
*  Imagine how many more times we might have to go through similar things for other videos, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=750.6s)]
*  for example. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=755.48s)]
*  It can't help but elongate the trial. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=756.48s)]
*  And this is a guy who's blaming Alvin Bragg for keeping him off the campaign trail when [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  his lawyers and he have made choices that are keeping him there for longer. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=761.92s)]
*  Not only that, just to follow up, he doesn't appear to be enjoying himself. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=766.6s)]
*  And I can't imagine I would either. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=770.0s)]
*  I don't think this is a strange or character flaw. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=771.0s)]
*  He does a lot of resting of his eyes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=774.48s)]
*  We can't say what's going on. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=776.24s)]
*  This is Long saying the rosary in his head. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a reverie about campaign speeches or he's falling asleep, whatever it is. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=781.62s)]
*  His eyes are closed a lot in that room. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=787.04s)]
*  His eyes are closed a lot. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=788.92s)]
*  And to me, what I will say is he appears to be at rest for considerable periods of time. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  I spend a lot of time with my nose either in my phone or my computer at the courthouse [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=796.84s)]
*  trying to transcribe or capture moments for you and our other colleagues here. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=800.82s)]
*  But every time I looked up today, particularly during the first part of the day, Donald Trump's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=806.46s)]
*  eyes were closed. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=812.0200000000001s)]
*  He could have been meditating. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=813.74s)]
*  He could have been napping. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=815.22s)]
*  That's not for me to say other than I think he appeared to be at rest. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=816.72s)]
*  I brought binoculars. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  R.E.M. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  We're talking about. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=822.0600000000001s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  He was under. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  Judge, let me ask you this question. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  The pacing of the trial so far, I want to get your sense of how you think it's going. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=828.34s)]
*  Obviously, there is the fact that defense won't stipulate to these sort of archival [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=834.26s)]
*  to these records. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=839.0600000000001s)]
*  They have to bring in experts. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=840.14s)]
*  But what do you think about the pacing so far? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=841.14s)]
*  So it's really the job of the judge to make sure the trial is moving along. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=844.86s)]
*  And I know when I was on the bench and I had many jury trials, I was always looking over [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=849.5s)]
*  at the jurors. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=853.5400000000001s)]
*  They're always looking at me too. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=854.5400000000001s)]
*  But to see if they were with us. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=856.0999999999999s)]
*  Basically, I saw some people. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=858.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm nodding out. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=861.3399999999999s)]
*  Then we take a recess. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=862.78s)]
*  So I believe the pace is good. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=864.42s)]
*  These jurors are generally interested in what's going on in the courtroom. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=866.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think it's true basically of all jurors and maybe a few exceptions. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=870.5799999999999s)]
*  They really want to do the work and they are paying attention to what's going on. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=875.38s)]
*  And they know this is this is important. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=881.62s)]
*  So you know, and if I could just say one thing about the fines that President Sean imposed, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=884.16s)]
*  I put out a call to New York legislators. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=890.24s)]
*  They need to amend the statute that punishes criminal contempt in New York. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=893.68s)]
*  It is ridiculous now to have the maximum fine of a thousand dollars per violation. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=898.92s)]
*  It was probably right at the time because I don't think they ever envisioned having [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=904.64s)]
*  somebody really, really wealthy just blatantly ignore the orders of the court. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=909.48s)]
*  So I hope that happens sooner than later. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=914.26s)]
*  On the point of juries, you know, this is a hobby horse of mine. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=917.1s)]
*  But if you'll indulge me to briefly write it, it is the case that people's ability to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=920.02s)]
*  pay attention for long periods of time. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=926.6s)]
*  All sorts of empirical evidence has pointed to that ability shrinking. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=928.66s)]
*  And obviously we understand why that is. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  We have constant stimulus and distraction. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=934.16s)]
*  And even just thinking about, I mean, this is happening every day across courtrooms across [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=936.5s)]
*  America. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=939.78s)]
*  So this is a slice of that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=940.78s)]
*  But the idea of remaining attentive and fixed for this period of time, not looking at your [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=941.9s)]
*  phone, not looking at other things for everyone in that room, it has taken on a level of difficulty [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=948.08s)]
*  or strangeness in the normal course of things that I that I'm curious how you feel like [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=954.66s)]
*  when you check in on the jury, how you think they're doing in that score. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=961.42s)]
*  I actually think they're doing really well. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=964.9s)]
*  They all have, Chris, as you know, an individual monitor in front of them. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=967.9s)]
*  And that certainly helps, particularly when an examination is document intensive because [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=972.02s)]
*  their eyes are fixed on, for example, the individual text between Davidson and Howard [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  or the emails between Davidson and Cohen. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=984.0600000000001s)]
*  They certainly looked really attentively at the bank records that other people might be [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=986.26s)]
*  bored by. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=990.34s)]
*  They are really interested in the details. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=991.34s)]
*  But the technology in the courtroom is assistive to them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=992.86s)]
*  And that way, in helping them stay engaged, they're closer to the players than anybody [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=995.82s)]
*  else. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1000.42s)]
*  And they've got their own personal monitors with the exhibits demonstrated for them. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1001.42s)]
*  So it definitely is in needing the jurors ability to pay attention. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1005.7s)]
*  That having been said, I think this particularly particular jury is especially attentive, more [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1010.98s)]
*  attentive than, for example, the two juries in the E.G. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1016.38s)]
*  and Carroll trials, which who I thought were also fairly attentive. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1019.1s)]
*  I would say it's them somewhat. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1023.38s)]
*  And there are a couple of people in particular. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1025.34s)]
*  It's the best part of being in the courtroom to really focus. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1027.46s)]
*  There are a couple of jurors who you think, if he's got a shot at a hold on me, it's they. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1029.98s)]
*  But they have come in and out. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1034.96s)]
*  And the text we were talking about where he's so apt, you could see their attention come [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1036.42s)]
*  forward. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1043.54s)]
*  But it's waned, I think, even in the days that I've been there. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1044.54s)]
*  They're pretty good, but they're not at the edge of their chairs. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1047.9s)]
*  There's much fewer, much less note taken than there was. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1051.5400000000002s)]
*  Judge Ladores, Cordell, Harry Libman and Lisa Rubin, great to have you all. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1054.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  Also, you can get much more insight into what's been happening in the courtroom during this [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1059.5800000000002s)]
*  trial in the latest episode of my podcast, Why is this Happening with Lisa Rubin. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1063.8600000000001s)]
*  We got to talk about the trial. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1068.5s)]
*  It was great. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1070.02s)]
*  It is available wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1071.02s)]
*  So check it out. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6LtXHqVGyw&t=1073.26s)]
