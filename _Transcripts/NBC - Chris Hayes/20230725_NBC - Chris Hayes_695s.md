# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 24
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y)
*  And today, Andrew Weissman, lead prosecutor and special counsel Robert Mueller's office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  tweeted this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=4.72s)]
*  It seems like a distinct possibility that we will learn today that the Trump defense [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=5.72s)]
*  team has presented appeal to the Department of Justice regarding the January 6th charges. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=10.36s)]
*  And then, upon the rejection of that appeal, Jack Smith will seek the indictment tomorrow [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=16.16s)]
*  or Thursday at the latest in D.C. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=20.12s)]
*  Andrew Weissman is also the co-host of the podcast, Prosecuting Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=23.52s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=27.64s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=28.64s)]
*  So Andrew, first of all, I have to ask you about that tweet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=30.72s)]
*  Is there anything you've learned since you tweeted that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=33.32s)]
*  Any new news you have to share with us? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=38.04s)]
*  But let me tell you about why I tweeted that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=39.04s)]
*  So we know that the grand jury sits on Tuesdays and Thursdays in D.C. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=41.44s)]
*  And the case is going to be brought in D.C. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  So for people who are concerned that it might be in Florida again, that's not going to happen [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=48.8s)]
*  because the gravamen of the case is there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=52.72s)]
*  There's cameras all over the place in D.C. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  And you're watching. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=57.64s)]
*  Looking for the courthouse. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=58.64s)]
*  I've been on the other side of that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=59.64s)]
*  So I know how that feels. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=60.64s)]
*  And then the other thing is that before a case is actually indicted, the defense will [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=62.52s)]
*  have an opportunity to be heard by both Jack Smith and by people at Maine, what's called [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=67.92s)]
*  Maine Justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=74.36s)]
*  And so that's really what I've been waiting for is that piece because once we have that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=75.78s)]
*  piece, it's going to go forward. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=79.44s)]
*  So could it be happening and we just don't know about it? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=80.8s)]
*  Is it typically very quiet? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=83.32s)]
*  It could be because this is one where it could be on it could be on the phone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=85.44s)]
*  It could be by Zoom. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=88.76s)]
*  It could be we've seen it in person. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=89.72s)]
*  So it could be any of those things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=92.24s)]
*  So it is possible that it's quiet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=93.72s)]
*  As you know, when things happen in Washington, it's hard to keep things quiet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=96.08s)]
*  So I thought we might get some some word on that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=99.84s)]
*  But we haven't so far. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=103.04s)]
*  There's just a few reporters assigned to break news on this case out there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=103.84s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you about Bernie Kerik. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=107.68s)]
*  And first, I just want to start because I can't figure this out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=110.0s)]
*  Why Trump waived executive attorney client privilege here in this case? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=112.84s)]
*  What would have motivated him to do that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=118.68s)]
*  Yeah. So so for you, Bernie Kerik is very close to Rudy Giuliani. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=120.08s)]
*  He served as his chief investigator and Rudy Giuliani was looking at whether there was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  fraud in the election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=129.84s)]
*  Bernie Kerik is also a felon and he was pardoned by Donald Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=131.32s)]
*  So that's his history. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=135.16s)]
*  So on the issue of why he would waive, it's important. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=137.16s)]
*  This is like going to be super in the weeds. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=142.08s)]
*  But here we go. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=144.0s)]
*  So there are two types of privilege. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=146.28s)]
*  There's attorney client privilege and then there's something called work product. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=147.84s)]
*  Attorney client is very sacrosanct. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=151.8s)]
*  That's very hard to pierce. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  We've seen an example where there's crime fraud, where it's pierced work product. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  Much easier for the government to get at it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=160.56s)]
*  It's a work product that was waived. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=163.52s)]
*  And that's one where I think this is a little bit snow in winter because although now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  nowadays that's actually something. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=171.04s)]
*  But you know, when it used to be there was a lot of snow in winter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=172.64s)]
*  That's one where I think Jack Smith would have been able to get that information anyway. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=176.48s)]
*  So it's not much of a give there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=180.28s)]
*  So don't over read into that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  OK, so Jack Smith, what is he looking to gain from all of these documents? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=184.04s)]
*  And Bernie Kerik coming to see his team in two weeks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=188.48s)]
*  So you know how we've heard that there were all sorts of people who told the former president [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=191.84s)]
*  that he lost. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=197.12s)]
*  We've heard that he learned that from campaign people, from communications people, from people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=198.24s)]
*  chief of staff was joking about the lack of voter fraud. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=206.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=207.96s)]
*  So if you have Rudy Giuliani and his chief investigator who are supposed to be looking [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=208.96s)]
*  for fraud, getting access to what they came up with is useful. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=213.16s)]
*  So if they came up with nothing, that is a really useful fact. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  If you're trying to show that Donald Trump had no good faith belief that his mens rea [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=221.72s)]
*  was malignant, that it was it actually fits the criminal statute. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=227.12s)]
*  And we have reason to think that that is exactly what these documents will show, because we [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=231.48s)]
*  have a little window in the Rudy Giuliani disbarment proceedings. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=235.44s)]
*  You really can't make this up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=240.32s)]
*  But it's like, but in the movie. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=241.32s)]
*  This is a movie. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=243.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=244.0s)]
*  So in the Rudy Giuliani disbarment proceedings, not in New York, but in D.C., because he's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=245.0s)]
*  facing not one, but two disbarment proceedings there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=249.2s)]
*  They had Bernie Kerrick documents. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  And what they said about them is they had no probative value. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=256.24s)]
*  They looked at them and said there was nothing there at all. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=261.24s)]
*  So when a human non-legal speaks, does that mean these 2000 documents? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=264.52s)]
*  I don't speak non-human. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=268.52s)]
*  Well, I'm working with you here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=269.52s)]
*  I'm luring you out of the legal hole. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=271.96s)]
*  It means that these 2000 documents, what they're looking for is that there might be no evidence [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=274.24s)]
*  at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=278.44s)]
*  And we don't expect there to be voter fraud. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=279.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=280.8s)]
*  They're looking to see if there's nothing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=281.92s)]
*  And obviously, if there is something there, if you're a prosecutor, you want to know that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=283.36s)]
*  So either way, it's something they want to know. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=286.76s)]
*  Now these Mark Meadows text messages, of which there are many, and I just had one example [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=288.92s)]
*  there, what makes clear he does not buy this notion of voter fraud. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=296.2s)]
*  What do you, I mean, how problematic is this for Mark Meadows? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=301.6s)]
*  Is he in legal trouble here? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=305.12s)]
*  Or OK, how serious is his legal trouble? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=306.8s)]
*  Obviously, from one document, that's not enough to build a whole criminal case. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=310.68s)]
*  But he was in a lot of meetings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  And the reason that is a document that everyone's focusing on is he, for instance, was on the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=318.42s)]
*  calls to Georgia saying there's fraud in the election. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, if he is having these private messages, including with his own son saying the fraud [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  that we've seen is like one or two people, that's not fraud to change the results of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=335.44s)]
*  the election. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=340.04s)]
*  That's not the 11,000 votes that you need. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=341.04s)]
*  So that is a very... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=344.04s)]
*  There was even a joke about finding 10,000 additional votes with the White House lawyer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=345.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=348.76s)]
*  So that is, you know, if you are, just imagine, if you're a prosecutor, you're thinking good [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=349.76s)]
*  luck with the jury. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=352.88s)]
*  You know, they're going to look at this and say you knew exactly that you were misleading [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=353.88s)]
*  the state legislature here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=359.4s)]
*  And how does Jack Smith, and we don't know what's in all of the documents, but how does [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=361.0s)]
*  Jack Smith use those text messages or Mark Meadows joking about this on a Trump case? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=364.76s)]
*  So obviously if Mark Meadows is a defendant, if he is charged, those are what's called [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  an admission, it's a direct admission. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=377.32s)]
*  It could also come in under the rules of evidence as a state, what's called a statement against [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=380.44s)]
*  interest, and potentially also as a co-conspirator statement. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  So there are a lot of different theories, but you're right to flag that because some [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=388.68s)]
*  of the things that might be very damaging as to one defendant don't always come in as [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=392.32s)]
*  to every defendant. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=396.48s)]
*  That's, by the way, this, I have a feeling we'll be talking about this more as the case [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=397.48s)]
*  goes forward. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=401.2s)]
*  I have a feeling we will. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=402.2s)]
*  Andrew Weissman, I could take your law class. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=403.64s)]
*  I'm waiting for a new podcast episode. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=405.52s)]
*  I've been waiting for days now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=407.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=409.36s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  Just as there is no real precedent for Donald Trump's attempted coup in American history, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  there's also no real precedent for an ex-president facing multiple criminal indictments while [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=418.88s)]
*  he is seeking a second term in the White House. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=425.32s)]
*  To me, it seems pretty obvious that the other 2024 Republican candidates might want to jump [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=427.84s)]
*  on these charges. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  You'd think that some of his opponents would want to try and maybe land a punch or two [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=435.84s)]
*  or five on the front runner, or maybe they would want to speak up simply because it's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  the right thing to do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=445.4s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=446.88s)]
*  Since when has standing up for American democracy been a partisan thing anyway? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=448.12s)]
*  Never really has been before the last couple of years. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=451.8s)]
*  But Trump's opponents clearly do not see it that way. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's what the guy who Trump's armed mob wanted to hang on January 6th had to say just [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=458.68s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=463.8s)]
*  The president's words were reckless that day. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=465.56s)]
*  I had no right to overturn the election. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=467.56s)]
*  But while his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  were criminal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  I really do hope it doesn't come to that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=477.28s)]
*  And also for the reason that I do think the Department of Justice has lost the confidence [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=480.44s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=486.4s)]
*  Again, I mean, it's worth restating that this is the guy that Trump's mob wanted to hang. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  And all he could muster was that it was reckless. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  So okay, what about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the guy who most political strategists still [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=498.08s)]
*  Maybe, maybe there's a chance, a path of him taking out Trump. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=504.2s)]
*  What did he have to say? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=509.4s)]
*  four years ago in January. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=513.6s)]
*  And so I want to focus on looking forward. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=516.28s)]
*  I don't want to look back. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=518.56s)]
*  I do not want to see him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=519.6s)]
*  I hope he doesn't get charged. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=520.92s)]
*  I don't think it'll be good for the country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=522.12s)]
*  I love how he vaguely references what happened four years ago in January as if it was like [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=524.72s)]
*  a dinner date or something. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=529.56s)]
*  You know what's bad for the country, Governor DeSantis? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=531.48s)]
*  When Republicans refused to call out the actions of someone who tried to overturn a Democratic [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=533.56s)]
*  election. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=537.68s)]
*  Maybe South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, the supposed middle of the road guy who's worked [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  with Democrats before. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=543.36s)]
*  Maybe maybe he'll criticize Trump's attempted coup. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=544.88s)]
*  I hold the folks who broke into the Capitol with ill will in their hearts, destroying [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=548.6s)]
*  property responsible for their actions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=554.16s)]
*  I don't hold the former president who didn't show up at the Capitol and threatened my life [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=556.8s)]
*  as responsible. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=561.6s)]
*  So it seems that nearly all of the serious contenders to take on Trump have basically [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=563.48s)]
*  made the political calculation that it's better to stand by him in the primary. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=569.28s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=574.0s)]
*  It is not working. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=575.52s)]
*  Mike Pence might not even make the debate stage. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=577.16s)]
*  DeSantis is still running 30 points behind in Iowa, despite betting big, according to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=580.08s)]
*  his aides on the Hawkeye state. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=584.64s)]
*  And right now, Tim Scott is losing his own state of South Carolina by nearly 40 points. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=586.8s)]
*  To be fair, it's not exactly working to attack Trump so far either. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=594.88s)]
*  I mean, the never Trump candidates like Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson are polling in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=598.0s)]
*  the single digits. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, behind most of these Trump apologists. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=604.0s)]
*  It may be that the electorate is too locked into Trump at this point. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=607.4s)]
*  And we do have several months to go. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  But at least Hutchinson and Christie have clearly made the calculation that they won't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=613.08s)]
*  be remembered as enablers by the history books. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=617.96s)]
*  That's worth something. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=620.4000000000001s)]
*  The rest of the field, though, is in a position where they are effectively enabling a guy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  who led an attempted coup. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  And for what? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  To maybe win a handful of delegates? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=629.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm like seriously asking you this. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=630.72s)]
*  What are they trying to get out of this? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=633.44s)]
*  Does Nikki Haley want to be the vice president that badly? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  Is Tim Scott hoping to be made secretary of commerce? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=641.08s)]
*  Ron DeSantis just started his second term as governor. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=642.08s)]
*  Don't even get me started on Mike Pence. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=644.72s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea what he wants out of this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=646.9200000000001s)]
*  So what is the overall end game here for all of these guys? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=650.48s)]
*  And Nikki Haley, of course, because right now they are all on track to be a footnote [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=653.84s)]
*  in the history books. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=658.64s)]
*  An asterisk in the also ran category may be an answer on Jeopardy on a good day. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=659.98s)]
*  Nobody remembers the guy who got 2% in Iowa and dropped out shortly after. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  But they will remember the folks who put politics over country and refuse to stand [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=668.76s)]
*  up for our democracy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wy9WieR4Y&t=673.0s)]
