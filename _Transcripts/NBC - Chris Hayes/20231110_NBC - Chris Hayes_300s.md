# ‘Unfathomably reckless:’ Hayes on the targeting of journalists amid Israel-Hamas war
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE)
*  At least 40 journalists have been killed since the Hamas attacks on October 7th and the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=0.0s)]
*  campaign in response, 35 in Gaza alone during that Israeli response. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=4.68s)]
*  It's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which notes, this is the highest [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=9.96s)]
*  total of any recent conflict. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=14.8s)]
*  It led to, quote, the deadliest month for journalists since they began gathering data [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  in 1992. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Last week, one Palestinian reporter broke down as he learned of the loss of his colleague [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=23.44s)]
*  live on the air. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=28.6s)]
*  Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world to be a journalist right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=58.6s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=63.4s)]
*  And since no foreign journalists are allowed in, unless they are embedded with the Israeli [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=64.8s)]
*  army, these local journalists, often employed as freelancers by Western media, are the eyes [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=68.2s)]
*  and ears of the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=73.12s)]
*  So it's incredibly distressing when an Israeli group called Honest Reporting circulated the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=75.28s)]
*  names and at least one case pictures of local Palestinian journalists who documented the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=78.84s)]
*  Hamas attack and all but outright accused them of having foreign knowledge of the attack [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=83.34s)]
*  itself and being collaborators in it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=87.56s)]
*  Those accusations were amplified and spread all over social media. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Some outlets like CNN chose to cut ties with one of the freelancers after Honest Reporting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  surfaced an old photo of him with Hamas' leader, though we don't know the context. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Others, like the New York Times, whose freelance contributor was targeted, issued a strong [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=103.12s)]
*  rebuke, quote, the accusation that any one of the New York Times had advanced knowledge [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  of the Hamas attacks or accompanied Hamas terrorists during the attacks is untrue and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=111.4s)]
*  outrageous. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=115.84s)]
*  It is reckless to make such allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=117.24s)]
*  Gaza at risk. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=121.08s)]
*  We also want to speak in defense of freelance photojournalists working in conflict areas [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  whose jobs often require them to rush into danger to provide firsthand witness accounts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  and to document important news. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=131.4s)]
*  This is the essential role of a free press in wartime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  But since that implication, several prominent Israeli politicians warned that journalists [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  who knew about the attack would be treated like terrorists that is targeted for violence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=141.8s)]
*  Those voices include War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=146.52s)]
*  Even Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas jumped in on the whole thing, writing a letter [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  to the New York Times with a veiled thread about employees of the newspaper facing criminal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  prosecution, citing those reports that their journalists were embedded with Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=157.52s)]
*  And then last night, through the Associated Press, we learned that Honest Reporting, the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  group making these claims, quote, had no evidence to back it up, the suggestion that any of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  the journalists were. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=172.28s)]
*  It implied Hamas collaborators had any foreknowledge of the attacks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=173.48s)]
*  In the context of the worst death toll of working reporters I've seen in my life, this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=178.32s)]
*  is unfathomably reckless from everyone involved. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=182.2s)]
*  The reason war reporting is so crucially important is because, as the old cliche goes, truth [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=186.64s)]
*  is the first casualty of war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  In the era of social media, this takes on new meaning as we are subjected to an endless [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  stream of images and information and propaganda. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=198.44s)]
*  Take one notable example. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=202.28s)]
*  Hamas leadership in interview after interview was either gamely tried to deny their own [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=203.28s)]
*  atrocities on October 7th or seeded false stories. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=207.84s)]
*  The head of Hezbollah recently gave a speech where he claimed that it was Israeli soldiers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=211.72s)]
*  who killed their own citizens, that they were the ones really responsible for what happened. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=216.0s)]
*  That and other conspiracy theories have now predictably blossomed online with all the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=221.58s)]
*  attendant grainy video and the like. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=225.16s)]
*  But the atrocities committed by Hamas are undeniable, not just because of the eyewitness [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=228.16s)]
*  accounts to them, but also because Hamas made sure that seemingly everyone committing the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  atrocity recorded it for posterity. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  Though there will be those who dispute the slaughter, the slaughter is not in dispute. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=239.54s)]
*  There will be those who dispute the abject misery and death of Gaza's people, but that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=244.48s)]
*  is not in dispute. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=248.66s)]
*  In fact, earlier this week, a senior Biden administration official said the death toll [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=250.94s)]
*  of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is likely far higher than the 10,000 being reported [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=254.5s)]
*  by the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=259.98s)]
*  Journalism at its best makes us reckon with terrible truths, and among the many, many, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  many lies worthy of mourning in this war, I want to honor those fellow members of our [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=268.3s)]
*  profession who have paid the ultimate price while bearing witness for all of us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkqso0kcjE&t=273.86s)]
