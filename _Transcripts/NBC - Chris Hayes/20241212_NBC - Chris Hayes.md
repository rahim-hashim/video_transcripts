# Trump’s energy secretary pick once drank bleach to defend fracking
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c)
*  There were some issues in the election where the choice between the candidates couldn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=0.0s)]
*  have been more stark. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=3.44s)]
*  One of those, I think, is the issue of climate and the green economy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=4.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party, led by the Biden administration and its unprecedented focus on the issue, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=7.76s)]
*  ran on passing the largest climate spending bill in history, opened the door to trillions [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=12.88s)]
*  in public and private dollars going towards new green investments. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=18.12s)]
*  On the other side, of course, Donald Trump railed against electric cars. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=22.68s)]
*  He claimed windmills cause cancer, which is one of his favorites. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=25.64s)]
*  He's really psyched about drill baby drill, although the Biden administration set records [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=28.64s)]
*  for oil exports. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=33.6s)]
*  Now he has tapped someone who embodies his pro-fossil fuel position to be his secretary [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=36.0s)]
*  of energy, Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=40.0s)]
*  Wright's a staunch defender of fossil fuels. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=43.68s)]
*  He said that greenhouse emissions targets are perverse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=45.44s)]
*  He's attacked wind and solar subsidies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=49.2s)]
*  And in a gimmick to defend fracking, he once drank fracking fluid, a mix of water, bleach [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  soap and other substances. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  If confirmed, he'll be taking over a department that has been remade under the Biden administration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=59.16s)]
*  to become a clean energy powerhouse. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=63.96s)]
*  I'm joined now by the person who spearheaded that shift, the current secretary of the Department [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=65.76s)]
*  of Energy, Jennifer Granholm. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=69.92s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=71.28s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=72.28s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=73.28s)]
*  I want to start on that because the Department of Energy is a strange entity in many ways. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=74.28s)]
*  It sort of started as the caretaker for the U.S. nuclear system, basically. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=77.28s)]
*  And it's got these huge research labs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=84.32s)]
*  But it has been the Biden administration and you and the Inflation Reduction Act to sort [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=86.12s)]
*  of make it a kind of research deployment arm for green energy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=91.2s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  We reorganized the department to add a whole new emphasis on deploy, deploy, deploy is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  what we say inside the department. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=105.56s)]
*  And so while we have preserved the legacy nuclear mission, the Manhattan Project and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=107.78s)]
*  the NNSA, which is the Nuclear Security Administration. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=115.2s)]
*  So there's a component that's attached, a very big component attached to the defense [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  system, defense industry. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  But we are really focused on getting out across the country clean energy and manufacturing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  of the products that will get us to that clean energy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=131.46s)]
*  And Chris, I can just tell you, it has been amazing how policy has worked because as of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=134.12s)]
*  today, there are 950 factories that have come to the United States or expanded in the United [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=140.48s)]
*  States because of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is, you're talking to the former [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=148.84s)]
*  governor of Michigan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=154.1s)]
*  We were at a time when we were spiraling, losing so many jobs, the industrial Midwest, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=155.1s)]
*  as you know. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=160.04s)]
*  950, that's so far. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=161.04s)]
*  And the act is only a couple of years old. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=163.6s)]
*  It is just an incredible boon for resurging manufacturing across America to make these [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=165.68s)]
*  products. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  We should note that the geopolitics of this, domestically are fascinating. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  Republican leaning states are attracting most of the clean energy investments spurred by [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=180.36s)]
*  the Biden administration's Signature Inflation Reduction Act, that's the Wall Street Journal, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  in New York Times. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=187.68s)]
*  Eighty five percent of the announced investments from the bill have come in Republican districts, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=188.68s)]
*  according to data from August. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=193.88s)]
*  I've done podcasts on this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=196.72s)]
*  They're really, I don't know if it was partly happy accident, partly intentional to make [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=198.28s)]
*  sure this money flowed to the places that might be the most skeptical of the green economy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  There wasn't an intention about it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=207.06s)]
*  A lot of that is because of tax credits, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=208.88s)]
*  And so we do grants and tax credits are also a part of that, as well as loans. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=211.12s)]
*  But honestly, you know, the companies make the choice. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=216.12s)]
*  This is private sector led, government enabled. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=219.26s)]
*  And so they've made the choices of where to go. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  But because of that 85 percent, it would be political now practice to undo the exact thing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=225.16s)]
*  that has created jobs in those districts. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=232.36s)]
*  Well, I want to talk about the politics of this in two directions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=234.56s)]
*  So one of them is I want to talk about the going forward, but one sort of retroactively. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=237.4s)]
*  I mean, it does seem to me like I covered this a lot. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=243.08s)]
*  I've had you on the program. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=246.8s)]
*  I've done multiple podcasts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=247.8s)]
*  No, thank you so much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=248.8s)]
*  This is something I'm really and it really is people that know this policy area are like [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  there is something that's never happened here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=253.84s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=256.6s)]
*  The American public just didn't really know about it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=257.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  Seem to care much one way or the other. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't even think when you run the numbers, if the districts that got the investment are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=264.76s)]
*  going to have had any political effect whatsoever. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Like, what do you make of that? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Because so the law is only two years old. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=273.76s)]
*  We have all these announcements. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=276.12s)]
*  We have a number of groundbreakings. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=277.82s)]
*  We've got fewer ribbon cuttings because it takes some time for the buildings to be built, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=280.78s)]
*  the steel to be in the ground. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=285.5s)]
*  The thing is, you know, Donald Trump is going to walk in and be able to take credit for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=287.06s)]
*  all of these factories actually appearing, even though they happened under the Inflation [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  Reduction Act passed by Joe Biden. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=295.86s)]
*  OK, so that then brings us to the second question. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=297.42s)]
*  I mean, I think people hear that and they make me tear their hair out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=299.62s)]
*  But it means that there's durability. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=303.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  The other question is, I don't care so much about that as much as I care about us continuing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=305.66s)]
*  to move towards a green economy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=309.94s)]
*  You think that the nature of that, the fact that he can take credit for it and that all [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=312.54s)]
*  these Republican districts are seeing this money, which is still going to keep going [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  for 10 years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=320.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=321.54s)]
*  I mean, Congress... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=322.54s)]
*  You think they're not going to repeal it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=323.54s)]
*  Well, look, Congress is so close, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=324.54s)]
*  In the House, there were 18 House Republicans who sent a letter saying, please do not repeal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=325.54s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act, the portions, because their districts were benefiting from [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  all of the investment that's going there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  We've had so far just half a trillion dollars worth of investment in these, you know, whether [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=335.7s)]
*  it's batteries for electric vehicles or the vehicles themselves or wind or solar. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=340.3s)]
*  When you think of in Dalton, Georgia, the Q cells, they're going to be hiring 4,500 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=343.94s)]
*  people to build solar panels in the United States. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=350.18s)]
*  You know, a product that historically had been in China. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=353.22s)]
*  All the Republicans have continued to talk about critical minerals and bringing back [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=356.7s)]
*  supply chains. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=360.26s)]
*  That's exactly what this act is doing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=361.26s)]
*  The critical minerals, 950 factories, is all part of the supply chains. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=363.3s)]
*  You have to have an anode, a cathode separator material, electrolyte for a battery, for an [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  electric vehicle. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  All of that stuff's coming back, the critical minerals. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  We are bringing that back from China. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=374.66s)]
*  That's what's so exciting about what is happening in the country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=377.22s)]
*  So there are bipartisan OASIS of support for bringing back critical minerals, for nuclear [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=380.82000000000005s)]
*  power, for clean hydrogen, for geothermal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=388.98s)]
*  I mean, there's all sorts of areas where we can get consensus, including nuclear. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=395.18s)]
*  I mean, yes, definitely nuclear. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, usually the political logic is that no one says no to free money, but not always. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=401.06s)]
*  I mean, I watched this happen with Medicaid expansion, as you recall, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=405.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the idea was, and it wasn't free money. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=408.26s)]
*  There was a match, but in the beginning it was free. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=410.06s)]
*  And a bunch of states were like, we don't want it, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  Cut off your note to spite your face. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=416.42s)]
*  I guess that's going to be a real question here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=419.26s)]

*  Every governor wants to create industries of the future so that people are not moving [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=429.26s)]
*  away. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=432.65999999999997s)]

*  Right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=445.46s)]
*  So it's happening. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=446.46s)]
*  And they just want to see this and they want to help their citizens at least get heat pumps [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=448.14s)]

*  You know, this was the largest climate investment in American history. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=453.62s)]
*  In the world. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=458.3s)]

*  Right. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  We need more to get there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  Scale one to 10, how are you feeling about the future given the fact that this guy who [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  says it's all about this? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=473.62s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=474.62s)]

*  I am optimistic that we, that this is inexorable, that it is inevitable that this transition [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=476.62s)]
*  will continue because, yes, the red districts, because of the bipartisan support for these [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=482.58s)]
*  technologies, but also because states and local governments and the private sector are [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=488.94s)]
*  moving forward on this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=493.54s)]

*  Also, the price is coming down around the world. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  The story in Pakistan where people are basically just jerry-rigging their solar panels and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=498.02s)]
*  sidestepping the grid. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBEDyQgA3c&t=501.78000000000003s)]
