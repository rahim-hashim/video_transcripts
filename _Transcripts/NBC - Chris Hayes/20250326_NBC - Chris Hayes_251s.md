# ‘Flatly authoritarian’: New video shows masked agents arresting Tufts student
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA)
*  A lot of focus on the major scandals that we're seeing every day and actually too many [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=0.0s)]
*  to name or totally get your arms around. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  But it's also important to stay aware of what is happening out in our country where we're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=7.34s)]
*  seeing the Trump administration almost every week snatch people right off the streets for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=10.76s)]
*  political speech. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=18.12s)]
*  The latest most chilling example happened yesterday outside Boston when a PhD student [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=20.28s)]
*  and Fulbright scholar at Tufts University in this country on a student visa from Turkey, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=24.8s)]
*  totally legal obviously, was taken off a residential street in Summerville, Massachusetts at 5.15 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=29.12s)]
*  p.m. yesterday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=35.88s)]
*  Hermesa Ozterk had just left her apartment when she's approached by a guy in a dark hoodie [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=36.88s)]
*  and hat who then grabs her hands. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  You can see and hear how upset and scared she is as an officer finally pulls out a badge [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=44.6s)]
*  and appears to identify himself as law enforcement. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  She is quickly surrounded by half a dozen, I guess, cops all in street clothes covering [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=54.46s)]
*  their faces with masks. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=60.96s)]
*  They take her cell phone. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=63.72s)]
*  They physically remove her backpack. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=65.3s)]
*  She is then handcuffed as a bystander films and asks how anyone is supposed to know these [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=67.76s)]
*  people are police. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=72.94s)]
*  Covering your faces. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=75.86s)]
*  You want to take those masks off? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=77.36s)]
*  Is this a kidnapping? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=82.68s)]
*  Yeah you don't look like it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=98.56s)]
*  Why are you hiding your faces? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=99.84s)]
*  The mass police lead the terrified woman to their unmarked vehicles and drive off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  Now if all that were not chilling enough, an attorney for Ozterk released a statement [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=110.94s)]
*  earlier today saying in part, we are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=114.06s)]
*  to contact her. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=118.14s)]
*  No charges have been filed against her to date that we are aware of. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=119.62s)]
*  Last night, a district court judge ordered that the young woman not be moved out of Massachusetts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=123.5s)]
*  without first providing advance notice. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=128.26s)]
*  And then late this afternoon, we finally got an idea of where she is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  According to the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Detainee Locator, she is currently [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=135.12s)]
*  being held in the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=139.24s)]
*  That's nearly 2,000 miles from where she was snatched off the street just 27 hours ago. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=143.32s)]
*  Today the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that investigations found [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=149.32s)]
*  Ozterk engaged in activities in support of Hamas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=152.68s)]
*  But again, she's not charged with any crime. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=156.96s)]
*  The activities she is accused of seem to be that she co-wrote an editorial in the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=159.48s)]
*  Tufts School newspaper that was published a year ago today, writing, quote, we affirm [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=164.61999999999998s)]
*  the equal dignity and humanity of all people, specifically referencing Palestinians, going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=170.66s)]
*  on to quote the author James Baldwin and challenging the university president to, quote, acknowledge [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=176.26s)]
*  the Palestinian genocide and embrace efforts by students to evaluate diverse and sometimes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=180.82s)]
*  contradictory ideas and opinions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Tonight, in response to her detention, more than 1,000 people at snap notice showed up [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=189.34s)]
*  in Somerville to protest and call for her return. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  Ramesa Ozterk is not charged with a crime because she did not commit a crime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=198.62s)]
*  She's here on a visa and the government does have the discretion to terminate a visa. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  But is this how America does that now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=209.2s)]
*  A terrified young student snatched off the street by masked police force taken thousands [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  of miles across the country without anyone knowing? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=218.48s)]
*  It is as flatly authoritarian as anything we have seen in this country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtTLu7CDOJA&t=221.84s)]
