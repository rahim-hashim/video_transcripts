Video Description: “’What happened to Rudy?’ You hear that a lot. Well if you take a closer look, there is a case to be made that Rudy has actually been this version of Rudy the whole time,” says Chris Hayes, following Giuliani’s indictment on RICO charges in the Trump election case in Georgia.

# Chris Hayes: This is who Rudy Giuliani has been all along
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants in that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Rico indictment must turn themselves in at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=5.0s)]
*  within nine days. And there they will be booked, processed and have mug shots taken ahead of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=10.32s)]
*  their arraignments, which District Attorney Fonny Willis wants to take place the first [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=16.04s)]
*  week of September. Today, Willis also proposed a trial date for this case about the efforts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=21.04s)]
*  to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere. She requests it begin on March [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=27.14s)]
*  4th of next year. That is the day before Super Tuesday. Now, of course, there's one name [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=32.9s)]
*  that stands out above all the others in this sweeping indictment. It's listed first, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=39.22s)]
*  Donald Trump. But the second most well-known name here is, of course, Rudolph William [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=42.7s)]
*  Lewis Giuliani. And we've been expecting this for quite some time. We've been expecting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=47.82s)]
*  to see Rudy Giuliani's name on this indictment ever since prosecutors in Willis's office [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=52.22s)]
*  informed Giuliani he was a target of the investigation about a year ago. But it is still [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=58.58s)]
*  a remarkable fall from grace for a man who was once a pretty widely renowned public figure. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=65.14s)]
*  Giuliani rose to national prominence as the star United States attorney for the Southern [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=72.18s)]
*  District of New York, a job he held from 1983 to 1989. There, he oversaw the prosecutions [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  of members of the mob, drug dealers, corrupt government officials, earned a tough on crime [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  reputation, which he used to launch his political career. After Giuliani became mayor of New [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=88.78s)]
*  York in 1993, he astutely cultivated the image as the man single-handedly responsible, just [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  him, for cleaning up the city and bringing law and order. Then in the wake of September [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=101.14s)]
*  11th, he was America's mayor. Rudy was even an early front runner for the Republican presidential [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=106.7s)]
*  nomination in 2008, though that didn't go that well. And now here, in the year 2023, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=112.26s)]
*  at 79 years old, Rudy Giuliani has been indicted for his role in what prosecutors call a criminal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=118.06s)]
*  enterprise. He's an alleged racketeer, the one-time future president, a disgraced laughing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=123.86s)]
*  stock. In recent years, he's been best known for a series of half-comical, half-villainous [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=132.74s)]
*  escapades, like presenting ludicrous claims of voter fraud in front of the Four Seasons [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=137.9s)]
*  Total Landscaping, and at another press conference a few weeks later with hair dye trickling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=143.02s)]
*  down his sweat-streaked face. His awful and almost unreadable conversations with the subordinate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  are all over the internet amid a really unsettling sexual harassment lawsuit. He's even a punchline [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=154.86s)]
*  in a Borat movie in the final chapter of his life. Rudy Giuliani is the object of ridicule [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=161.38000000000002s)]
*  and scorn. He is reputationally and financially near bankruptcy. He is looking at the possibility [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=168.02s)]
*  of living out the rest of his days on this earth in prison. How did it happen? How did [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  the once clean as a whistle crimefighter, the law and order man, America's mayor who [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  led us through one of our darkest hours, how did he end up like this? What happened to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=186.94s)]
*  Rudy? You hear that a lot. I would submit, if you take a closer look, there's a case [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=191.98s)]
*  to be made. Rudy has actually been this version of Rudy the whole time, or at least had it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=198.34s)]
*  in him. I mean, in fact, Rudy himself made a pretty revealing statement to that effect [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=205.46s)]
*  last night when he emerged from his shame bunker to address the indictment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=209.94s)]
*  This is a ridiculous application of the racketeering statute. There's probably no one that knows [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  it better than I do. Probably some that know it as well. I was the first one to use it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=221.02s)]
*  in White Collegate. But in major cases like the Bosque case and the Milken case, this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=225.42s)]
*  is not meant for election disputes. I mean, this is ridiculous what she's doing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=231.86s)]
*  Now, credit to Rudy. Rudy is correct. He really did pioneer the use of racketeering laws, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=238.86s)]
*  often shorthanded as RICO. To go after white collar criminals, it was a sort of innovation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  of his, like Michael Milken, as he mentioned in that interview. He brought RICO charges [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  against the mob, the five families in New York, helping to bring down organized crime [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=253.66s)]
*  in New York. According to new reporting from the messenger, wise guys are rejoicing in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=258.38s)]
*  the wake of Giuliani's own RICO indictment. A veteran mob lawyer says his clients are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  effing thrilled. Giuliani also used the RICO laws to go after corruption in politics. One [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=268.94s)]
*  of the ways that he kickstarted his own electoral career in the city of New York was turning [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=275.42s)]
*  his office, the U.S. Attorney's office, attention to the democratic political machine of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=281.82s)]
*  city, which he was, of course, going to run against in the race for mayor. In 1986, he [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=287.26s)]
*  took down Stanley Friedman on racketeering charges. That was a Democrat from the Bronx, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=293.42s)]
*  one of New York's most powerful political figures, as the New York Times put it at the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=297.74s)]
*  time. And by his own admission, Rudy used RICO laws against his political enemies, including [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  the man whose job he wanted, Democratic Mayor Ed Koch. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  The RICO statute, I was the first one to use the racketeering statute for public corruption. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=312.54s)]
*  I did it against most of Ed Koch's administration. Well, it wasn't public corruption. It was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  paying attention. Well, they was stealing millions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=327.74s)]
*  Now think about this. The U.S. attorney who clearly wants political office in the city [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=331.54s)]
*  prosecuting the opposing party, right, using the power to do that. You might uncharitably [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=335.26s)]
*  call that weaponizing the Justice Department for partisan political lands. Now, Giuliani [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=341.3s)]
*  lost his first race for mayor in New York, but he succeeded the second time around after [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  embracing some of the ugliest, most demagogic racist politics that Donald Trump would later [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=351.18s)]
*  mind to great effect. In September of 1992, he rather infamously appeared at a police [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  rally that turned into an all out riot, and he refused to ever decry or denounce it. As [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  mayor, Giuliani oversaw an incredible increase in the surveillance and policing of black [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=369.06s)]
*  and brown New Yorkers. In one notorious incident, he demonized an unarmed black man who was [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  shot and killed by the police. Clearly, even his recent turn as the public face of, frankly, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  the most vicious accusations of voter fraud is not really new. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=384.14s)]
*  A tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shea Freeman-Mars and one other gentleman [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  quite obviously surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  cocaine. I mean, it's obvious to anyone who's a criminal investigator or prosecutor, they [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=403.5s)]
*  are engaged in surreptitiously illegal activity again that day. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=409.06s)]
*  Now, that was false. And Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss have actually sued Rudy Giuliani for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=414.86s)]
*  defamation. But that kind of rhetoric, talking about these two black women as being drug [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=419.94s)]
*  dealers, stealing an election, that goes way back from the 1989 race for mayor, which [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=426.22s)]
*  Giuliani lost to the first black man elected mayor in New York, David Dinkins. As Giuliani [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=433.5s)]
*  himself told journalist Jack Newfield in an interview he quotes in his 2002 book, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=438.9s)]
*  The Full Rudy. This is 21 years ago. And I'm quoting him here. They stole that election [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=444.7s)]
*  from me. They stole votes in the black parts of Brooklyn and in Washington Heights. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=450.38s)]
*  Illegal Dominican immigrants were allowed to vote in Washington Heights. That sounds [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=455.78s)]
*  familiar, doesn't it? Has a certain ring to it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  Let me tell you, as a lifelong New Yorker, reporters in New York City and critics will [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=465.26s)]
*  tell you Rudy Giuliani has always been an absolute Machiavellian operator. So, yeah, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=469.98s)]
*  you might say, what happened to Rudy? Or you could say, this has always been Rudy. All [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=476.3s)]
*  the way to the end. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw8BPUZjU2Y&t=482.78s)]
