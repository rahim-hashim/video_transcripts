# ‘It’s all made up!’: Hayes breaks down ‘sheer lawlessness’ of Trump deportation case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA)
*  But let me just say, I think it's worth taking a step back to take a look at the very not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=0.0s)]
*  complicated big picture here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=5.44s)]
*  And that is this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=8.6s)]
*  This entire undertaking by the Trump administration is itself illegal, insanely, fragrant, lawless [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=10.44s)]
*  and rotten to its core. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=17.6s)]
*  And it has been from the start. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=19.02s)]
*  So let's remember how this all started to begin with, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=21.06s)]
*  The White House kicked off this deportation and renditioning scheme by invoking a little [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=25.38s)]
*  known 200 year old law, the Alien Enemies Act as justification. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=29.82s)]
*  And to be clear, prior to this administration, that law, the Alien Enemies Act, had only [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=33.14s)]
*  been invoked three times before. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  The War of 1812, when the Brits were here and burning down the White House, World War [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=40.06s)]
*  I, where tens of thousands were dying in the trenches, and World War II. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=45.0s)]
*  Most infamously, it was used as the justification for Japanese internment camps during the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Second World War, one of the most shameful periods of this country's history. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=55.06s)]
*  But all three times this act was invoked, the United States was actually and undeniably [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  at war, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=67.2s)]
*  But in order to create some justification to start this bizarre and appalling spectacle, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=70.4s)]
*  right, to kick legal residents out of the country in no due process, the White House [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=76.9s)]
*  just decided to pretend like we're at war again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=81.28s)]
*  We're at war with Venezuela. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=84.78s)]
*  Okay, are we? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=86.5s)]
*  But also, just to be specific, not just Venezuela, we're at war with this one specific gang, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  Tren de Arragua, which most Americans have never actually heard of. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=97.1s)]
*  Again, I'm reading from Trump's invocation, the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=101.62s)]
*  Tren de Arragua is a designated foreign terrorist organization with thousands of members, many [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=105.58s)]
*  unlawfully infiltrated the U.S. and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=110.33999999999999s)]
*  actions against the United States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=116.5s)]
*  The gang is closely aligned with and indeed has infiltrated the Maduro regime, including [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=118.5s)]
*  its military and law enforcement apparatus. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=123.5s)]
*  So first things first, it's a lie. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=127.14s)]
*  They're conducting irregular warfare. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=130.14s)]
*  This is like Al Qaeda being here or something. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=131.98s)]
*  Tren de Arragua is not an arm of Maduro's government. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=134.74s)]
*  Trump's own experts privately admit as much. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=138.54s)]
*  The New York Times reported on an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies, which, quote, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=141.14s)]
*  concluded the gang was not directed by Venezuela's government or committing crimes in the United [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=146.26s)]
*  States on its orders. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  So again, it's a lie. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=153.6s)]
*  It's a lie they know from inside, from their own intelligence assessment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=155.54s)]
*  It's on par with George W. Bush's administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=159.54s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=165.5s)]
*  Also, and I really can't stress this enough, we're not at war with Venezuela. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=166.5s)]
*  It's ludicrous to say we are. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=173.66s)]
*  Not only are we not at war, but the gang they've identified as a foreign terrorist organization [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=176.54s)]
*  being directed by a foreign government is not actually being directed by that government. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=182.66s)]
*  And they know all this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=187.4s)]
*  But then on top of this, they use these foundational lies to give them the power to snatch people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=189.78s)]
*  off the street because of their tattoos, which they have decided mark them as soldiers [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=196.34s)]
*  in the war they've made up out of whole cloth. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=202.62s)]
*  Like the gay makeup artist with crown tattoos or the man with an autism awareness tattoo [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=206.3s)]
*  in tribute to his little brother with autism or the singer and father of a newborn child [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=212.58s)]
*  with a hummingbird inked on his neck. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=217.54s)]
*  One guy went so far as to get a declaration from his tattoo artist confirming his tattoos, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=220.7s)]
*  including a rose, were not gang related. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=225.62s)]
*  The kicker to all of this is that according to the journalist who literally wrote the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=229.06s)]
*  book on Trende Aragua, quote, Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=234.06s)]
*  To be a member of one of these Venezuelan organizations, you don't need a tattoo. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=242.06s)]
*  So on top of the lies and the absurdities, this war they've invented that doesn't exist, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=247.06s)]
*  the power the government says they say has but doesn't have. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=251.76s)]
*  They're using something to target people that has nothing to do whatsoever with the deadly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=255.98s)]
*  menace they themselves cite as the pretext for the whole thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=260.86s)]
*  It's all made up, all of it from scratch. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=266.76s)]
*  And again, to step back, the tattoos are not the issue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=271.68s)]
*  It doesn't even matter if they are in the gang. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=274.62s)]
*  There are dangerous gangs in Venezuela and in South America. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=276.32s)]
*  They do really awful stuff, totally stipulated. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=279.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=283.52s)]
*  Arresting people without probable cause and then not just deporting them to a country [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=286.04s)]
*  to be a free citizen there, which is what normally happens in deportation, shipping [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=290.48s)]
*  them out of the country without due process to a horrifying prison they can never get [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=294.86s)]
*  out of in a country many of them have never been to is tyranny. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=299.66s)]
*  It's lawless defying U.S. court orders to do so is lawless. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=307.12s)]
*  There isn't a single part of this entire thing that stands up to the smallest amount of scrutiny. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=311.4s)]
*  The whole thing, the entire enterprise is just sheer lawlessness. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPEnrCgxkA&t=320.64s)]
