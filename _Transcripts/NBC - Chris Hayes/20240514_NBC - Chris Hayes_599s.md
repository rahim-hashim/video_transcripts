# Stunning lack of effort Trump defense tepid in attack on Cohen's damning testimony
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c)
*  Today, the defense began its cross-examination, which did not start off that well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's Trump attorney Todd Blanch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=5.8s)]
*  Mr. Cohen, my name is Todd Blanch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  You and I have never spoken or met before, have we? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=10.16s)]
*  Michael Cohen, we have not. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=12.6s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, but you know who I am, don't you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=14.4s)]
*  Cohen, I do. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=16.84s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, as a matter of fact, you went on TikTok and called me a crying little, and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=18.48s)]
*  this is a euphemism here, poop, didn't you? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=24.28s)]
*  Cohen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=27.64s)]
*  Sounds like something I would say. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=28.64s)]
*  Prosecutor Susan Hofender. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=30.92s)]
*  Objection, Your Honor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=32.64s)]
*  The court sustained. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=33.64s)]
*  At that point, Judge Juan Marchand called the lawyers into a sidebar, and while observers [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=34.64s)]
*  in the court could not hear that conversation, the official court transcript tells us what [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=39.52s)]
*  went down. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=43.92s)]
*  Here's the court, Judge Marchand. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Why are you making this about yourself, Mr. Blanch? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=46.56s)]
*  I'm not making it about myself, Your Honor. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=49.0s)]
*  I have a right to show this witness's bias, and he has expressed bias about the lawyers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=50.56s)]
*  just because of who he represents. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=55.44s)]
*  The court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  It doesn't matter if he has bias towards you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=62.04s)]
*  The issue is whether he has bias toward the defendant. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=63.04s)]
*  Don't make it about yourself. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=65.92s)]
*  I'm going to sustain the objection and instruct the jury. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=67.4s)]
*  Please don't make it about yourself. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=70.52s)]
*  The cross-examination did not get much better from there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=73.0s)]
*  During roughly two hours of questioning, Trump attorney Todd Blanch painted for the jury [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=77.2s)]
*  conflicting profiles of Michael Cohen and why he was testifying against Donald Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=82.52s)]
*  There was Michael Cohen, the unreliable narrator, who would lie about anything. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=87.6s)]
*  Then there was Michael Cohen, the jilted surrogate son trying to get back at his father figure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=92.16s)]
*  There was also Michael Cohen, the desperate prisoner who would say anything to get out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=97.32s)]
*  of jail. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=100.72s)]
*  And then there was Michael Cohen, the greedy self-promoter trying to cash in on turning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=102.0s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=106.64s)]
*  What we did not get from the defense, however, was a coherent narrative that explained why [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=108.68s)]
*  the jury should believe that Donald Trump is not guilty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  I was stunned by the lack of effort put towards actually dismantling a legal argument about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=117.72000000000001s)]
*  potential felonies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And it did move around a tremendous amount. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  It had a bunch of different conflicting theories, which again, if you're just trying to kind [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=128.08s)]
*  of rough the guy up and muddy him, okay, fine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=130.88s)]
*  But even if there was one point where they spent all this time, I mean, a lot of time [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=133.58s)]
*  on the fact that Michael Cohen keeps talking about the case, even though everyone involved [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=138.12s)]
*  in the case from the prosecutor's office is like, for the love of God, STFU Michael Cohen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=142.24s)]
*  He refuses to do so, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=147.4s)]
*  But I didn't, I mean, what I guess they were trying to do was to say, look, this is a guy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=151.2s)]
*  who doesn't listen and goes rogue and does his own thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=156.24s)]
*  I guess. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=159.96s)]
*  But Michael Cohen doesn't work for the DA's office. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=160.96s)]
*  The relationship he has with the DA's office is not the relationship he had with Donald [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=163.88s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=166.92s)]
*  It's a stretch to imagine that a guy who goes rogue is going to pay off a hundred a porn [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=167.92s)]
*  star one hundred and fifty forty thousand dollars using a home equity line of credit [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  just because he's a rogue operator. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=174.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=176.76s)]
*  And I felt like if that's what you are saying and maybe they will tie this up tomorrow or [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=177.76s)]
*  maybe they will do a great job of it in closing arguments. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=180.88s)]
*  If the point you're saying is, look, this is a guy who does his own thing and you can't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=183.2s)]
*  tell him what to do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=186.76s)]
*  It had never went anywhere. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=188.82s)]
*  There's just a lot of inquiries that felt like they started and never culminated. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  My feeling just sitting in that or flu or watching it in real time where I would even [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=194.28s)]
*  be a little on like they would get me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=199.0s)]
*  You know, Blanche is doing the cross examination rhythm where you're asking questions and Cohen [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  saying yes, sir. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  You're like, OK, right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  And there's like we're going. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Where are we going? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  And then it's like, yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  And then we just sort of peter out and then we move to another topic. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=212.36s)]
*  So I felt even though I said earlier, you know, there were moments where he did feel [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=214.52s)]
*  sort of squirrely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=218.24s)]
*  There were never felt like any kind of satisfying narrative catharsis in which I felt like, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=220.36s)]
*  oh, he's caught in a lie or he's that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=225.36s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=228.4s)]
*  I hadn't thought of it that way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=229.4s)]
*  There was no light bulb. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  There are two other people here on set who I'm sure have a lot of thoughts about the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=232.52s)]
*  defense. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=235.56s)]
*  I want to bring in now Ari Melber, MSNBC's chief legal correspondent and of course, the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=236.56s)]
*  host of the beat with Ari Melber. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=240.36s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=242.84s)]
*  And Katie Fang, MSNBC legal contributor and host of the Katie Fang show. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=243.84s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=248.52s)]
*  From a legal perspective, guys, at some point, does the defense not need to address this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=250.48s)]
*  idea that, yes, there was records manipulation and then the step up charge to get this to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=255.64s)]
*  a felony is a campaign finance violation of some sort that was never even in like the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=261.16s)]
*  actual criminal charges at the heart of this were not really addressed by the defense team [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=266.36s)]
*  during this entire cross examination. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=272.24s)]
*  Michael Cohen's the witness who they could go out on that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=274.28s)]
*  Well, I think they're doing cross on him and then when it's their turn, they have to decide [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=278.56s)]
*  whether they put up with their case or not. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=282.24s)]
*  And they don't have to, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=284.28s)]
*  They can just say prosecution didn't prove it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=285.56s)]
*  But on the defense side, today was about them trying to show the jury what they think are [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=288.4s)]
*  some of the worst of Michael Cohen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=292.32s)]
*  And I don't think they landed a knockout blow, but I think it was a bad day for Cohen and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=294.52s)]
*  the prosecution. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=298.16s)]
*  And I do think if you compare it to other witness days, I think they got a few more [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=299.16s)]
*  blows and jabs in there than against Daniels or Pecker or the other key witnesses. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=304.04s)]
*  And so again, what are we comparing it to? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  If you compare it to how this trial has been going and we've all been trading off and I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=311.12s)]
*  was in there this afternoon, I was watching the jury. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=314.88s)]
*  Sometimes they were watching like a tennis match. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  They were watching Blanche and then Cohen and then Blanche. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=318.8s)]
*  And so it's absolutely true that there was never a knockout and that it was halting and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=321.24s)]
*  he reset. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  But what I kind of observed is if you're looking for one or two or three jurors who were riveted [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  and then going, oh, that's bad. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=330.1s)]
*  And oh, Cohen sells anti-Trump merch and oh, Cohen says he's not obsessed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  And then Blanche says, but you wrote in your book, you are obsessed with Trump. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  And he says, OK, maybe I said that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  And then, oh, you're monetizing this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=341.66s)]
*  And oh, you've lied to investigators before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  It wasn't a great picture for him, although I don't think it dissolved everything he said. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=346.74s)]
*  That could I just say one thing before we go to Katie, which is that that that point [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=350.62s)]
*  is an important one, which is I think for me, I know a lot about Michael Cohen. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=358.54s)]
*  If you tell me, oh, Michael Cohen's make made millions of dollars off the anti-Trump book, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=359.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm like, yes, of course, Michael Cohen made millions. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  Oh, Michael Trump selling anti-Trump merch. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course, that's Michael Cohen's whole thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  That might that's news to the jury, presumably or maybe in a way that makes you think, oh, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  this guy is really grinding an axe. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=375.18s)]
*  But birds of a feather, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=377.98s)]
*  Very much birds of a feather. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=380.42s)]
*  That was really the theme of the last two days. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=381.98s)]
*  I mean, I say famously sometimes like, you know, giraffes, pigs don't marry giraffes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=383.98s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's a reason why. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump used Michael Cohen. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  Are you baffled by that one? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=392.7s)]
*  The pigs don't marry. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=393.94s)]
*  Just process. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=396.26s)]
*  I think there's a reason why Donald Trump loved using Michael Cohen, because he was [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=396.9s)]
*  effective for what Michael Cohen needed to do for Donald Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=402.97999999999996s)]
*  And that is the reason why he jettisoned him when he went to the White House, because he [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=406.5s)]
*  no longer could use Michael Cohen in that capacity. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=410.06s)]
*  But when it comes to cross-examination, it's not direct. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=413.17999999999995s)]
*  You're not going to have necessarily a through line, nor are you necessarily going to have [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=416.94s)]
*  a chronology being followed per se. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=422.29999999999995s)]
*  You're going to want to hit specific areas. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=424.58s)]
*  But what was so flawed about Blanche today is you got so disjointed following it that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=426.38s)]
*  you didn't understand that the zingers were actually landing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=432.7s)]
*  God bless you to Ari's point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=436.38s)]
*  And so because of that, if you are the jury and you're, as we talked about before, the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=438.26s)]
*  low information juror, you don't have the breadth of information that we do as we live in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=443.1s)]
*  this space. You're taking it in, but you're not understanding the import of it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=448.7s)]
*  But I do think simultaneously, though, because Trump does have the larger than life kind of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=453.42s)]
*  presence, Trump is the ultimate selling merch grifter. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=458.22s)]
*  So it's not like you're appalled when you hear that somebody else successfully has taken [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  that model and is making money. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=466.54s)]
*  Are you supposed to be grudged, Michael Cohen, because he's been disbarred because of what [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=468.38s)]
*  he did for him and he went to prison that he's making money off of it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=472.86s)]
*  They all are doing it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=476.38s)]
*  And so it's not like you want you're never going to get a clean person in this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=477.7s)]
*  Everybody has dirty hands. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And to that point, Ari, they built a scaffolding around Michael Cohen before they [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=482.7s)]
*  brought him out. Right. I mean, we started with David Pecker. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=487.94s)]
*  We have Stormy Daniels. We have a number of witnesses who corroborate the same facts that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=490.06s)]
*  Michael Cohen is. I mean, he's the last last witness, we're told, for the prosecution. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=494.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that was smart and both made sense. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  But also my observation is today is a reminder of why they saved him for last. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=501.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they had a sense as the questions gestured towards how unreliable he is, how he [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  was basically defying their requests. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=514.74s)]
*  That doesn't mean he's lying, but it certainly leaves the jury saying, well, even now, at [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=517.86s)]
*  the trial in the last few weeks, the question suggests that he wouldn't follow the rules. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=525.22s)]
*  And I do think again, I'm not saying it breaks the case, but if one or more jurors think [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  I have reasonable doubt as to whether this guy who doesn't have enough respect for the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=537.22s)]
*  system, who didn't follow the rules and being told about all the rules, maybe he's playing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=540.74s)]
*  with the timeline. Maybe he's playing with his accounting of Trump's intent. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=544.86s)]
*  Because, again, the records case has been established. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=548.62s)]
*  It's what we call documented by the documents and the signed checks by Donald Trump. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  But the intent has to be that Trump had the criminal intent to do it then, not in a reimbursement [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  afterward, not as we talked about last night, some later date. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=562.02s)]
*  And Cohen is key to that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=564.26s)]
*  You have to believe if you're a juror beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump did it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  OK, that's the documents that it was for the campaign. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  I've talked a lot about that and that Trump had that requisite criminal intent, which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=571.9s)]
*  Trump didn't write down. You need Cohen or someone else to get you there. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaBNFB4d9c&t=575.9399999999999s)]
