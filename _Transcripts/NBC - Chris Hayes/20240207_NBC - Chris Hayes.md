# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 7  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Trump has now become Citizen Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=3.44s)]
*  Citizen Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=6.32s)]
*  Citizen Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=7.32s)]
*  Now it's Citizen Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=8.32s)]
*  Most people would be quite proud to be called Citizen Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=9.8s)]
*  Citizen Trump makes headlines across the globe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  What it means is that his great thing about, I'm untouchable, you can't touch me, I'm [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=16.64s)]
*  a bot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=20.04s)]
*  I mean, which is embarrassing anyway, simply doesn't stack up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=21.04s)]
*  Tonight the race to get Donald Trump inside Judge Chuckin's courtroom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=24.04s)]
*  I think they have to find that Section 3 applies to people who foment and participate in insurrections. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=28.64s)]
*  Alex Wagner on her exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=39.0s)]
*  Plus if you try to move a bill that solves the border crisis during this presidential [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=42.4s)]
*  year, I will do whatever I can to destroy you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=49.16s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy on the Republican sabotage of their own border bill. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=53.36s)]
*  And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the chaos in the House and what Democrats need to get [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=57.76s)]
*  done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=62.32s)]
*  All In starts right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=63.32s)]
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=70.0s)]
*  It is all about the clock and the calendar. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  That has been clear ever since the first criminal charges came down against Donald Trump last [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=75.28s)]
*  spring. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=79.6s)]
*  Our justice system moves at its own speed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=80.88s)]
*  There is a finite amount of time for the ex-president to be tried on the 91 charges he now faces [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=84.2s)]
*  before voters go to the polls on Election Day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, everyone knows this and Trump certainly knows this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=94.2s)]
*  It is why, remember, he announced his 2024 campaign for president all the way back in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=97.32s)]
*  November of 2022. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=103.12s)]
*  That was one of his first attempts to shield himself politically from the legal accountability [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  that he knew was coming. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=110.34s)]
*  And of course, since then, Trump has been doing everything possible to slow down the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=112.66s)]
*  wheels of justice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  He is basically in a race with a very sluggish system, trying to make it to November 5th [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  when he very well could be elected president again before justice can catch up and put [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=125.58s)]
*  him on trial. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=129.94s)]
*  The goal is to get back in the White House in order to keep himself out of prison, perhaps [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=131.7s)]
*  for the rest of his natural life. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=136.88s)]
*  Yesterday, he was dealt a serious blow in that effort. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=139.52s)]
*  In a monumental decision, a federal appeals court ruled, Donald Trump is not immune from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=142.8s)]
*  prosecution and must face trial in a federal case related to his attempt to steal the 2020 [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=147.08s)]
*  election. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=153.92s)]
*  The three-judge panel, made up of both Republican and Democratic appointees, said, quote, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=154.92s)]
*  For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=159.32s)]
*  with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=163.96s)]
*  We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=167.2s)]
*  for all time thereafter. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  How will that stinging rebuke actually affect what in the end really matters here, which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=175.04s)]
*  is the calendar? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=180.54s)]
*  So this case, the four felony counts against Donald Trump brought by special counsel Jack [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  Smith, has already been pending for a while. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=186.88s)]
*  Back in August, it was assigned to district judge Tanya Chutkin, who said that she intended [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=189.62s)]
*  to swiftly move it to trial. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=194.92s)]
*  Of course, Trump started employing every possible delay tactic, eventually bringing his dubious [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  immunity claim to the appeals court. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=202.92s)]
*  Now at that point, this was in mid-December, just about two months ago, Judge Chutkin put [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  the case on hold. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  She paused it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  So now, two months later, we finally have their decision. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  But the court is giving Trump until next Monday, February 12th, to appeal to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=216.16s)]
*  Now keep in mind, this trial was originally set to begin on March 4th, which is less than [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  a month from now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=226.6s)]
*  That is no longer going to happen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=227.6s)]
*  In fact, Judge Chutkin formally postponed it last week. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  Even if the Supreme Court decides not to take up Trump's case and makes that decision quickly, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=233.72s)]
*  which is a possibility, the trial would most likely not start until May at the earliest. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's because Judge Chutkin, I think quite rightly, has said she would give Trump's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=244.28s)]
*  team back all that trial preparation time they lost while the case was on pause. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=248.4s)]
*  So they've already lost about two months since the clock stopped on December 13th. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=253.56s)]
*  So again, if she sticks to her word, right, and the Supreme Court decides like tomorrow [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=257.32s)]
*  they're not taking it, they don't even have a petition yet, so that can't happen, but [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=262.4s)]
*  she would push the trial date back two months from early March to early May. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=265.88s)]
*  Again, earliest possible start, which again, is within enough time if everything goes against [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=269.72s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=276.48s)]
*  But if not, if the Supreme Court takes up the case, it will drag on even further with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=278.44s)]
*  the court getting involved. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=284.24s)]
*  Then the question becomes, and this is one that we've had our eyes on from the very [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=285.76s)]
*  beginning, it's been clear as day, whether the conservative members of the court, particularly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=289.92s)]
*  the three handpicked by Donald Trump himself, will rob the American voters of the indispensable [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=296.44s)]
*  knowledge ahead of the election. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=303.8s)]
*  Will they let the American voters find out whether this man, who stands before them seeking [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=305.78s)]
*  the presidency, is in fact guilty of the gravest crime against the republic since the Civil [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=311.44s)]
*  War? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  Are they going to let the judicial process play out to render a definitive verdict guilty [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  or not guilty? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=324.29999999999995s)]
*  Will they allow American voters to know that the man is in fact innocent before they go [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=325.7s)]
*  to the polls? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=329.73999999999995s)]
*  Or are they just going to take that away from all of us? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=330.73999999999995s)]
*  If the conservatives in the court want to be supremely hackish, they could conceivably, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=334.98s)]
*  the court, essentially kill this case. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=343.3s)]
*  They could delay it for as long basically as they want. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=345.1s)]
*  They can also, on the other hand, move very quickly if they want to resolve the question. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=349.94s)]
*  We've seen this before with Bush v. Gore when there were votes being counted and they had [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  to rush to make sure they stopped and then Bush was president. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=358.68s)]
*  We've seen it during the pandemic when they just practically raced to hear challenges [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=362.42s)]
*  to COVID restrictions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  Of course, there are people in the court who I think probably have an interest in delaying, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=368.38s)]
*  have a little bit of a rooting interest politically, ideology, helping Donald Trump out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  One name that just comes to mind is Justice Clarence Thomas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=378.06s)]
*  The reason it comes to mind is that that guy is married to a woman who was texting Donald [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump's chief of staff about the coup, about stealing the election. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=388.1s)]
*  And he's not going to recuse, I don't think, from this case. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=393.70000000000005s)]
*  So this is where we are. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=397.82000000000005s)]
*  The soonest this trial could possibly start is May. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=398.82000000000005s)]
*  And again, that's fine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  That's enough time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=402.86s)]
*  Not enough time for really for Republican primary voters who have already been robbed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=403.86s)]
*  of their opportunity to know the truth. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=407.22s)]
*  If the Supreme Court decides to intervene, then that could eat up months. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=411.26000000000005s)]
*  The trial itself could take more than three months. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=414.5s)]
*  The election is in November. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=417.68s)]
*  The clock is ticking. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=419.56s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=421.24s)]
*  If the Supreme Court takes away our ability to know this, if they rob us of a trial for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=424.32s)]
*  Trump before the election for his attempt to overthrow American democracy, that will [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=434.4s)]
*  be the second gravest crime committed against the republic since the Civil War. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=438.88s)]
*  Dahlia Lithwick is a senior editor at Slate who's been covering the Supreme Court for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=444.12s)]
*  decades. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=447.8s)]
*  Mary McCord spent nearly 20 years as a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=448.8s)]
*  D.C. where she serves as chief of the criminal division. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=452.64s)]
*  And they joined me now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Dahlia, let me start with you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=457.44s)]
*  During this last month when the case was in the hands of the three judges on the D.C. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  Circuit, I would come on here, and I'm an impatient person anyway, so everyone should [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=466.24s)]
*  take this with a grain of salt. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=469.92s)]
*  I know this about myself. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=471.0s)]
*  I'm an impatient person who works in cable news, which is like the most impatient medium [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=472.92s)]
*  in the world. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=475.68s)]
*  And I'm like, what are we doing here? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=476.68s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=477.92s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=478.92s)]
*  People, all the law people said, no, no, no. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=479.92s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=480.92s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=481.92s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=482.92s)]
*  What's reasonable here? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=483.92s)]
*  Like, what's a reasonable benchmark for what happens next with this court? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=484.92s)]
*  What should we be looking for where it's like, oh, okay, this is acceptable or indications [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=489.0s)]
*  of like something's askew here? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=494.24s)]
*  I mean, Chris, I think my benchmark is how the court has handled the Colorado case, the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=497.28s)]
*  ballot case that it's hearing tomorrow, right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=503.55999999999995s)]
*  Which we know that the court knows how to expedite a case because they're doing it [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=506.88s)]
*  tomorrow, right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  They understood the urgency. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=513.24s)]
*  It was a pretty compressed, you know, briefing period. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=515.12s)]
*  So the answer to your question is, as you said, if you use Bush v. Gore, if you use [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=520.84s)]
*  Nixon, the court knows how to do things in an expedited fashion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=527.0s)]
*  I think the question really becomes, does the court think that there's the same urgency [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=532.36s)]
*  around hearing this criminal prosecution in Judge Chutkin's court, that they thought, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=540.64s)]
*  you know, there's an exigent reason to hear the Colorado ballot case because they got [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=549.0s)]
*  to print ballots, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=553.76s)]
*  That's exigent. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=555.24s)]
*  And so everything that you are raising as exigencies, in other words, the American public needs [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=556.44s)]
*  to have this trial happen before the election, the question is whether you've got four, five, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=561.6s)]
*  six members of the court who agree with you that that is as exigent as the election's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=568.56s)]
*  case being heard tomorrow. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=573.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=574.6s)]
*  And that point there about the number is key, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=575.6s)]
*  Because when we say that when we use the court, right, what we mean is five votes on the court. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=577.28s)]
*  I mean, four to grant cert, but five for a stay. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=583.24s)]
*  So it's like it's five. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=585.32s)]
*  It's five votes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=586.84s)]
*  The court itself is made up of nine people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=588.0s)]
*  And, Mary, do you agree with that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=591.12s)]
*  Is it basically how you're viewing it as well? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=597.72s)]
*  I, you know, I think that there is a chance, and I've said this before, that the Supreme [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=598.4s)]
*  Court will deny cert. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=603.4s)]
*  I mean, this was a unanimous opinion. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=604.84s)]
*  It's a strong opinion. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=606.84s)]
*  They don't even have to agree with every single word in the opinion. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  If any parts that they don't agree with are not load bearing to the result, you know, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=612.0s)]
*  there's discussions about multiple different things leading to the same legal conclusion. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=618.24s)]
*  They don't have to take cert just to express some difference of opinion on something that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=623.96s)]
*  doesn't actually matter to the result. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=629.0s)]
*  So if that's the case, of course, as you've already indicated, we have the potential to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=631.2s)]
*  be to trial in May. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=635.28s)]
*  If not, you're right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=636.88s)]
*  I think it comes down to Monday. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=637.8s)]
*  You know, they could, if they decide they want to take the case and if they agree that, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=639.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, and I think they will, that there is an urgency to it, I think they will see [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=646.68s)]
*  that this is important. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=650.76s)]
*  And I don't think they would like the look of being responsible for a lengthy delay. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  So I think if they take it, they will expedite it, probably along the lines of their expediting [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=656.64s)]
*  the case that's going to be heard tomorrow. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=662.24s)]
*  But they could take accept it for review just based on a motion for a stay. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=664.72s)]
*  You know, they did that in Bush v Gore. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=670.76s)]
*  So they could if they really want to expedite and they've got the votes to take cert, they [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  could just grant it on Monday. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=677.28s)]
*  And that's an important point, because let me give the sort of most egregiously hackish [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=680.28s)]
*  thing to do here would just to take it in regular order. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=684.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  So this is Normais and Matthew Seligman and Josh Kolb writing in Just Security. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=690.04s)]
*  It's within their power not to enforce an expedited appellate schedule. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=695.16s)]
*  If so, they could conceivably wait until the end of this year's term in late June issues [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=697.9599999999999s)]
*  decisions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  That's, you know, the end of June is when all the big decisions come out. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  And under that approach, the trial would not begin until approximately October 1st and would [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=705.52s)]
*  not conclude until about January 1, 2025. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=709.4s)]
*  That strikes me, Dahlia, as unlikely. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=715.88s)]
*  The sort of like, yes, we'll take it under no expedited review. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  And we'll argue and then we'll issue the opinion late June. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=721.64s)]
*  Like that, they're not going to do that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=725.96s)]
*  Right, Dahlia? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=728.24s)]
*  I've been joking all day looking at that decision tree and just security that I did not go to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=729.88s)]
*  law school to do like three dimensional time temporal, you know, jurisprudence. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  But I agree with you completely. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=742.64s)]
*  I think the most hackish thing would be to push this all off until October so that voters [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  literally don't know what's happening as they go to vote. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=751.88s)]
*  And I think that you I can't count four, five votes at the court who think that fomenting [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=756.12s)]
*  chaos right now is a good idea. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  I also think and this is again, Dahlia, to your point, there's a sort of interesting [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=767.16s)]
*  question here, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=770.64s)]
*  There's these sort of legal questions and then there's public interest questions and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=771.64s)]
*  they're not detached. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=774.52s)]
*  I mean, we're all woven into the fabric of American democracy here, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=775.52s)]
*  Like this isn't some but it also strikes me, Marion, there's a point I made before is that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=778.8s)]
*  like in some ways it's already too late for Republican primary voters who are not going [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=782.96s)]
*  to get to make an informed decision on whether they want to end and in some ways too late [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=787.72s)]
*  in a way that may end up being for their party and strictly partisan terms kind of catastrophic, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=793.04s)]
*  which is nominating a guy who's going to stand trial and like maybe the fall and get convicted. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=798.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=803.6s)]
*  I mean, obviously there are already Republicans who have voted right in their primaries and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=804.6s)]
*  there's others even when the primary hasn't been held yet who have already done their [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=809.0s)]
*  absentee ballots or their mail-in ballots. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=812.72s)]
*  We have service members abroad, et cetera. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=814.96s)]
*  So there's no question here that this is already impacting people's votes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=816.92s)]
*  And it's not the only thing impacting it because the case to be heard tomorrow is also impacting [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=822.96s)]
*  if he were to actually, you know, if the Supreme Court were to actually affirm the Colorado [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=827.52s)]
*  Supreme Court and say that he is ineligible under the 14th Amendment Section 3, already [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=831.84s)]
*  a number of people have voted, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=837.04s)]
*  So I think, you know, what it's incumbent upon people to do is be paying attention and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=839.64s)]
*  to be thinking through what the potential consequences are and they've got to make a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=844.48s)]
*  decision when they go to cast their ballot, are they really willing to take that chance [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=848.24s)]
*  or not? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=852.64s)]
*  Dahlia Elizabeth and Mary McCord, great pleasure to have you both on Off the Top here. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=853.64s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=857.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=858.44s)]
*  There's a big crazy news day, a lot coming up tonight. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=859.44s)]
*  We got my buddy Alex Wagner with an exclusive preview of her interview with Hillary Clinton. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=863.8800000000001s)]
*  We've also got Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=869.1600000000001s)]
*  First, after Donald Trump destroys a bipartisan border bill, Senator Chris Murphy, who negotiated [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=872.2800000000001s)]
*  the bill on a just utterly jaw-dropping day in the U.S. Senate. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=878.5200000000001s)]
*  That's next. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=883.0s)]
*  We delivered a bipartisan bill to fix the border with the Republican senator appointed [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=887.32s)]
*  by the Republican caucus to cut the deal. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  And within 24 hours before the ink was even dry, Republican senators decided they don't [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=900.46s)]
*  want a bipartisan bill to fix the border. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=906.84s)]
*  They want to pretend they never asked for a bipartisan border bill. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=911.6s)]
*  Because what they actually want is chaos. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=916.2s)]
*  Because that's what Donald Trump says he wants. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=920.5200000000001s)]
*  What the hell just happened? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  Today, Senate Republicans killed a border deal, they voted it down, that they themselves [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=927.6400000000001s)]
*  had demanded and spent months negotiating. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=933.48s)]
*  It's all part of a sustained effort to appreciably damage our country, to make things worse in [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  America so that Donald Trump has a better chance of being elected running against an [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=942.52s)]
*  incumbent. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=948.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=949.28s)]
*  If you think that is hyperbole, okay, I want you to listen to the very conservative, I [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=950.28s)]
*  mean, really conservative Republican senator who was the key to negotiating this deal, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  appointed by his caucus to do so, James Lankford of Oklahoma, on the floor of the Senate today, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=961.24s)]
*  explaining what the hell just happened. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=967.4s)]
*  I had a popular commentator four weeks ago that I talked to that told me flat out before [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=970.28s)]
*  they knew any of the contents of the bill, any of the content, nothing was out at that [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=979.76s)]
*  point, that told me flat out, if you try to move a bill that solves the border crisis [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=984.12s)]
*  during this presidential year, I will do whatever I can to destroy you. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=990.16s)]
*  Because I do not want you to solve this during the presidential election. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  It seems pretty clear what happened with the Republican senators who voted to sink this [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1000.64s)]
*  deal. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1005.28s)]
*  One of the people who worked closely with Senator Lankford, who had a front row seat [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1006.28s)]
*  to this entire spectacle, is Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the chief Democratic [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1009.8399999999999s)]
*  negotiator on this deal, and he joins me now. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1014.0s)]
*  So Senator, it was like a week and a half ago when this bill was coming together, and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1016.56s)]
*  I was reporting on it, and I was talking to various people, and people were wondering [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  what was going to be in it, and I was talking to our team here. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  I was like, let's get Senator Murphy. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1027.44s)]
*  I want to argue with him about the provisions of this border bill. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1028.44s)]
*  But we're not going to do that interview because it died. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  At some point in the future, we'll argue about what's in it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1035.5600000000002s)]
*  But let's just table that for a moment. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1037.68s)]
*  I want to just retrace this. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1041.04s)]
*  For my 20 years covering this issue, the trade is this. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  They want more border security and enhancement. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1046.7s)]
*  Democrats want a path to citizenship. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1049.76s)]
*  This time around, the negotiation didn't have a path to citizenship. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1052.24s)]
*  It was entirely on their terms in order to get Ukraine funding, right? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, Chris, that's been a failed play for 20 years. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1065.1599999999999s)]
*  So you are right that that has been the Democratic strategy for 30 years, maybe, and it has failed [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1068.48s)]
*  to deliver for the people we care about most, the undocumented Americans that are in this country. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1075.32s)]
*  This is also not 2013 any longer. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  When we ran that play last back then, there were a couple hundred people showing up every [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  day applying for asylum today. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1089.72s)]
*  On some days, there are eight thousand. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1091.32s)]
*  And the reality is, is that the bulk of this country does not think that that's right or [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1093.64s)]
*  sustainable and wants us to change the reality at the border. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1098.24s)]
*  So I know there's a temptation for Democrats and I know you weren't looking for this argument, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1102.04s)]
*  but I think there is a temptation to just run the same play we always run because we know [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1106.24s)]
*  how to run it. But when it hasn't worked and when the country is actually demanding [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1110.76s)]
*  that we do something to make the border more manageable, I do think we have a right and a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1115.76s)]
*  responsibility to adjust to that reality. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1120.48s)]
*  Now, this bill still had in it some really important things for migrant rights, including a [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1122.72s)]
*  right to representation and earlier work permits and the biggest expansion of visas in 30 [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1127.0s)]
*  years. It's not a pathway to citizenship, but it is something substantial for people that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1132.4s)]
*  actually care about migrants. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1138.44s)]
*  But in the end, all of this didn't matter because as it turns out, Republicans are just [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1139.76s)]
*  absolutely allergic to fixing the problem at the border because they are so used to having [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1145.56s)]
*  this be their perennial election year issue. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1151.24s)]
*  They just couldn't give it up in the end. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1154.96s)]
*  So they asked James Langford to cut this deal. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1157.04s)]
*  He did exactly what they asked. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1159.04s)]
*  Mitch McConnell was in the room for the entirety of the negotiation. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1160.52s)]
*  And in the end, even Mitch McConnell voted against it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1163.52s)]
*  Only three others joined James Langford on the floor today to support the bipartisan [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  border fix bill. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1170.44s)]
*  What's interesting in your response there, I can sense from you that you spent a lot of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1171.48s)]
*  time working on this. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1175.44s)]
*  This wasn't a you like you were proud of this bill like you like to your point, like on [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1176.84s)]
*  the substance, on the merits. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1181.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like it wasn't like, well, we have to do this to get X, Y and Z and we're back into a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1183.2s)]
*  political corner like you think that this is a real issue, that there were real serious [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1187.92s)]
*  people trying to do it in a in a way that was going to be a classic sort of give and take [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1193.32s)]
*  half a loaf situation, but was going to be better than status quo and basically make [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1198.0s)]
*  things better for the country at the border. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1202.52s)]
*  Like a net improvement that you were proud to go around and try to get votes for and pass [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1205.84s)]
*  and have law become law. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1210.6s)]
*  Listen, I think you were watching the issue of migration take down left and center left [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1214.04s)]
*  governments all around the world right now. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1220.52s)]
*  I think we are at the point where if we didn't bring some sense of order to the border, if we [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1223.8799999999999s)]
*  didn't make a big down payment on reform to the asylum system, we were going to have a really [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1229.28s)]
*  hard time holding on to a consensus in this country that we should keep legal immigration [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1234.6s)]
*  pathways alive. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1241.0s)]
*  And so I am of the belief that this was a moment where you had to show some big bipartisan [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1242.76s)]
*  momentum and progress on the border or you would never ever have the ability to try to rescue [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1249.0s)]
*  the undocumented Americans that desperately need help. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1255.92s)]
*  So, yes, I was ready to sell this bill to my colleagues. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1260.12s)]
*  And of course, my Democratic colleagues did support it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1263.64s)]
*  I think about 80, 90 percent of Democrats voted for it today. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1267.72s)]
*  Eighty, 90 percent of Republicans voted against it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1271.28s)]
*  And the silver lining here is that at least we know where Republicans are. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1273.6s)]
*  Republicans have definitively decided that they want chaos at the border. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1277.68s)]
*  They don't want to solve this problem. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1281.5200000000002s)]
*  And maybe, maybe an issue that a lot of folks thought was going to be a negative for Democrats [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1282.92s)]
*  going into the election has the ability to at least draw us even as more people just don't [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1288.0800000000002s)]
*  believe Republicans arguments that they want to do something when they had the chance and they [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1293.5600000000002s)]
*  turned it down. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1297.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, the thing that's there's two things that are striking to me. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1298.3200000000002s)]
*  And again, you've been working on this for 20 years. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1300.44s)]
*  I've been covering it for 20 years. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1302.5200000000002s)]
*  You know, people forget they did have unified control of all of governance for two years [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1304.12s)]
*  when Donald Trump was elected and they did squat, bupkis, nothing, zero. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1308.12s)]
*  They cut corporations taxes. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1311.9199999999998s)]
*  OK, so like it's like if you don't like if you don't like the negotiation you have to do [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1313.76s)]
*  with Democrats, you could have done it yourself and you didn't. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  But second of all, what Langford said today, it's like I don't know how much in the end [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1320.56s)]
*  reality is going to matter to the marginal swing voter. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1324.96s)]
*  But for him to come out and be like, they killed my colleagues killed this. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1328.96s)]
*  Because it's an election year and they want Donald Trump to win like that's plain as day. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1334.2s)]
*  Those are the facts of what happened. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1338.28s)]
*  Do you think in the end that will matter to the politics of the issue? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1340.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, you know that it only matters if we repeat it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  And I do think that Democrats, especially over the last several years, have become so used [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1350.84s)]
*  to being on the defensive on this issue of immigration that we just refuse to talk about it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1356.56s)]
*  And we let Republicans define the issue. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1361.76s)]
*  We now have the opportunity to go on the offensive, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1364.56s)]
*  We have the receipts. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1367.44s)]
*  We can show people that there was a breakthrough bipartisan bill that if passed, would have [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1369.48s)]
*  brought some order to the border. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1375.64s)]
*  Frankly, the reason Republicans turned against it was because we did too good a job. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1377.12s)]
*  We actually were going to give President Biden tools that would be able to control numbers. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1380.92s)]
*  And Republicans couldn't imagine a world in which they didn't have the border to run on this November. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1387.16s)]
*  So I think we can flip the script on Republicans. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1394.6s)]
*  I wasn't looking to gain political advantage. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1398.44s)]
*  I was trying to solve a problem, but they don't want to solve the problem. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1400.4s)]
*  So our obligation is to go on offense and explain to voters that Republicans are not [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1403.76s)]
*  sincere when they say they want to fix the problem because they had an opportunity and [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1409.52s)]
*  almost to a person they ran for the hills. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1413.56s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, who spent a lot of time on that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1418.48s)]
*  But, you know, that's being a U.S. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1421.4s)]
*  Senator in our day and age. Thanks a lot. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1424.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1425.48s)]
*  Thanks, man. Still ahead, Hillary Clinton is speaking out about Donald Trump's loss on [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1427.84s)]
*  immunity and his big day in the Supreme Court tomorrow. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1433.32s)]
*  Alex Wagner is here to talk about her exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton next. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1435.08s)]
*  So tomorrow we're going to have oral arguments in the Supreme Court, which will decide. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1443.52s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, the case will decide whether Donald Trump, having engaged in insurrection, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1448.52s)]
*  should be allowed on the ballot in the state of Colorado, maybe beyond. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1453.56s)]
*  Ahead of tomorrow's oral arguments, we have a bit of analysis from one former lawyer, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  Senator, First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an exclusive interview [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1461.24s)]
*  tonight with our own Alex Wagner. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1466.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court is taking up the 14th Amendment question tomorrow, right? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1468.32s)]
*  The idea of effectively defeating Trump by getting him off the ballot. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1472.12s)]
*  Do you think that is a good endeavor or not? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1476.12s)]
*  I think the argument is very strongly on their side. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, what's the remedy? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1482.6799999999998s)]
*  Is the remedy for the Supreme Court to say, no, he can't be on the ballot? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1484.0s)]
*  Or is the remedy for the court to say this very well can apply constitutionally? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1488.32s)]
*  But it's up to the states to make the determination, because remember, states in our federalist [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1494.24s)]
*  system actually run elections. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1499.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1502.4s)]
*  And I think that might be where the court ends up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1503.4s)]
*  If they want to be true to their so-called originalist interpretation, then I think they [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1507.28s)]
*  have to find that Section 3 applies to people who foment and participate in it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1513.52s)]
*  But the remedy lies in the states, which would be kind of a fair way of kind of parsing this. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1520.44s)]
*  Do you worry, though, if it's left up to the states, you basically get Trump taken off [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1527.0s)]
*  the ballot in blue states and staying on the ballot in red states? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1531.28s)]
*  That's what our federalist system, you know, very well may lead to. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1534.48s)]
*  I think it'd be better if he were just roundly defeated. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1538.52s)]
*  But on the other hand, I also think that the Supreme Court is going to have to make the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1542.8s)]
*  The rest of that fascinating, wide-ranging interview airs tonight, right after this show [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1547.64s)]
*  at 9 p.m. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1551.64s)]
*  And joining me now is my friend Alex Wagner, host of Alex Weischer Night. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1552.64s)]
*  You just saw her. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1555.92s)]
*  That's the same one, same person. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1556.92s)]
*  I changed my top. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1557.92s)]
*  You're a different outfit. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1558.92s)]
*  Television magic. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1559.92s)]
*  I'm so fascinated. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1560.92s)]
*  By the way, it's a great interview. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1563.92s)]
*  I actually watched it, and I read the transcripts in preparation for this. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1564.92s)]
*  I want to start on the fact that you're a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1568.4s)]
*  I want to start on the Ukraine stuff, because she's doing an event at Columbia on that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1575.16s)]
*  On the future of Ukraine. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1580.4s)]
*  What a time to be talking about the future of Ukraine. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1581.4s)]
*  Right, and at a time when, you know, this is, in some ways, that issue has been a little [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1584.16s)]
*  backgrounded by the border stuff and Majorca, and now Israel. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1588.5600000000002s)]
*  The political footballing of Ukraine, and we've lost sight of what's actually happening [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  in that country, which is desperate, you know? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1595.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the idea, I mean, and we'll talk about this more in the 9 o'clock hour. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  The background of all this political gamesmanship is people's lives hanging in the balance. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1601.44s)]
*  You know, Vladimir Zelensky has been deeply involved in, like, weird congressional stuff, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1606.0s)]
*  because the future of his movement for democracy, aka the sovereignty of Ukraine, lies in, you [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1610.92s)]
*  know, I guess Mitch McConnell's ability to get the football into the end zone, or whatever [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  Vicks metaphor I'm going with here. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1620.96s)]
*  But it is, the cravenness and the sort of dehumanization of a people is staggering at [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  this moment when you look at what Republicans have done here. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1629.68s)]
*  And she seems intent on sort of getting people's attention back on Ukraine. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1631.72s)]
*  She is, although I will say she's remarkably bullish about the aid getting passed quite [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1636.44s)]
*  quickly. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1642.0400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of the sound, but... [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1643.0400000000002s)]
*  No, I also, that, I was like, you have better odds than I do at this point. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1645.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she has better odds on it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1651.0400000000002s)]
*  Like she thinks it's going to pass in a way that I'm not... [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1653.68s)]
*  And look, she's a former senator. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1655.88s)]
*  We talk about former secretary of state, former presidential candidate. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1657.36s)]
*  She logged her time in the Senate. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  And I, you know, I understand the dynamics in a way that perhaps you and I don't, is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  more optimistic, I think, about the goodness of at least the upper chamber. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1667.4799999999998s)]
*  But I mean, when you saw what you saw yesterday unfold on the House floor, it's really hard [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1671.4799999999998s)]
*  to imagine how, you know, the adults in the room take charge of the gavel once again. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1675.12s)]
*  You also asked her about Vladimir Putin giving an interview to like an online video guy, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1680.16s)]
*  which she, she's like the American dude who went over there to basically like tell her [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  how awesome he was. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1695.8400000000001s)]
*  This is kind of like going rogue in Moscow. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  And she, you know, like her views on Putin have been clear for a long time and her views [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1699.76s)]
*  on this blogger going to do the interview were also pretty clear. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1703.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1708.92s)]
*  Am I allowed to say his name? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1709.92s)]
*  Yes, yes, I'm just... [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1710.92s)]
*  His name is Tucker Carlson and he is the only American journalist who has been able to interview [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1711.92s)]
*  Putin since the invasion in 2022. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1717.76s)]
*  And you know, again, we'll be talking about this later at 9pm, but she calls him a useful [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1720.4s)]
*  idiot. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1724.92s)]
*  Paraphrasing, not paraphrasing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1725.92s)]
*  Not paraphrasing, she says it's useful. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1726.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1727.92s)]
*  Quoting Lenin that he's effectively a tool of... [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1728.92s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is a tool of Vladimir Putin, a mouthpiece for Kremlin propaganda. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1731.04s)]
*  And it's honestly hard to debate her on that, right? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1736.24s)]
*  Like if you look at what Tucker Carlson's been doing with Viktor Orban, with Vladimir [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1739.52s)]
*  Putin just on a strongman tour of the globe. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1743.6s)]
*  But this is why, Chris, you know, there is a line to be drawn between Tucker Carlson [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1747.92s)]
*  interviewing Vladimir Putin and the resistance in the Republican Party to pass this Ukraine [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1752.84s)]
*  aid, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1756.44s)]
*  Like... [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1757.44s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1758.44s)]
*  He's doing it for that reason. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1759.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1760.44s)]
*  And either they're useful idiots and don't realize it or it's something more craven than [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1761.44s)]
*  that. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1764.96s)]
*  And by the way, my favorite part of that, the detail of that was that he was proudly [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1766.68s)]
*  telling everyone this is the first person to even try to interview Putin. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1768.56s)]
*  Which is... [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1771.96s)]
*  Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, is like, no, we get requests all the time. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1772.96s)]
*  We decline them. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1777.6000000000001s)]
*  And we usually lock them up in jail. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1778.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  We said yes to you because you're no danger and you're a propagandist. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  He didn't actually say this. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1782.32s)]
*  But there's a... [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1783.32s)]
*  Whereas the other ones, we've got, you know, we've got a Wall Street Journal reporter in [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1784.32s)]
*  prison right now. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1787.52s)]
*  I didn't get to say this to Chris Murphy, but I'm going to ask you, because you're sitting [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  here and you talked about this. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1793.88s)]
*  Because we look a lot alike. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1795.12s)]
*  Well, also because she's so bullish, it's like, the thing I don't get about this idea [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1796.36s)]
*  that the Ukraine aid is going to pass is like, isn't Trump just going to whip against that, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1801.44s)]
*  too? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1806.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1807.76s)]
*  I mean, like, why is it... [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1808.76s)]
*  Like, this idea that, like, everyone's a little so surprised he came out against the border [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1809.76s)]
*  deal. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1812.36s)]
*  It's like, OK, well, we're not that surprised. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1813.36s)]
*  But like, now, OK, now we're going to go pass the Ukraine aid. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1814.36s)]
*  I'm like, guys... [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1817.8s)]
*  And didn't even try and cover his tracks. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1818.8s)]
*  No. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1821.6s)]
*  And the explicit nature of the fealty is so... it's so brazen. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1822.6s)]
*  He literally is, you know, true socialing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1827.84s)]
*  Don't pass this. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  And Mitch McConnell literally says, we can't pass it because Donald Trump basically doesn't [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1831.1599999999999s)]
*  want us to pass it in an election year. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1834.36s)]
*  Nobody even tries to pretend otherwise. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1835.7199999999998s)]
*  But to your point, I mean, you would argue, like, he has as much vested in an ongoing [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1837.8s)]
*  kind of conflagration in Ukraine as he does with chaos on the border. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1842.9599999999998s)]
*  So why wouldn't Trump stop anything from being done about it? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1846.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1849.6s)]
*  The guy who helped get him elected the first time? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1850.6s)]
*  I mean, yes, the sort of the... [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1851.6s)]
*  Obviously, they're all loyal to Trump and we all know that, whatever. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1855.76s)]
*  But the sort of the quickness... [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1858.9599999999998s)]
*  But they are also loyal to Putin. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1859.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we are now looking at a moment, a real sort of like line in the sand where the [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1862.32s)]
*  Republican Party is loyal to Putin. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1867.52s)]
*  That is the natural extension of this logic. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  United property. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1872.32s)]
*  Alex Wagner, whose exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton, which again, it is a really [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1873.32s)]
*  fascinating interview. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1877.56s)]
*  They touch on a ton of topics. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1878.7199999999998s)]
*  The protesters are fascinating the exchange on Israel and Gaza and protest, which is really, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1880.04s)]
*  really interesting. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1884.16s)]
*  So all of that at nine o'clock tonight. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1885.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1887.08s)]
*  Thank you, Mike Johnson. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1888.08s)]
*  Still to come after last night's voting debacle, Speaker Mike Johnson admits counting can be [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1889.08s)]
*  harder than it looks. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1894.36s)]
*  Last night was a setback, but democracy is messy. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1897.08s)]
*  We live in a time of divided government. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1899.24s)]
*  We have a razor thin margin here and every vote counts. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1901.16s)]
*  Sometimes when you're counting votes and people show up when they're not expected to be in [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1904.92s)]
*  the building, it changes the equation. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1908.12s)]
*  Where'd that plus one come from? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1910.32s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joins me on the Republican disarray in the House [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1911.76s)]
*  and what it means for the problems that actually need to get solved, which there are many of. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1916.0s)]
*  Ahead. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1920.04s)]
*  There's been a lot happening the last few days, but let's just go back for a minute [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1926.76s)]
*  to yesterday's defense on Capitol Hill. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1930.0s)]
*  It was a not so super Tuesday for House Republicans. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1932.72s)]
*  So remember, for months, they've been hyping this vote to impeach Secretary of Homeland [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1936.16s)]
*  Security Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1940.68s)]
*  Yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson took that to the floor and it failed. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1942.68s)]
*  They lost the vote by a single vote because Republicans apparently forgot about Texas [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1947.44s)]
*  Democrat Al Green, who just had abdominal surgery and showed up on the House floor in [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1952.64s)]
*  hospital scrubs in a wheelchair to vote no, along with all the Democrats and four Republicans. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1958.6s)]
*  And immediately after that, Republicans pulled off another impressive phase plan. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1965.6s)]
*  They immediately went into a vote on a standalone bill for aid to Israel, which they wanted [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1970.24s)]
*  separated out from funding for Ukraine and other national security spending they oppose. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1974.9199999999998s)]
*  And the plan was to pass this as a kind of symbolic gesture and then to chide Democrats [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1979.12s)]
*  for not getting on board. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1984.84s)]
*  But then that bill failed to pass. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1986.7199999999998s)]
*  And this one was not razor thin. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1988.3999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't even close. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1989.9199999999998s)]
*  It failed by 30 votes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1990.9199999999998s)]
*  Thanks in large part to Speaker Johnson's inability to overcome opposition in his own [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1993.16s)]
*  party caucus. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1998.0s)]
*  So now Republicans are talking about trying again to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=1999.64s)]
*  They want to hold another vote next Tuesday. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2004.96s)]
*  Why then? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2007.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, it's kind of a deadline. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  You see, that is the special election day in New York's 3rd congressional district where [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2009.72s)]
*  residents are voting to replace disgraced former Republican Congressman George Soros. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2014.48s)]
*  Remember that guy? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2019.3200000000002s)]
*  Santos won that district in 2022 by almost eight points. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2021.16s)]
*  But in the hard fought race to replace him, polling is neck and neck between Democrat [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2024.2s)]
*  Tom Swazi, who used to represent the district, and newcomer Republican Mazie Pillop. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2029.28s)]
*  And so on election day, House Republicans are going to be trying to use the last dregs [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2035.3200000000002s)]
*  of their dwindling majority for another impeachment vote. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2040.28s)]
*  And for this preposterous stunt, they already failed at once, in case Swazi wins on Tuesday [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2044.5600000000002s)]
*  and there's another Democrat basically in the House by Wednesday. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2050.7599999999998s)]
*  That's also among the reasons why the Democratic caucus is putting everything they've got [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2054.04s)]
*  into that race in New York 3. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2058.24s)]
*  I'm going to talk to one of the most prominent members of the New York congressional delegation, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, right after this break. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2064.08s)]
*  One of the challenges President Joe Biden faces in our current information environment [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2067.68s)]
*  and a Donald Trump media environment in particular is how to communicate just how much this administration, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2074.68s)]
*  Democrats and Congress have actually gotten done. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2079.84s)]
*  It's been a lot. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  For example, the last two years have been the most productive years for U.S. climate [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2082.2000000000003s)]
*  efforts ever. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2086.5600000000004s)]
*  We are still not on trajectory to meet our Paris climate targets, but for the first time, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2087.5600000000004s)]
*  it actually seems like we have a shot at making it almost entirely thanks to the Inflation [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2092.88s)]
*  and Production Act passed without a single Republican vote. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2097.6000000000004s)]
*  One of the people who first championed the early version of the climate plan as the Green [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2100.84s)]
*  Doon deal is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat in New York, and she joins me. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2104.6400000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you on. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2110.2s)]
*  One of the things that I encounter, I think, particularly in social media dominated spaces [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2112.56s)]
*  that where most people under 30 get their news is there's a really intense doomerism [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2116.3999999999996s)]
*  and negativity that just comes with the media more than anything. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2123.12s)]
*  I think it shapes people's views of politics. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2128.3599999999997s)]
*  When I tell people that emissions are setting all-time lows, solar deployment is setting [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2131.18s)]
*  all-time highs, people don't know that we've actually kind of had a pretty good few years [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2136.44s)]
*  on climate stuff. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2141.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it almost feels like when you remind folks of that they think you're [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2142.1200000000003s)]
*  being the buzzkill for the buzzkills, but it is important for us to communicate that [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  we are winning. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2156.1200000000003s)]
*  And this isn't just about a political context. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2158.76s)]
*  This isn't even about cheerleading the president, although his leadership and willingness to [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2162.52s)]
*  work and make climate a priority is important to note. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2168.56s)]
*  But this is really about a story of people's movements winning. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2171.94s)]
*  This is about frontline activists winning. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2177.24s)]
*  This is about young people, you know, like the Sunrise Movement, bird-dogging senators, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2179.7599999999998s)]
*  and making this issue front and center and completely politically unforgettable and politically [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2185.96s)]
*  urgent that we pass the largest U.S. federal climate investment in American history. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2192.64s)]
*  And that has translated already to nearly a quarter million jobs that have already been [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2200.2s)]
*  created of nine million jobs that are estimated to be created in the next several years. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2205.88s)]
*  I've got to ask you about just the Hill the last few days, because it really has been [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2212.6s)]
*  crazy and weird. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2217.24s)]
*  And just what you make of the Mayorkas impeachment and the fact that they're—you know, it's [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2219.36s)]
*  the first attempt to impeach a cabinet secretary in 150 years and they miscounted the votes [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2224.8399999999997s)]
*  and they're going to try again on Tuesday. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2229.48s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2232.52s)]
*  I mean, let's just call a spade a spade here. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2234.72s)]
*  Republicans are dealing with not their first choice speaker, not their second choice speaker, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2241.2s)]
*  not their third choice speaker. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2244.8399999999997s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2246.24s)]
*  They're dealing with the speaker that they could get and that they could agree on. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2247.24s)]
*  And that means an individual that does not have experience in party leadership, that [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2253.52s)]
*  is a relative newcomer when it comes to the tenure of member that you're used to seeing [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2260.72s)]
*  when they typically get the speaker's gavel. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  And that means that the experience in vote counting is not quite up to the standard that [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2270.92s)]
*  we usually see in a speaker's. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2276.36s)]
*  You're also dealing with the fact that this is an impeachment without merit. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2278.6s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas has demonstrated no—there is absolutely no evidence for an impeachable [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2283.48s)]
*  offense. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  It is completely politicized. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  It imperils the Republicans' own swing district members to force a vote on something so clearly [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2293.72s)]
*  craven and without merit that I think you see what happened last night, all of that [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2300.8399999999997s)]
*  coming together. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2307.12s)]
*  And the fact that they think that Democrats owe it to Republicans to give them, you know, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2309.0s)]
*  their counts, their attendance counts, is laughable. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2316.64s)]
*  It really speaks to the fact that you're working with people who are not used to being [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2320.52s)]
*  in this chamber. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2325.12s)]
*  Yeah, they were mad that—they were mad that Nildum told them that Al Green was going to [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2326.12s)]
*  become, like, wheeling back in scrubs from abdominal surgery, like you should have given [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2329.4s)]
*  them a heads-up on that. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2333.6s)]
*  And if you didn't expect Al Green to be doing that, then you don't know who Reverend [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2334.6s)]
*  and Representative Al Green is. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2340.0s)]
*  He will do that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2341.56s)]
*  He will do it, as demonstrated yesterday. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2343.28s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2345.0s)]
*  I want to ask a question about something—the Congressional Budget Office. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2347.24s)]
*  And you tweeted this because I've been maddened by the discussion of immigrants, which basically [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2352.4399999999996s)]
*  I feel like the entire discussion is they're coming to take your stuff, there's, like, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2355.9199999999996s)]
*  only seven slices of pizza in America, and everyone that comes is going to take one of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  those slices and you're not going to have any. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2363.7999999999997s)]
*  And the Congressional Budget Office basically said today, look, we're readjusting our projection [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  of GDP growth up by $7 trillion, and also we're reading the U.S. government money to [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2370.56s)]
*  reduce the deficit by a trillion because of immigration, higher-net immigration. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2379.32s)]
*  And you tweeted that being like, guys, we're not talking at all about the net positives [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2383.7999999999997s)]
*  immigrants bring to this country. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2388.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2390.48s)]
*  It is actually completely nonsensical that we do not talk about the enormous blessing, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2392.84s)]
*  economic blessing, that immigrants and immigration represents to the United States of America. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2400.96s)]
*  And a lot of folks sometimes think that this is just a certain kind of immigrant, right, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2407.4s)]
*  like college-educated or technical visas. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2412.52s)]
*  All immigrants that we're seeing—this is the CBO estimate. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2416.44s)]
*  is yielding enormous economic benefits to the United States. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2421.12s)]
*  And let's bring this out even finer. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2425.48s)]
*  If you are a caregiver, if you are a baby boomer, if you are someone that cares for [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2427.7799999999997s)]
*  someone who is aging, we currently do not have the economic or social structural capacity [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2434.6s)]
*  to take care of our seniors, and we will increasingly not have that if we, quote-unquote, lock up [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2442.12s)]
*  our border and shut down immigration. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2448.8s)]
*  In fact, the thing that has distinguished U.S. economic performance from other countries [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2451.6000000000004s)]
*  like Japan or other developed economies is the fact that our pro-immigration policies [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2456.8s)]
*  actually allow us to continue in our economic growth, whereas similar countries with anti- [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2464.6400000000003s)]
*  or more kind of closed-border policies experience economic stagnation when they submit themselves [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2470.6000000000004s)]
*  to this xenophobic, kind of border panic narrative that Fox News, frankly, seeks to peddle and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2478.2s)]
*  instill in so many people. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2484.52s)]
*  Quickly, in the last 20 seconds, I know you are a no on the supplemental for Israel, barring [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2486.2799999999997s)]
*  some sort of strings attached on that aid. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2491.16s)]
*  You said that we're seeing Gaza slaughter on a speech yesterday and the before. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2494.0s)]
*  How many Democrats are in that position? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2498.4s)]
*  Is there a rough count of how many nos there are in the caucus? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2501.2799999999997s)]
*  What I will say is that the grassroots activism around a bilateral ceasefire is working, and [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2507.12s)]
*  there are far more members than perhaps may be publicly visible that have a lot of trepidation [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2512.3199999999997s)]
*  around voting for an aid package that contains, A, no humanitarian aid, and, B, I think we [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2519.48s)]
*  are crossing the Rubicon here in just no-holds-barred, completely unconditional aid to the Israeli [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2526.3199999999997s)]
*  government. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2533.12s)]
*  We have the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2534.12s)]
*  U.S. aid laws on the books that prevent U.S. aid from funding gross human rights violations. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuNkMRD790&t=2553.8199999999997s)]
