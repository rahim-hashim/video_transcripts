# Hayes Zuckerberg and tech execs cozying up to Trump is chilling—but 'very clarifying'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. There is an actual real-life, not metaphorical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=0.0s)]
*  oligarchy coalescing around Donald Trump. You probably noticed. It's pretty unprecedented [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=5.32s)]
*  in the U.S. context, at least in the last hundred years, I think. Ominous in many, many [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=10.72s)]
*  respects. But it's also a genuinely clarifying development for the pro-democracy coalition [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=15.48s)]
*  as it prepares to oppose the second Trump administration. I think there's also a recent [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  historical parallel for this that's instructive. The George W. Bush years after 9-11. It's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=26.4s)]
*  easy to forget now that before September 11th, Bush was not an especially popular president. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  He of course had lost a popular vote, but won the election in large part thanks to his [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=37.44s)]
*  brother's state in Florida and a Republican Supreme Court that his daddy had helped put [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=42.64s)]
*  together. And all that changed on a dime after the attacks on America. Days after 9-11, Bush's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  approval had skyrocketed to nearly 90%. All of a sudden, everyone decided this guy was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=53.56s)]
*  a great, brilliant, courageous hero and the country was willing to get behind him. And [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=58.64s)]
*  you saw essentially the whole of American society falling in line behind him. From the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=62.72s)]
*  media to corporate boardrooms to the country music charts. And in some ways, as I look [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=68.76s)]
*  back on that and as I experienced it at the time, there was something clarifying about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=74.0s)]
*  realizing that you were in the dissident minority at the time where all the powerful people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=79.08s)]
*  were on one side and you were on the other side. And that minority, which I was part [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  of, was convinced that Bush and all the powerful folks siding with him were wrong and we were [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  right. History bore that out actually. Eventually, everyone would basically come around to that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=95.4s)]
*  view. By the time he had imploded the economy in the Great Recession after failed Social [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=101.16s)]
*  Security privatization and the debacle of Katrina and Iraq and WMD, Bush's approval [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=105.48s)]
*  rating bottomed out at 25%. And basically, everyone would just pretend they had nothing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=111.44s)]
*  to do with him, that they didn't write all these books about he was like the greatest [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  leader since Winston Churchill, etc. We are witnessing right now a similar moment, I think, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  after Trump's election. Though thankfully, I got to say, not as bad as post 9-11 America. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=128.08s)]
*  And let's hope we never have that again for a million reasons. There is something clarifying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=132.84s)]
*  about the Trump tech oligarchy coalescing around Trump. Even before the election, of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=138.48s)]
*  course, the world's richest man, billionaire Elon Musk, was inseparable from Trump. And [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=144.36s)]
*  his one-time PayPal colleague and fellow South African by birth, Peter Thiel, has been a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=148.4s)]
*  longtime benefactor to incoming Vice President, JD Vance. But things really shifted to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=153.6s)]
*  November. This week, Apple CEO Tim Cook went out of his way to donate a million dollars [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=160.12s)]
*  of his personal money to Trump's inauguration, an unprecedented donation for him. But it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=165.6s)]
*  matches the amounts given to Trump's inauguration by Amazon and Metta, the CEO of Uber, the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=171.44s)]
*  founder of OpenAI. In fact, Amazon's founder, billionaire Jeff Bezos, he's already been [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=175.76s)]
*  putting his finger on the scales at the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post. Last week, a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Republican political satirist in the paper drew up a cartoon lampooning all the tech [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=186.64s)]
*  billionaires prostrating themselves before Trump. You see a draft of it there. Pretty [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=190.32s)]
*  on the mark, kind of funny. That cartoonist ultimately quit her job after the Post killed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  that cartoon and refused to publish it. The following day, it was reported that the other [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=199.44s)]
*  part of the Bezos empire, Amazon, was paying a pretty head-scratching $40 million to license [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=203.76s)]
*  and stream a vanity documentary about Melania Trump. That seems like an insane amount of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=210.48s)]
*  money for that. But what do I know? Maybe it's going to earn it back. But then came [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=217.2s)]
*  the announcement today from Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  It's gone too far, says the founder of one of the world's biggest social media empires that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=240.48s)]
*  monetizes your attention at scale to make him incredibly incredible fortunes. He's announcing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=259.12s)]
*  he's ending content fact-checking, a practice they've done for years on Facebook, Instagram, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  and threads, and says it's about more free speech. Separately, Zuckerberg also just hired [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=268.88s)]
*  a new global policy director for Metta, Joel Kaplan, a Republican operative who served as [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=273.44s)]
*  George O. E. Bush's deputy chief of staff. There's Bush again. And a longtime critic of Metta's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=278.48s)]
*  fact-checking of political content. Zuckerberg also added a new member to the Metta board of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=283.44s)]
*  directors. Remember that guy, UFC CEO Dana White? He's a longtime Trump supporter and friend. He [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=288.56s)]
*  spoke at the RNC. That hiring did not sit well with a lot of Facebook employees who criticized [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=293.12s)]
*  the move internally and found that the free speech platform deleted their comments, according to new [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=299.36s)]
*  reporting by 404 Media. Now, it seems pretty obvious why you make all these moves to curry favor [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=303.68s)]
*  with the big guy and his political partisans. But it's also worth recalling why Metta had to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=309.44s)]
*  institute its soon to be former fact-checking policy in the first place. This has been totally [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=314.4s)]
*  written out of history. They didn't do all the fact-checking stuff out of nowhere. They certainly [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=319.44s)]
*  didn't because Mark Zuckerberg woke up one day and was like, we should fact-check. No, no, no, no. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=323.92s)]
*  Let's remember the history there. They did it because starting in 2016, the platform that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=328.4s)]
*  Zuckerberg founded, Facebook, was used to execute an ethnic genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=334.56s)]
*  by the military government of Myanmar. Tens of thousands of people were murdered in bloody and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=341.76s)]
*  brutal pogroms. Accounts of gang rape. People have to flee their village. Hundreds of thousands [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=348.64s)]
*  left homeless. As an in-depth Reuters investigation found, the hateful language and the calls for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=355.28s)]
*  violence that fueled the massacres were systematically promoted by bad actors. The poisonous posts [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=361.52s)]
*  called the Rohingya or other Muslims' dogs, maggots and rapists, suggest they be fed to pigs and urge [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=367.76s)]
*  they be shot or exterminated if this was being posted on Facebook. A United Nations investigator [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=373.6s)]
*  said Facebook was used to incite violence and hatred against the Muslim minority group. The [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=379.44s)]
*  platform, she said, had turned into a beast. Imagine having to tweak your product because you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=384.16s)]
*  realize that the libelous violent incitement on your platform spurred on the mass slaughter of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=390.16s)]
*  an ethnic minority. Again, I don't know if people remember this or not, but it was big news at the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  time. Zuckerberg was raked across the coals by senators in OP hearings on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=399.92s)]
*  That was when the Facebook billionaire realized content moderation was good or, if not good, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=405.44s)]
*  at least necessary. It was something he had to reiterate again after January 6th, not this January [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  6th, of course, January 6th, 2021, when it became obvious that Trump and his allies used Facebook [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=418.32s)]
*  to spread election lies and organize the rallies that would become a deadly capital insurrection. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  After that, Metta banned Trump from its platforms, a move Zuckerberg openly defended at the time, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  saying that Donald Trump had used their platforms to incite a violence insurrection, which is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  obviously not even a controversial claim he had. Now here we are, Zuckerberg's just, I guess, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=437.76s)]
*  memory wiping all of that, rolling it back. To placate the incoming president he once banned, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=444.0s)]
*  the top vector of disinformation in America today, an incoming president who just months ago wrote [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  that Zuckerberg plotted against him in the 2020 election and the Metta CEO would, quote, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=455.28s)]
*  spend the rest of his life in prison if he crossed Trump again. Do you think that perhaps [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=459.2s)]
*  swayed Zuckerberg? I don't know. Donald Trump, though, has a theory. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=464.08s)]
*  Do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=468.4s)]
*  Probably. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=473.11999999999995s)]
*  Now, there's no question that Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook all want to avoid the ire of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump. But I really think that that's only part of the story and we shouldn't just view it [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=479.2s)]
*  through that lens. These are billionaires who have class interests. They have empires of their own [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=484.24s)]
*  to preserve and expand. They see an opportunity for cementing a kind of tech oligarchy where the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=492.0s)]
*  leaders' favorite billionaires run the country. This is a model that exists in other countries. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=496.64s)]
*  They also look at their fellow billionaire bro, Elon Musk. It seems to be working for him. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=501.68s)]
*  Why shouldn't it work for them? Now, I think a country ruled by Donald Trump in like four [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=506.64s)]
*  or five billionaire tech dudes is a wildly dystopian vision that is fundamentally at odds [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=514.24s)]
*  with our commitment to self-governance and what most Americans would reject. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=520.32s)]
*  These are the anti-democratic forces of concentrated power and they are all lining in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=525.12s)]
*  the open in front of our faces. They're not pretending to do otherwise. It is chilling in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  its own way, but also very clarifying to have them all standing on the same side. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=533.6s)]
*  you [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UT0xxQM1M&t=544.08s)]
