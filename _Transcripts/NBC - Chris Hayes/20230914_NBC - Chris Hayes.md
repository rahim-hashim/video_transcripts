# ‘Disgusting’ Bernie Sanders reacts to comments from millionaire CEO, applauds unions
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4)
*  We are now closing out the most active summer for union organizing and strikes I can remember in my lifetime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=0.0s)]
*  You've got the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild both still on strike. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The Teamsters Union came within days of a nationwide strike against UPS and then struck a contract. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=9.28s)]
*  Today, probably the most legendary storage union in this nation, the United Auto Workers, faces a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=14.4s)]
*  deadline for reaching an agreement with the Big Three automakers. In just a few minutes at 10 pm [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=20.64s)]
*  Eastern, the union president is scheduled to tell his members which plants they will start striking [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=26.08s)]
*  if no agreement is reached by midnight. He sounds pretty determined in his speech to members yesterday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=31.12s)]
*  They could double our wages and not raise car prices and still make billions of dollars in profit. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=38.56s)]
*  They want to scare the American people into thinking that auto workers are the problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  We're not the problem. That chart is the problem. Corporate greed is the problem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=50.959999999999994s)]
*  And come tomorrow night, if they force us, we're about to make it the Big Three's problem. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=64.8s)]
*  He's scheduled to join the man you saw there, Sean Fain, UAW president, for a rally in Detroit tomorrow and he joins me now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=70.32s)]
*  Senator, do you have a, obviously I know you support the union, you'll be there with the union tomorrow, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=77.44000000000001s)]
*  do you have a kind of rooting interest here of the outcome you want to see? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the outcome I want to see is that the UAW workers get the kind of contract they deserve. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=86.64s)]
*  You know, the corporate media hasn't covered this very well, but the reality is over the last 20 years, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  real wages for automobile workers has gone down by 30 percent when you account for inflation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=100.48s)]
*  So what the workers are saying is at a time when the CEOs afford, he makes 21 million, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=106.56s)]
*  the guy who's head of Stellantis, he makes 25 million a year, the woman who's head of General Motors, 29 million, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=114.08s)]
*  their salaries have gone up by 40 percent over the last four years. They are billions of dollars for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  dividends and stock buybacks. And what the workers are saying is, hey, we made you those profits, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=127.2s)]
*  we gave you those salaries, pay attention to our needs. We don't want to see a situation where [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=133.04s)]
*  workers at the low end make it all of 17 bucks an hour. And I'll tell you something, Chris, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=138.48s)]
*  you mentioned that all over this country we're seeing strikes and you're right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=143.6s)]
*  And I think what's happening is working people all across this country are sick and tired of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  the corporate greed they are seeing every day. They see it when they go to the grocery store. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=153.2s)]
*  Food prices, incredibly high. Gas prices, incredibly high. Companies making money hands [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=157.6s)]
*  over fist. And I really applaud the courage of Sean Fain and the workers at the UAW for standing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=162.72s)]
*  up and saying, you know what, enough is enough. We need an economy that works for everybody, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=169.52s)]
*  not just the people on top. I want to just show some of the demands, UAW, 36 percent wage increase [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=174.0s)]
*  over four years. One of the things I want to do, this is actually a key one and there's a little [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=180.4s)]
*  in the weeds, but it's important for people to recognize, there are sort of these tiers that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  have emerged in successive rounds of organizing where newer workers aren't working at the same [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=187.76s)]
*  tier as others. It's a way of kind of breaking up the solidarity of the union. It's something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=192.24s)]
*  that Sean Fain has been opposed to and the folks that elected him. So we'll see how that goes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  I want to ask you this question on that context. We have seen all of this union activity at Starbucks [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=202.0s)]
*  and Amazon, the Teamsters and UPS, this, this. You said workers are waking up, but it strikes me that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=208.24s)]
*  part of the issue here is that you've got tight labor markets and employees have more choice now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=216.88s)]
*  than they did during that long period after Great Recession where you had a lot of slack in the labor [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  market, six, seven, eight percent unemployment. People were worried they were replaceable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=227.12s)]
*  It seems to me this environment has given workers more say and more power in their negotiations with [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=232.64s)]
*  ownership. I think there is truth to that, Chris, but I think it really goes deeper. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=239.6s)]
*  I think COVID, the pandemic, was a real emotional wake up for the American people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, the rich people, the CEOs, could stay at home and work in their fancy offices or in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=252.88s)]
*  their homes behind their computers. Working people, people at the UAW, bus drivers, people [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=258.8s)]
*  working in warehouses, nurses, doctors, they had to go out to work and tens and tens of thousands of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=266.08s)]
*  them died. And meanwhile, during that whole pandemic, we saw an explosion of wealth increases [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=272.56s)]
*  for the people on top. So yeah, the tight labor market is a factor, Chris, but I really think that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=279.36s)]
*  people are becoming sick and tired of the massive levels of income and wealth inequality that they [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=285.12s)]
*  are seeing today. No one thinks that three people on top should own more wealth than the bottom half [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=290.48s)]
*  of American society, that CEOs are making 400 times more than their workers. That's not what [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=295.6s)]
*  this country is supposed to be about. That's what the UAW is telling the American people, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=301.36s)]
*  and I think there's massive support for what they're trying to do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=306.24s)]
*  I want to play this clip that got a lot of play. It sort of went viral. It's a sort of random clip [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=309.2s)]
*  because it's just an Australian property developer. But what he's articulating at this conference with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  other property developers is a view that I think a lot of people in management or ownership at least [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=319.12s)]
*  have about exactly this awakening that's happened post-COVID, right? That people have this sort of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=324.16s)]
*  idea that they want to be treated with dignity, they want fairness. This is him saying we need [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=329.36s)]
*  unemployment to rise to knock the arrogance out of these workers. Take a listen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  We need to see unemployment rise. Unemployment has to jump 40, 50 percent, in my view. We need [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=339.44s)]
*  to see pain in the economy. We need to remind people that they work for the employer, not the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=344.16s)]
*  other way around. We need to remind people they work for the employer, not the other way around. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=348.8s)]
*  What do you think of that? I think it's disgusting, and it's hard to believe that you have that kind [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  of mentality among the ruling class in the year 2023. You know, this is the richest country in the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=358.8s)]
*  history of the world, and yet we still have 60 percent, 60 percent of our people living paycheck [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=365.76s)]
*  to paycheck. People can't afford housing. People can't afford health care. They can't afford [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=370.48s)]
*  childcare. They can't afford to send their kids to college. And what these guys are saying, hey, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=374.0s)]
*  this is all great working classes and disarray. Let's have more unemployment. We can get richer [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=378.0s)]
*  and richer. Make them more and more desperate. That is the kind of greed and arrogance that the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=383.84s)]
*  UAW and unions all over this country are standing up to. I applaud them, and I would hope that all [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  of us as Americans stand with the UAW in their struggle. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=397.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVqi8vzmr4&t=413.84s)]
