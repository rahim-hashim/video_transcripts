# Sen. Whitehouse: Trump's fate may be in hands of ‘MAGA-ized Supreme Court’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI)
*  Joining me now is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=0.0s)]
*  Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=4.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator, for starting us off tonight on all end. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=5.68s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=10.4s)]
*  What is just your first reaction to that schedule I laid out? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I know people wait for the NFL release and Major League Baseball releases, but I mean, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  seeing all of these trial dates laid out, how do you think that's going to affect the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=20.84s)]
*  ability for Americans to even concentrate on an election when one of the major party candidates [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  is very likely going to be walking in and out of court for most of the summer? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=32.56s)]
*  Well, I hope it sticks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=36.96s)]
*  You know, this is a real challenge for rule of law in the United States of America. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=38.64s)]
*  And rule of law shouldn't evaporate simply because a lot of voters decided to build a cult [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=44.68s)]
*  around a criminal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  That doesn't trump rule of law. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=53.8s)]
*  So every single one of these, the criminal cases, the fraud case, the defamation case, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  the separate related case about his immunity, Trump's immunity, all of that sets a really [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=65.76s)]
*  important set of historic questions for this country to answer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=73.2s)]
*  And many of them are going to end up in front of a very magaized Supreme Court. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=77.48s)]
*  You know, one of the things, Senator, in that recent legal filing by Special Counsel Jack Smith, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=82.64s)]
*  I cited this a moment ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=89.52s)]
*  His prosecutors go on to say this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=91.12s)]
*  I want to just read you this quote, get your thoughts on the other side. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=92.56s)]
*  Quote, the defendant asserts that this prosecution threatens to shatter the very bedrock of our [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=95.2s)]
*  republic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=101.04s)]
*  To the contrary, is the defendant's claim that he cannot be held to answer for the charges, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=102.0s)]
*  that he engaged in an unprecedented effort to retain power through criminal means despite [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=107.04s)]
*  having lost the election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=111.28s)]
*  That threatens the democratic and constitutional foundation of our republic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=112.72s)]
*  That's about as clear a message as we've seen from Smith's office. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=116.4s)]
*  You know, we're laying out, we know that Trump is a unique threat to American democracy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=120.72s)]
*  What do you think our government needs to do to make that clear to large amounts of American [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=126.0s)]
*  people who maybe don't see how dangerous former President Trump is, or perhaps even some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=131.44s)]
*  Republicans who for some reason seem less convinced of his danger today than they were two years ago? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=136.72s)]
*  Well, I think one thing is to have some confidence in the legal institutions of our country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=142.72s)]
*  You know, when a Dominion was getting harassed and brutalized by the biggest megaphone on the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  planet, the Fox News Organization, in an honest courtroom, they forced Fox to shut up and to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  write them an enormous check. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=163.92s)]
*  When the moms from Sandy Hook had to put up with this Infowars character pretending that their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=165.76s)]
*  children hadn't been killed and the whole thing was a scam, there was no way that they could stop [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=173.44s)]
*  his bullying and his noise until they got him into an honest courtroom. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  And suddenly he has to write them enormous checks and shut up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=182.0s)]
*  And so, and of course, Jean Carroll is another example of somebody who is going to be a victim [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  of bullying until she got into an honest courtroom. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=190.0s)]
*  So I think we can have some confidence that honest courtrooms can remedy some of the bullying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=193.2s)]
*  and the lies that is now endemic within our political system. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=197.92s)]
*  But at the end of the day, that gets you to a Supreme Court that has to be willing to follow [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=202.64s)]
*  the rule of law and not be subservient to political interests. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  Senator, with that in mind, the court, Chief Justice Roberts just quietly released their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=212.0s)]
*  end of year report. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Magically, it doesn't seem to talk too much about ethics or the massive, massive, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=218.48s)]
*  massive ethical lapses that we've seen brought forth by ProPublica and other outlets this year. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=224.32s)]
*  What can this government do? What can the Democrats do? What can President Biden do? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=230.72s)]
*  What should be done now to allow the American people to believe in the court again? Because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=235.2s)]
*  it is clearly a compromised institution, but will play a really critical role in the defense, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  hopefully, of our democracy over the next eight to 10 months. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=245.28s)]
*  Yes, an interesting dilemma, because on the one hand, the public isn't going to really [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=248.96s)]
*  understand what's going on at the Supreme Court until our investigation is complete. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=254.08s)]
*  Thanks to ProPublica and the New York Times and many people in your line of work, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=258.64s)]
*  the word about the scandals at the Supreme Court has come out that the Republicans are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=263.68s)]
*  determined to blockade our efforts to investigate it. We're equally determined to make sure we get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=268.88s)]
*  to the bottom of it. And getting those facts out there is going to be vital for the long-term [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=275.52s)]
*  credibility of the court. You have to get to solid wood before you start rebuilding, as any carpenter [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=281.12s)]
*  knows. And at the same time, this challenged court has to go ahead and continue to be a court [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=287.36s)]
*  and continue to decide cases. And I think they need to make sure that they're deciding these [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=293.04s)]
*  for real, following real rule of law, respecting precedent, and not turning into the captured court [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=297.76s)]
*  that many feel they have become. Senator, I always think this is really important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=306.48s)]
*  We're coming up on the three-year anniversary of January 6th. We're an unruly mob of terrorists, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=312.16s)]
*  I believe, under the guidance and being promoted by the former president of the United States, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=319.12s)]
*  attack the Capitol and threaten everybody's lives. I'm not saying this for fictional purposes, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=324.0s)]
*  but because I want the public to understand how dire and important these cases are. What do you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  think would have happened to our U.S. Congress? What would have happened to Mike Pence or Joe [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Biden if Donald Trump had been successful in January 6th? Well, clearly, Hank Mike Pence [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  was the champ that was echoing through the hallways of Congress. And men armed with weapons of a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  whole variety of kinds, including sharpened poles, were smashing things and creating damage. Many, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  many, many Capitol police officers and responding D.C. police officers were hurt. Several deaths [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=368.64s)]
*  resulted, and their purpose was to undo the transfer of power. Their purpose was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=375.92s)]
*  to prevent American democracy from working. So the idea that Trump is now defending himself [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=382.8s)]
*  as a champion of democracy and that these prosecutions shouldn't go forward for his [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=389.36s)]
*  effort to destroy democracy because he wants to be back on the ballot again, there's a terrible [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=394.48s)]
*  irony behind all of that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ren-s67fI&t=405.92s)]
