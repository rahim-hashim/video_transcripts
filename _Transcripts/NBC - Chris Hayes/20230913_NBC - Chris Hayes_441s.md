# Sen. Booker blasts GOP: ‘Morally obscenity’ of child poverty is a ‘policy choice’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw)
*  We have now proved something pretty phenomenal and at the same time pretty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=0.0s)]
*  obscene. And what we've proved is that poverty for children in America is not [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=6.36s)]
*  some accident, it's a policy choice. This moral obscenity of the richest nation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=13.52s)]
*  in the world having the highest poverty rates is not an accident, it's not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=22.8s)]
*  destiny, it's not inevitability. It is people in this institution making a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=26.36s)]
*  policy choice. People who made that choice to plunge millions of American [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=33.68s)]
*  children back into poverty are every single Senate Republican plus Democrat [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=38.76s)]
*  Joe Manchin who refused to extend the child tax credit. Today Manchin is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  defending that decision. Speaking to Semaphore Manchin quote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=47.72s)]
*  seemed unfazed when asked if today's poverty data left him with any second [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  thoughts. It's deeper than that we all have to do our part, he told them. The [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=54.32s)]
*  federal government can't run everything. Senator Cory Booker is a Democrat of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=58.76s)]
*  New Jersey and he joins me now. First let me just get your reaction. Everyone [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  was bracing, the people in the world of policy on this were bracing for what [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=68.8s)]
*  this number was going to be. And what was your reaction to seeing it? Not [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=73.34s)]
*  surprised. We knew what we had done and we're talking about child poverty tonight. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=78.48s)]
*  Know that this was the biggest middle-class tax cut in our lifetime, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=82.92s)]
*  Chris. So this was giving you know 85 to 90 percent of families in New Jersey [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=88.72s)]
*  tax breaks more of their federal tax dollars back. So this was an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=94.36s)]
*  extraordinary program and by the way it mirrors what our industrial competitors [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=98.2s)]
*  have. They keep their child poverty rates a lot lower because what they often [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=103.02s)]
*  call a child allowance is higher. America is the one that chooses to put [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=106.4s)]
*  such a financial strain on families holding a lot of their tax dollars. Now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=112.2s)]
*  this was a great program because it made it fully refundable which basically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=116.08s)]
*  means if you didn't earn enough money to pay that level of federal taxes you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  still got that anyway. And so it lifted millions of Americans children out of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=124.84s)]
*  poverty and helped so many struggling families who are still trying to figure [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=129.12s)]
*  out ways to make their kitchen table economics work. So this is outrageous [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=133.04s)]
*  that in this country we are favoring other kind of tax expenditures. Carried [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=137.72s)]
*  interest is something you've talked about a lot. For the wealthiest folks we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=143.28s)]
*  have a lot of little tax loopholes or tax breaks that we give them but when it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=147.12s)]
*  comes to something that is in the national interest like raising children [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=152.2s)]
*  above poverty line because it literally saves our economy. For every dollar you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=155.72s)]
*  invest in lifting a child above the poverty line you save over five dollars [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=160.76s)]
*  for our economy because children unfortunately below the poverty line [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=164.32s)]
*  have higher health care costs have lower lifetime productivity and the like. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=168.0s)]
*  There's just no justification whatsoever for allowing this policy to lapse. Yeah [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=172.2s)]
*  I just want to pull that graphic up again because it's so stark right. You [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=176.88s)]
*  don't you don't get signals amidst the noise this often in any policy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=179.76s)]
*  discussion right where you have like oh there's a bunch of confounding [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  variables and what really caused this. This is just there was a policy it gave [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=186.88s)]
*  80 percent of households with children money it was near universal child [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=191.16s)]
*  poverty plummeted now it has gone back up. Here's my question about the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=194.6s)]
*  political economy of this and I want to ask you a question about the sort of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=198.36s)]
*  moral insight that you had there. On the political economy there was hope that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=201.28s)]
*  this would be one of those things of how could you take it away right. If you did [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=205.32s)]
*  it for a year you know Manchin didn't want to do it for more than that let's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  see what happens if there would just be the kind of political energy behind it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  that would be impossible for anyone to vote to let it lapse. And and yet that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=218.08s)]
*  happened. What did you learn from that. You know it was a hard lesson a lot of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  folks said that once we get it out the door we'll get it we'll see this almost [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  50 percent cut in child poverty. All Americans at least upwards of 80 90 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  percent will see a benefit from it. But amidst a lot of the pandemic stimulus [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=234.28s)]
*  checks and a lot of the other things that were going on I saw a lot of data [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  that a lot of folks didn't know what it was or who was responsible for it. So I'm [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=243.52s)]
*  not sure if it developed the kind of political constituency you obviously [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=248.36s)]
*  should have right now in a time of of inflation and tight family economics. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=252.52s)]
*  Yeah I think also I mean my own theory on this is that because it was part there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=258.72s)]
*  was a lot of covid programs that were happening that people understood as [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  temporary as opposed to to you know long standing. So I think that probably [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  obscure things a little bit. Joe Manchin is really I mean again I don't want to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  take the pressure off the Republicans because they uniformly and unanimously [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=274.0s)]
*  voted against this even you know Mitt Romney or whoever your favorite [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=277.52s)]
*  Republican senator is. Joe Manchin is is the decider ultimately because he was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=280.76s)]
*  with you guys in the first year and not the second year. West Virginia's got one [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  of the worst child poverty rates in the country. You had conversations about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  this with him. You know this has been there's about six of us three house [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=293.52s)]
*  members three senators Sherrod Brown Michael Bennett that have been working [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=297.8s)]
*  on this for years and years and years. So of course I had a lot of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=302.12s)]
*  conversations with Joe Manchin as well as some Republicans about the urgency [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=306.0s)]
*  of this policy the fiscal prudence of this policy the moral urgency of this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=310.88s)]
*  policy but was not able to get anywhere. And now by the way we have data from [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=315.92s)]
*  this one year that's extraordinary including just the brain development of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Children you could see it affected because children in poverty have a lot [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  of cortisol pumping a lot of stress a lot of anxiety and it literally affects [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=330.2s)]
*  the way their brains develop. So we have a lot of compelling data. I have not [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=335.12s)]
*  given up nor has the sort of six of us that are fighting for this and we're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=339.36s)]
*  going to continue to try it. And one of the things we're going to say is often [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=343.52s)]
*  at the end of years they try to pass these big corporate tax extenders. And [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=347.08s)]
*  I know we send her time in Washington. Yes that's when it goes to town. Yes and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=352.12s)]
*  a lot of us therefore have a lot of leverage in the Senate and you know our [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=357.8s)]
*  team we're going to prioritize children and not just lifting children out of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=361.8s)]
*  poverty. This is going to help tens of millions of families with children have [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=365.6s)]
*  less financial stress and the stories about what people were using it for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=369.68s)]
*  helping kids get athletic equipment paying rent utility bills. Food was the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=373.52s)]
*  biggest thing people were using it for to feed their children. This is what we [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=378.92s)]
*  should want. Senator Cory Booker who has been working on this for a long time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  I've followed it reported. I know Michael Bennett and chair brown three [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=388.32s)]
*  you particularly have been for politically invested. I hope this is the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=391.44s)]
*  end of the road. I actually think there are this is not going away. So I'm [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  we're gonna stay on this as well. Yeah. Martin Luther King said it said child [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=398.68s)]
*  poverty is moral violence violence and it really is. So I just I have faith in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=402.6s)]
*  our nation. But thanks to you and others talking about this policy that a lot of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=408.36s)]
*  people don't know what child tax credit is. I want more people to know about it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=413.12s)]
*  more people beginning to demand that we do it again. All right. Thank you Senator. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=420.56s)]
*  Mhm. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7qfKuM9Bw&t=438.36s)]
