# ‘Fear not facts’ Target of right-wing ‘hate fest’ exonerated
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII)
*  So it's been a few days since the Republican response to the State of the Union. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=0.0s)]
*  By now, the performance of Senator Katie Britt has been roasted and panned by Democrats, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=4.58s)]
*  Republicans, SNL, pretty much everyone. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=10.58s)]
*  But beyond the spectacle of it, there's a very serious story of misinformation she included [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=13.18s)]
*  that night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=18.38s)]
*  Now she's being called out for it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=19.38s)]
*  In the speech, if you recall, Britt took the horrible, incredibly graphic and disturbing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=21.6s)]
*  story of a Mexican sex trafficking survivor from 20 years ago in Guadalajara in the interior [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=25.7s)]
*  of Mexico and tried to blame Joe Biden's current border policy for it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=31.9s)]
*  Britt was roundly criticized by journalists and by the survivor herself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=38.82s)]
*  In fact, I hardly ever cooperate with politicians because it seems to me that they only want [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=45.42s)]
*  an image. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  I think she should first take into account what really happens before telling a story [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  of that magnitude. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=55.06s)]
*  That was Carla Jacinto Romero with good advice that Republicans absolutely refused to take. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=56.06s)]
*  Her story, her horrible story, appropriated by Katie Britt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=62.1s)]
*  The twisted claims were wildly and grossly misleading. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=66.42s)]
*  She implied it was happening in the U.S. now because of Biden's border policy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  That's gotten a lot of attention. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=76.44s)]
*  It's dime a dozen when it comes to right-wing immigrant fear mongering. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  Remember this guy? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=82.5s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=83.5s)]
*  He's a migrant from Venezuela named Joan Buada. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=84.66s)]
*  He was the focus of the right-wing media's hate last month after he was accused of being [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  part of a gang that attacked NYPD officers in Times Square and then he was subsequently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=94.1s)]
*  photographed flipping the bird while leaving court. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=98.7s)]
*  And to be clear, when I saw that image and this story break earlier this year, I thought, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=101.74s)]
*  if I were a Fox producer or worked the New York Post, I'd be running with this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm a bleeding heart liberal and even I found this image provocative, let's say. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=110.98s)]
*  So did actual Fox producers who covered Buada in at least, get this, 84 segments over 38 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  days according to Media Matters. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=123.38s)]
*  We're caught on tape. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=125.22s)]
*  Given the middle fingers, they waltzed out of jail. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=127.78s)]
*  He's being let out of court yesterday on bail and he gives America, the press, everybody [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=130.3s)]
*  there, the double bird. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=135.78s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=137.94s)]
*  He strolls across the border, was given free shelter, beat up cops and suffered no consequences [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=138.94s)]
*  and this is how he thanks us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=143.82s)]
*  This guy coming out and flipping off the camera, really what he's doing is flipping off all [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=145.74s)]
*  of America. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=151.5s)]
*  The hate fest even went from Fox News to a political ad cut by a pro-Trump super PAC. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=152.5s)]
*  But then this month, guess what happened? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=159.34s)]
*  Manhattan prosecutors dropped the charges against Buada. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=163.3s)]
*  You know why? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=166.14s)]
*  They told the judge that further investigation proved that Buada, that guy who had always [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=167.3s)]
*  professed his innocence, did not participate in the attack in question. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  They misidentified him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  They got the wrong guy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  Not him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  Have you seen coverage of that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=184.38000000000002s)]
*  You think they've run 84 segments on Fox News about that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=186.58s)]
*  Of course, by then the man's life is upended. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  The myth of migrant crime had already become a roar on the right wing media machine and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  they will do it over and over again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=196.42s)]
*  Whether it's false rumors of a migrant caravan about to destroy America or the guardian angels [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  live on Fox, wailing on a man they claimed was a migrant thief when he was neither, he [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=203.54s)]
*  was an American for the Bronx who hadn't stolen anything. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=209.26s)]
*  That happened last month. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=212.62s)]
*  Remember all of this the next time you hear an immigration horror story out of Republicans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=215.18s)]
*  Aiming for fear, not facts. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiXYRBnneII&t=222.1s)]
