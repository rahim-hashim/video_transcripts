# ‘Alarming’: RFK Jr sought to stop Covid vaccinations 6 months after rollout: NYT
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4)
*  Tonight, an alarming new report on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the person Donald Trump wants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=0.0s)]
*  to put in charge of the country's health. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=4.2s)]
*  In May of 2021, that's just six months after the rollout of the code vaccine, Kennedy tried [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=7.32s)]
*  to stop all COVID vaccinations in the U.S., the New York Times reports. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=12.22s)]
*  He did this during a deadly phase of the pandemic when thousands of Americans were still dying [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=17.2s)]
*  every week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=22.42s)]
*  Kennedy's anti-vax organization petitioned the FDA to completely revoke authorization [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=24.46s)]
*  for the vaccine and refrain from approving any other code vaccines in the future. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=28.76s)]
*  Even though estimates have begun to show the rapid rollout of COVID vaccines had already [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=34.64s)]
*  saved about 140,000 lives in the United States. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=38.44s)]
*  Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, is on the Health Education Labor Committee, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=44.44s)]
*  which is one of the committees that will be holding hearings on R.F.K. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=48.36s)]
*  Jr. for Health and Human Services Secretary, and he joins me now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  Senator, obviously we've known R.F.K.'s position, R.F.K. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=55.4s)]
*  Jr.'s position on this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=58.32s)]
*  This is new news that this petition actually happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=59.92s)]
*  We've got global estimates that in that first year the vaccine saved the lives of about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  19 million people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=66.48s)]
*  What do you think this says about his qualifications to be the head of HHS? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=68.44s)]
*  Well, it only reinforces all of the doubts that have already existed about his candidacy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=71.92s)]
*  He's questioned the vaccine for polio. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=78.6s)]
*  He's questioned the vaccine for measles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=82.28s)]
*  And by inference, it also is mumps and all of the other diseases in our country and around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=85.76s)]
*  the world that in the past two generations, if they haven't been completely eradicated, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=93.0s)]
*  they've just been reduced down to a dramatically lower number each year that affects families [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  in our country and around the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=105.48s)]
*  And what Robert F.Kennedy Jr. has done is that he is putting a cloud over vaccines. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=107.24s)]
*  He's allowing for doubts to be raised in families' minds as to whether or not they should be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=114.44s)]
*  vaccinated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  The COVID vaccine, if it had not actually been distributed, would have led to another [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  800,000 deaths in our country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=127.72s)]
*  And here he had a petition to stop the distribution of the vaccine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  So from my perspective, this is just one further reason why 75 Nobel Prize winners have come [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=135.64s)]
*  out in opposition to Robert F. Kennedy's confirmation as the top health official in our country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=144.68s)]
*  And it's why this is going to be one of the most important confirmation hearings that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=152.52s)]
*  we have had in a generation in the United States Senate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=158.64s)]
*  To stay with us for a second, you talk about polio and other things. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=164.68s)]
*  One of the things that's so wild to me about this is that we actually lived through this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=168.48s)]
*  with COVID. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=173.6s)]
*  Like, people couldn't leave their homes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=174.6s)]
*  We were outside. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=177.12s)]
*  It was killing thousands of people a day. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=178.12s)]
*  And then the vaccine, the country got vaccinated enough that we didn't have that anymore, more [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  or less. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=184.4s)]
*  So here's my question to you in a technical sense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=185.4s)]
*  If you were the head of HHS and we had another pandemic, which I know no one wants to think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=188.2s)]
*  about that, but 100 percent could happen, like he would have the power to do things [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=192.8s)]
*  that would stop the development of vaccines for that virus, stop the deployment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  Like he would have very real power to make it impossible to vaccinate people, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=203.4s)]
*  I'm not predicting this, but if for the sake of this discussion, it was a bird flu pandemic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=210.0s)]
*  in our country and we needed a vaccine and we needed it to be distributed, we would need [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=218.16s)]
*  a secretary of HHS that was leading the charge that was out in front and recommending to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=224.16s)]
*  people, especially those who might be in the most vulnerable communities, that they take [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=231.68s)]
*  the vaccine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=235.84s)]
*  And instead, based upon his past history, I think it's pretty clear that he would not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=236.84s)]
*  be doing that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=241.38s)]
*  I think that could be raising questions about the safety and efficacy of that vaccine, which [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=242.38s)]
*  would be very dangerous to the communities which could be potentially threatened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=247.14s)]
*  That petition we mentioned before claimed the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=252.46s)]
*  that vaccines weren't necessary because good treatments were available, including ivermectin [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=256.7s)]
*  and hydroxychloroquine, which subsequently, through multiple studies, has shown to be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=261.14s)]
*  not at all effective at all. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=265.3s)]
*  They had already been deemed ineffective against the virus at the time in 2021. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=267.34s)]
*  There's been subsequent data, so this is just essentially nonsense. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=271.98s)]
*  You are... [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=276.1s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=277.1s)]
*  I said he's moving us away from acceptance of vaccines, acceptance of fluoridation as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=278.1s)]
*  a part of the healthcare culture in our country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=285.1s)]
*  And by the way, distracting us from what the real agenda of the Republican Party is, which [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  is to loot Medicaid, to loot the Affordable Care Act and all of the healthcare programs [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  for ordinary families, for poor families in our country to pay for the tax breaks of his [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=300.56s)]
*  billionaire buddies down in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=306.52s)]
*  That's what we should be debating, not the efficacy of vaccines. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=309.52s)]
*  And that's really at the heart of the problem of this Kennedy nomination. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=313.52s)]
*  We are being distracted from the real issues and the real agenda of the Republican Party, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  once again, which is to pay for the billionaire tax cuts at the expense of the programs, especially [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=322.4s)]
*  the healthcare programs, which the Republicans have always harbored an ancient animosity [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=328.04s)]
*  towards and to then use that money for the tax breaks for the rich. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=334.04s)]
*  So it's just absolutely the oldest Republican playbook. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  And unfortunately, Robert F. Kennedy not only helps to distract from that agenda, but he [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=342.6s)]
*  also advances a dangerous agenda for our country, which would further endanger the health of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=347.44s)]
*  ordinary families. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=355.3s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Ed Markey of the State of Massachusetts. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=357.26s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=359.52s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexen-b7dw4&t=360.52s)]
