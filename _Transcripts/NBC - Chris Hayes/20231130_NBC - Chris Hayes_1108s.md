# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We're under 50 days from the Iowa [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=0.0s)]
*  caucus where Republican primary voters will have their first shot to choose a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=3.44s)]
*  presidential nominee. The last time that most of the country went to the pool [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=7.24s)]
*  polls, we have big sort of national election, the 2022 midterm elections a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=11.4s)]
*  little over a year ago. And as you might remember, Republicans delivered a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=15.44s)]
*  pretty shocking underperformance in those elections, and it was an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=18.96s)]
*  underperformance that was particularly pronounced among the Trump aligned [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=23.0s)]
*  candidates. We saw this early in that election night, and it just kept going. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=26.72s)]
*  The Curry Lake in Arizona and the Herschel Walkers in Georgia and the TV [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=30.32s)]
*  Dr Mehmet Aziz in Pennsylvania. In short, MAGA lost big in 2022, and as a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=34.36s)]
*  result at the time, there was a real feeling that people understood that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=41.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's political potency had waned, that he was an albatross, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=44.84s)]
*  ergo would be a good idea to get someone new as a Republican standard [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  bearer in this election contest. And we might be in for a competitive Republican [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=52.56s)]
*  presidential primary in 2023 into 24. And that is why you saw so many [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=57.32s)]
*  candidates decide to run against Donald Trump earlier this year. Of course, now [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=62.32s)]
*  with the benefit of finding tonight, things have not really turned out that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=67.72s)]
*  way. The base still loves Trump, wants him to be the party's nominee. Florida [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis, who was, of course, widely seen as the most viable [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=75.88s)]
*  alternative to Trump, has delivered one of the worst campaign performances of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  all time, truly one of the most stunning cash burning operations in recent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=83.84s)]
*  American politics. At the start of this year, DeSantis was at least feasibly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  competitive with Trump in the polls. Look at that. That's a real race. By the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  time he announced in late May, much later than many observers thought he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=97.04s)]
*  should, Trump had opened up about a 30 point lead in the polling averages. And [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=100.72s)]
*  then in that time, the DeSantis campaign, the affiliated PACs, has spent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=105.6s)]
*  nearly $50 million on advertising, only to see his numbers sink even lower to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=109.24s)]
*  near single digits while Trump's lead widened to about 45 points. You're going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=114.16s)]
*  in the wrong direction, Ron. I think it's fair to say that this is not where [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=118.88s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wanted to end up. I think it has dawned on the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  non-Trump loving parts of the Republican Party. And there are those elements. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=129.24s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a sec. That there is one last chance, 50 days [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=133.76s)]
*  out from Iowa, one last chance for competitive primary, barring some huge [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=138.48s)]
*  unforeseen circumstances. Given the table as it is set right now, one last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=141.84s)]
*  chance to have it out over the future of what the party, the Republican Party, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=146.88s)]
*  and whether it is going to fully align itself behind the man who wants to end [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=150.8s)]
*  American democracy, or whether the Republican Party is going to continue to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=154.72s)]
*  be a party that's woven into the fabric of the Constitutional Republic. That's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=158.16s)]
*  the choice for the party. And the way to make that happen would be a one-on-one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=162.64s)]
*  contest between Trump's and former South Carolina Governor and UN Ambassador [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=167.48s)]
*  Nikki Haley. Anything other than complete consolidation of the non-Trump [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  forces in the race are only going to help Trump by splitting the vote. I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=175.6s)]
*  suspect that is at least partly why we've seen former Vice President Mike Pence [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=179.48s)]
*  and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott suspend their campaigns fairly abruptly, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  actually. Maybe other Republicans in the race, not named Nikki Haley, will take [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=187.76s)]
*  their lead. Now, it's clearly not a majority view of primary voting [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=192.04s)]
*  Republicans. But there is definitely a contingent of the Republican Party that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=197.88s)]
*  would like to, if they could, they'd like to move on from Trump. And these folks [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  are just not particularly well represented anymore. I mean, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=210.04s)]
*  conservative media is basically fully in the tank for MAGA. Most of the so-called [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=212.72s)]
*  never-Trump Republicans have essentially become parts of the Democratic Party [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=217.04s)]
*  coalition, especially in the Biden era. So there really is like no one out there [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=220.76s)]
*  in the world who speaks for this group of people. But they really do exist. I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=224.92s)]
*  mean, there really are literally millions of them. They show up in polling. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, around 20% of the Republican Party disapproves of Donald Trump. And [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  for these people who don't like the Democrats, they're not Democrats, they're [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=239.64s)]
*  conservatives, but who also don't like Trump, Nikki Haley appears to be their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=243.16s)]
*  best shot. In fact, we've seen a succession of headlines in just the last few days [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=247.32s)]
*  that demonstrate that dawning realization. Haley's affiliated super PAC spent almost [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=251.56s)]
*  $9 million on advertising this month. That's a lot. It's nearly as much as both [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=256.0s)]
*  Trump and DeSantis's PACs combined. You've got Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=260.04s)]
*  JP Morgan Chase, who's been talking up Haley to anyone who will listen, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=265.56s)]
*  including during an event earlier today. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=268.88s)]
*  I did come out and make a nice statement about Nikki Haley. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=272.44s)]
*  You did. You've been talking to Nikki Haley. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=275.12s)]
*  Yes, I have. Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, you know, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=276.88s)]
*  help Nikki Haley too. You know, get a choice on the Republican side that might [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=280.76s)]
*  be better than Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Also this week, it was reported that Americans for Prosperity, the infamous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=286.48s)]
*  political arm of the Koch network, would be backing Haley as well, which is a huge [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  development, providing her access to a near endless stream of dark money. Now, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=294.52s)]
*  the Koch political network run by Charles Koch, one of the richest men on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=298.6s)]
*  earth, has had obviously a relentlessly and profoundly malignant influence on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=301.6s)]
*  American life. In many ways, its unlimited supply of near untraceable money, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=306.88s)]
*  backing political movements like the Tea Party and then candidates, paved the way [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=311.24s)]
*  for Donald Trump, brought us to the moment that we're in. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=314.8s)]
*  And also, just to be absolutely clear, I really don't like at all Nikki Haley's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=317.96s)]
*  politics. I think it would be a bad thing for the country if she were elected [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=321.6s)]
*  president. She would pursue an agenda that negatively impacts the material [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=324.28s)]
*  conditions for working Americans nearly every way, from the climate to tax cuts [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=328.16s)]
*  to abortion rights. But and also, I don't think Nikki Haley would prove to be [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  an existential threat to the very framework of our representative democracy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=338.12s)]
*  like Donald Trump clearly would be and is. Listen to her at the first primary [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=341.72s)]
*  debate, dressing down candidate Vivek Ramaswamy over Ukraine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine is the front line of defense. Putin has said, if Russia, once Russia [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=352.0s)]
*  takes Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. That's a world war. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=357.88s)]
*  We're trying to prevent war. Look at what Putin did today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=361.36s)]
*  He killed Pergozen. When I was at the UN, the Russian ambassador suddenly died. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=364.6s)]
*  This guy is a murderer and you are choosing a murderer over a pro-American [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=370.28s)]
*  country. Now, that doesn't sound absolutely crazy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=376.4s)]
*  It's sort of, I don't know, like normal American foreign policy view with some [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=379.96s)]
*  that even Democrats have, right? And politics, at least in my view, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  particularly these days, is often about the lesser of two easels. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=390.48s)]
*  It's about harm reduction. Sometimes even it's about choosing the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=393.44s)]
*  bad over the cataclysmic. And from that perspective, it's just [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=397.92s)]
*  undoubtedly a good thing the COTE network is making this realization about Haley [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=401.6s)]
*  as the last viable option and this investment. It's a positive thing that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=406.0s)]
*  Wall Street executives are telling people they should back Haley for the good [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=409.8s)]
*  of the country. It is to the benefit of American [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=412.68s)]
*  democracy for there to be a strong faction of the Republican Party, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  one of the two major ones we have, committed to defeating Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=419.2s)]
*  And to be clear, they have a strong case to make. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=423.24s)]
*  I mean, it's been fairly well shown now that Haley would be a strong general [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=425.76s)]
*  election candidate. The polling reliably shows us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=429.96s)]
*  In fact, in lots of polls, she's the one candidate polling above Trump and head [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  to heads. She's got executive experience. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=436.0s)]
*  She's got foreign policy experience. More cynically, the polls show she's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=437.68s)]
*  a formidable nominee. Recent poll from Marquette Law School shows Haley [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=441.76s)]
*  beating Joe Biden by double digits, far ahead of Trump and Ron DeSantis. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=445.88s)]
*  And of course, there's also the element of poetic justice at play for the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Republicans. I mean, here's the reality. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  Nominating anyone other than Donald Trump would almost certainly rip the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=456.36s)]
*  party asunder. It might even break it in its current name and form. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Trump would then set himself to the goal of the total destruction of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  the Republican Party, just like he did against America as a whole, should they [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=467.96s)]
*  nominate anyone other than him. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=471.28s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, that's probably what the Republican Party deserves. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=474.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, again, if I'm writing the script here, I mean, do we destroy by the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=480.2s)]
*  monster they created and enabled for the better part of a decade? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  Nikki Haley included, as you know, from the open. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=486.52s)]
*  And they all know that threat hangs over them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=490.2s)]
*  So anyone who takes up the effort to defeat Trump, really, to really go after [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=493.44s)]
*  to try to beat him in this Republican primary anyway, deserve support. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=498.0s)]
*  If you have not been watching Fox News, you may not be aware of the drama and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=504.52s)]
*  intrigue they and the Republican allies have jimmed up around the president's son, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=508.04s)]
*  Hunter Biden. But you should know that while you have been following news on all [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  sorts of other topics, the Fox cinematic universe has been attacking President [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=514.96s)]
*  Biden and his son day in, day out, all day long. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=519.24s)]
*  Now, this line of attack could, in theory, at least be rather effective. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  The problem is they're working with very bad material and they keep running into [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=528.0s)]
*  absolutely humiliating dead ends. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=532.32s)]
*  Now they have hit perhaps the most humiliating one yet. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=534.84s)]
*  The right wing campaign against Hunter Biden has been going on for years, even [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=538.44s)]
*  before Joe Biden took office. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=541.08s)]
*  Biden's political opponents seized on his son's well-known and widely acknowledged [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=543.48s)]
*  personal problems, including his struggle with addiction, as well as his, like, you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=547.76s)]
*  know, foreign business dealings that a lot of people thought were not great in an [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=551.88s)]
*  attempt to disparage the president. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=556.0s)]
*  They built up a whole narrative about the Biden crime family and promised that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  Hunter was the key to bringing them down. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=562.64s)]
*  Amidst this scrutiny, Hunter disclosed in December 2020 that he was under [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=565.24s)]
*  investigation by the Justice Department related to his tax affairs. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=569.0s)]
*  Republicans then complained the DOJ was not charging Biden until they, well, did [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=573.0s)]
*  indict him this year on gun charges related to his drug use. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=578.48s)]
*  Now, to be clear, these are charges that many prosecutors and many defense lawyers [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=582.2s)]
*  who practice in the federal bar say would never be brought against someone without [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  that last name. This is a special case. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  Republicans were also incensed by the lack of a special counsel on the case. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  That is until Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel in [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  August. This year, House Republicans also launched their own probe into the Biden [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=601.84s)]
*  family, helped by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer of Kentucky. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=606.32s)]
*  They expanded that into an impeachment inquiry. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=610.12s)]
*  They didn't take a vote on it, along with two other committees in September. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  Comer and his teams have now spent months putting out a steady stream of anti-Biden [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  content, doing everything they can to promote an impeachment story and impeachment [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=620.88s)]
*  news segments on Fox, short of actually voting on impeachment for the president, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=626.0s)]
*  because, well, they don't have enough support to pass that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  Of course, a large part of what is driving all this is an instinct for revenge for the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=634.72s)]
*  two impeachments of Donald Trump. Trump has ordered them to impeach Joe Biden. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=638.84s)]
*  And, well, we know what they do when he orders them to do something. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=642.84s)]
*  So they want to even the score. Trump wants to even the score. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=645.68s)]
*  Facts be damned. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=648.16s)]
*  Now, this is the key point. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=649.8s)]
*  They have uncovered no actual evidence to support an impeachment of Joe Biden. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=651.3199999999999s)]
*  The inquiry has provided the House Republicans with a great opportunity to subpoena [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=655.36s)]
*  Hunter. Chairman Comer issued that subpoena earlier this month, summoning [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=659.28s)]
*  Hunter Biden for a closed door transcribed interview. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=663.52s)]
*  And now Hunter Biden has called their bluff. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=666.68s)]
*  Yesterday, through his lawyer, Hunter Biden told Republicans, sure, I'll come in [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=669.64s)]
*  and talk to you. And not just that, I will come in and testify live in public before [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  the whole committee. You know, you would think that would be precisely the sort of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=678.12s)]
*  dramatic confrontational moment Republicans have been waiting for. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=683.12s)]
*  They're trying to produce cable news for their friends over at Fox after all. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=686.28s)]
*  But instead of declaring victory and putting the date in ink, James Comer just [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=691.2s)]
*  folded, claiming a public hearing would not suffice. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=696.6s)]
*  We need to ask him hundreds of questions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=701.12s)]
*  If he comes in for one hearing with 24 members having five minutes each to ask [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=703.72s)]
*  questions with the Democrats yelling and screaming like they do every hearing, we [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=709.12s)]
*  would probably get about 30 to 35 questions in. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=713.5200000000001s)]
*  After years building up this climactic moment, the opportunity to grill Hunter [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=717.24s)]
*  Biden under oath in front of the country, Republicans retreated from their own [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=720.64s)]
*  battle. This has to be the most humiliating loss for James Comer yet. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=725.28s)]
*  And there have been a lot. I'll talk to his Democratic counterpart on the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=729.88s)]
*  Oversight Committee ranking member, Jamie Raskin, all about it next. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=733.72s)]
*  Last night, you might be shocked to learn shows here on this network. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  MSNBC covered the many legal threats Donald Trump faces and the dangers that he [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=744.88s)]
*  poses to democracy. We on this show covered both those topics across three [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=748.76s)]
*  segments. Now, it's hard to say what exactly triggered the ex-president last [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=752.68s)]
*  night, but clearly something he saw or heard prompted Trump to do what he always [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=756.32s)]
*  does, rant angrily on social media. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=760.24s)]
*  This was his post in which he attacks MSNBC. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  He misunderstands the difference between broadcasting cable, attacks the CEO of our [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=766.64s)]
*  parent company and then veers into this quote, our so-called government should [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=770.6s)]
*  come down hard on them and make them pay for their illegal political activity much [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=774.16s)]
*  more to come watch. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=779.76s)]
*  Now, these attacks are not new territory for Trump. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  It's easy to get bored with his whining. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=784.68s)]
*  I certainly am. But I will say this again in the theme of our coverage here so far, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=786.52s)]
*  as we head towards the election, this take this seriously. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=792.52s)]
*  I mean, he's telling you what he wants to do. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=796.12s)]
*  It's a man who wants to take power back, telling you what his policy on news [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  organizations he doesn't like is. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  He is very clear with his intent. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=803.8s)]
*  Our so-called government should come down on them hard and make them pay for their [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=805.16s)]
*  illegal political activity. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  And here's the thing. Yes, we have a First Amendment. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=811.16s)]
*  Yes, we got checks and balances, but with a determined enough government and the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  right henchmen in place. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you think for a moment that Trump's whining cannot turn into real punitive [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  action? Brian Stelzer is a media reporter and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=821.8s)]
*  He's author of the new book Network of Lies, the epic saga of Fox News, Donald Trump [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=827.36s)]
*  and the Battle for American Democracy, which is out now. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=831.4s)]
*  And he joins me now. It's good to have you here. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=833.92s)]
*  Thank you. Part of the thing that jumped out to me about this is that the idea of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  using the power of the state against your against a media outlet that you that's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  covering you in a way that you don't like is not an abstract idea. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=845.0s)]
*  In fact, there's some precedent here with CNN when there was an AT&T merger on the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=849.68s)]
*  table with Time Warner, that the Department of Justice intervened in. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=856.88s)]
*  Yes, I worked at CNN at the time before Election Day 2016. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=861.76s)]
*  Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that he would try to stop the deal from [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=865.8000000000001s)]
*  happening, stop AT&T from buying Time Warner. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=869.32s)]
*  And then once he was elected and once the deal was progressing through the process [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  through the government regulatory system, the Trump DOJ tried to block it, went to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=876.0s)]
*  federal court, giant lawsuit, delayed the deal by more than a year. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=879.52s)]
*  AT&T stood up to the president, stood up to the DOJ. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  Actually was willing to fight and they won in court. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=886.24s)]
*  They were able to win in court and the merger happened, but at great cost. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=888.36s)]
*  It delayed AT&T's battle against Netflix in the streaming wars. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=891.88s)]
*  And the broader point is that there is a significant amount of evidence that Donald [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=894.88s)]
*  Trump behind the scenes was trying to punish AT&T for owning CNN. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=898.56s)]
*  Again, this is like this isn't the like, oh, what if this is this is a thing that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=903.0s)]
*  happened. Here's the New Yorker reporting on this. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=906.64s)]
*  Jane Mayer talking about Gary Cohn being in a meeting whose Department of National [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=908.56s)]
*  Economic Council, according to well-enforced source, called Cohn the office and he said [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=913.6s)]
*  in exasperation John Kelly, then chief of staff, I've been telling Cohn to get this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=918.4s)]
*  lawsuit filed. Nothing's happened. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=921.56s)]
*  I've mentioned it 50 times and nothing's happened. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=923.0s)]
*  I want to make sure it's filed. I want that deal blocked. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=924.84s)]
*  Right. I want that deal blocked. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  He was also on the phone at the time, Trump with Rupert Murdoch talking with Murdoch [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=929.12s)]
*  about this. Rupert Murdoch then calls the AT&T CEO, Randall Stevenson, and says, hey, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=932.96s)]
*  you want to get a CNN off your back when I get CNN, I'll buy CNN from you, which I [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=937.4s)]
*  interpreted and wrote at the time was a favor to Trump to try to take CNN and put it [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=941.4s)]
*  in the cozy Trump hands. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=945.6s)]
*  Now, here's the thing I think that's so key about this story and the key about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=946.88s)]
*  understanding democratic decline, because we've seen this in other countries. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. The people at AT&T were like, we're not going to roll over. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=952.68s)]
*  That's right. Basically, for whatever reason, they stood up to Trump. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  They stood up to him, whether it's their principles, the dollars, play, whatever [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=959.4s)]
*  business. They said, no, the thing that we've seen in other countries is an erosion [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=963.52s)]
*  of that whereby you start to see people, the highest echelons of a society start to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=968.04s)]
*  play ball and start to be capped. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=972.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. Now, I've covered this parent network, Comcast, for nearly 20 years. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=974.12s)]
*  I know the executives at Comcast in Philly, they don't get rattled by a true social [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=977.7199999999999s)]
*  post. They have defended this news operation. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=981.12s)]
*  They've defended NBC for as long as they've owned NBC. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=984.24s)]
*  But we are seeing this with other media companies and we are, as you've said, seeing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=986.76s)]
*  it in other countries, in Hungary, in Turkey. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=990.56s)]
*  When the state comes in and takes regulatory action, takes legal action, uses an [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=993.16s)]
*  IRS, uses a branch of the government to punish a media company and sometimes to take [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=997.96s)]
*  that media company off the playing field. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1002.0400000000001s)]
*  It is a very real thing. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1003.84s)]
*  Yeah, that that kind of squeeze. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1005.4000000000001s)]
*  And again, to be clear, it's like, yes, the First Amendment's here. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1006.88s)]
*  But the way the squeeze has worked in places like Hungary, Turkey, and I don't think [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1009.44s)]
*  there is sort of robust democracies in America. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1012.32s)]
*  But even when they started is, oh, the IRS now has opened a case on your back taxes or [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1014.72s)]
*  there's new legislation that regulates entities that deliver an item to more than 10 [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1020.4000000000001s)]
*  million households every day. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1025.56s)]
*  It's like, oh, those are the newspapers. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1026.96s)]
*  And then lo and behold, you're paying fines and fees. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1028.8s)]
*  And then someone comes along and says, why don't I buy that from you? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll Rupert Murdoch. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1036.24s)]
*  Why don't I take it off your hands? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  Fix this person is a buddy of the president. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1038.56s)]
*  That's right. And Comcast, of course, is an infrastructure company. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1040.32s)]
*  They provide broadband to my home and tens of millions of others. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1042.56s)]
*  So you could imagine the ways Trump could try to turn the screws. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1045.16s)]
*  It's not just Comcast. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1048.04s)]
*  No, it's NBC. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1049.16s)]
*  It's still CNN. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1050.32s)]
*  It's still all of these players. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1051.56s)]
*  Look, on one level, Trump's post is just the weather, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1053.28s)]
*  It's stormy today. It'll be sunny tomorrow. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1055.68s)]
*  He'll rant about someone else tomorrow. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1057.76s)]
*  Yeah. On another level, though, it's a severe thunderstorm warning. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1059.24s)]
*  It's a warning about what he will do if he regains power. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1061.68s)]
*  And that's why I think it's more notable than when he was in power and tried to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1064.64s)]
*  punish AT&T or when he was in power and tried to punish the Washington Post owner, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1068.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, because back then he would tweet and say, boycott AT&T and nobody [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1071.64s)]
*  would care. The stock would go up that day. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1075.64s)]
*  It was it was meaningless. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  But this time it's a campaign promise he's making to his voters. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1078.1200000000001s)]
*  And he made one the last time on CNN and that merger. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  And he tried to hold to it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1084.84s)]
*  Brian Stelter. Always good to have you here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1086.52s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5XmgHP6EI&t=1087.8s)]
