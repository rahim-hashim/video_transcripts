# ‘I did the insulin’ Trump tries to take credit for bill signed by Biden
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo)
*  Wow, school lunch is up 65%. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=0.0s)]
*  How can a family afford that? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=2.6s)]
*  But look at this over here. What a nice job. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  I think I'm gonna take some of them back to my cottage [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  and have a lot of fun. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=9.3s)]
*  Like the Cheerios. I haven't seen Cheerios in a long time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=10.9s)]
*  I'm gonna take them back with me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=13.44s)]
*  Bacon is through the roof. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=15.44s)]
*  They're all through the roof. The milk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  That was millionaire Donald Trump doing the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=21.12s)]
*  Price is Right routine with a bunch of prop groceries [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=23.66s)]
*  set up in front of his private country club today, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=25.92s)]
*  ranting about the cost of stuff again [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=28.02s)]
*  and trying to tell everyone that the American economy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=29.62s)]
*  is in shambles, all while the stock market rocketed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=31.82s)]
*  through 40,000 at the same time on the lower right [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=35.32s)]
*  side of the screen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=38.32s)]
*  That there, the Cheerios riff, is Trump on message, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=39.92s)]
*  which is something his aides have been begging for, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=43.56s)]
*  like he was supposed to be yesterday in another [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=45.7s)]
*  rambling economy speech. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=47.7s)]
*  Trump very weirdly tried to claim credit for something [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=49.3s)]
*  Joe Biden definitely did as president, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=52.14s)]
*  saying that he's the one who did the insulin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=54.64s)]
*  Kamala and Joe tried to take credit for $35 insulin. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=58.54s)]
*  You know that. You know who did that. I did that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=63.18s)]
*  I did that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=65.18s)]
*  I did the insulin and it kicked in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=66.68s)]
*  And you know, I remember when I did it, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=68.88s)]
*  it had to be a statute. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=70.78s)]
*  It was a certain statute that took a certain period of time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=72.12s)]
*  I said, I hope I'm elected because somebody's gonna get [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=75.08s)]
*  a lot of credit for doing what I got done. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=77.72s)]
*  What are you talking about, my man? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=81.32s)]
*  Obviously not true. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=84.36s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Either lying or confused or some combination of the two. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Because check this out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden signing that piece of legislation, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=90.8s)]
*  a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=93.46s)]
*  which with no Republican votes, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  that gave Medicare the power to bargain down the price [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=97.7s)]
*  of a growing list of prescription drugs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Insulin was just the first of many. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, today, the Biden-Harris administration [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=104.9s)]
*  announced 10 more drugs would be reduced in price [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=106.9s)]
*  under the plan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=109.84s)]
*  Drugs that are taken by about 10 million Medicare [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=111.08s)]
*  recipients altogether. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=113.24s)]
*  In fact, the White House says these 10 drugs [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=114.86s)]
*  are among those with highest total spending [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=116.84s)]
*  in Medicare Part D. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=119.16s)]
*  Next year, whoever's in the White House will announce [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  another 15 drugs to be discounted [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=123.08s)]
*  under the negotiating plan. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=127.2s)]
*  has been championing this legislation for literally years [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=132.44s)]
*  And since you have been championing it, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=134.04s)]
*  I just wanna make sure I haven't lost my mind. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=136.08s)]
*  Donald Trump had nothing to do with this, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=140.52s)]
*  He didn't do the insulin? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=142.56s)]
*  Why, was that paying attention somehow? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=144.3s)]
*  Well, first of all, the words I did insulin, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=147.74s)]
*  it was a little alarming. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=150.28s)]
*  And then when you look through it, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=151.72s)]
*  he did claim credit for the $35 cap, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=154.68s)]
*  which is a complete and utter falsehood. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=157.26s)]
*  Back in 2020, he did some kind of volunteer program, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=159.82s)]
*  a voluntary program, not in statue. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=163.62s)]
*  And there was just a politifact check, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=167.0s)]
*  fact check on this a few weeks back, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=169.26s)]
*  and it found his claims to be false. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  Why, because as you said, Joe Biden [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  and the Biden-Harris administration got this done. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=177.12s)]
*  Not only did they get that $35 cap in place [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  that has also helped people who aren't seniors [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=183.8s)]
*  because it forced the drug companies [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  to volunteer, voluntarily offer it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  to people who aren't seniors and made a huge impact. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=191.56s)]
*  The other piece of it is that he got these 10 drugs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=195.24s)]
*  As you point out, eloquence, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=198.58s)]
*  over three million seniors take this drug, Chris. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  And he has gotten these drugs down [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=203.0s)]
*  as a result of finally passing my bill [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=205.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump never got done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=207.08s)]
*  We didn't get Republican support for the drug negotiation [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  when we passed it with all Democratic votes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  The fact is there are seniors right now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  that are gonna see a $1.5 billion decrease, billion, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=219.28s)]
*  in their out-of-pocket costs on just these 10 drugs, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Lirelto, Eloquence, Genuvia, Jardians, I've memorized them, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  and six other drugs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=231.44s)]
*  That is what we're gonna see. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=233.02s)]
*  And it means a lot to the American people, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=234.88s)]
*  15 more next year, 20 more after that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  And this was as a result of Biden-Harris administration, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=240.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris long, someone that took on the pharma companies [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=244.9s)]
*  on drug prices back to when she was agey. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  They're the ones that did it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=251.66s)]
*  And once again, we have a rambling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump press conference at his golf club [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  where it defies the facts, not true. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=257.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I know the cost of prescription drugs [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=261.64s)]
*  are a huge deal for everyone. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=266.02s)]
*  It always feels like, speaking of price of right, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=268.48s)]
*  it always feels like a lottery. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=270.86s)]
*  Like you walk up and it's like, I don't know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=272.62s)]
*  it's gonna be $10, it could be $180, it could be $560. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=274.82s)]
*  Like, do we just spin the wheel? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=279.02s)]
*  And so this has been a huge deal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=281.66s)]
*  But I think the political economy of it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=283.6s)]
*  and the reason that it's so important, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  both for what it means for people's pockets, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  like they're gonna pay less for drugs, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  but also like, just tell us a little bit about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=290.62s)]
*  how long it took to get to this moment [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  because I have covered this issue for 20 years [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=294.70000000000005s)]
*  and the drug companies obviously don't want it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=297.62s)]
*  because it's just a direct, it's directly, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=299.3s)]
*  there's the seniors on one side and the government [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=302.22s)]
*  and there's them on the other side [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=304.18s)]
*  and they want to charge more. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=305.36s)]
*  Completely, so about 20 years ago, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=308.38s)]
*  they got a sweetheart deal written into law. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=310.66s)]
*  I wasn't there for this, but they got it written into law [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=313.32s)]
*  that said that seniors, biggest drug buying block [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=315.8s)]
*  in the country are stuck with the prices. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=319.6s)]
*  So over years, led by myself, led by Bernie Sanders, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=322.24s)]
*  we have kept pushing this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=326.44s)]
*  And at the beginning, I had eight people on the legislation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=327.92s)]
*  Then we added more people, as I said, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  then Senator Harris was a strong supporter of this bill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=334.5s)]
*  We kept adding people and finally, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=337.6s)]
*  we get to the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=339.56s)]
*  We never got Republicans on the legislation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=341.5s)]
*  We finally get to the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=344.26s)]
*  pull two all-nighters to get that done, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=347.1s)]
*  and we finally get enshrined into law [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  thanks to President Biden [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=351.54s)]
*  and Vice President Harris's leadership. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=352.94s)]
*  We get enshrined into law the ability to negotiate. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=355.18s)]
*  Pharma companies had three lobbyists [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=357.86s)]
*  for every member of Congress. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=360.42s)]
*  They were behind every corner in the Capitol, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=362.1s)]
*  at every cocktail party, and yeah, it was hard. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=364.22s)]
*  And none, that did not pass during Donald Trump, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=367.14000000000004s)]
*  nor did the $35 cap on insulin, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=370.24s)]
*  nor did the $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket expenses [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=372.72s)]
*  that hits in January of next year for our seniors. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=376.8s)]
*  That all happened because of President Biden [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=380.56s)]
*  and Vice President Harris's leadership. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  And just to be clear, again, like this, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  you guys were flooded by pharma. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  There was a huge amount of lobbying and money. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  The deciding vote on this was passed by the Vice President. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the deciding vote on the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=395.36s)]
*  was cast by the President. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  It was signed by President Joe Biden. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=399.52s)]
*  There were zero Republican votes for this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=401.5s)]
*  And the reason that it's engineered, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  tell me if I'm wrong, in this way is because it was this, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=406.46s)]
*  I think, very clever means of sort of finding a workable, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  get to 50 votes way to do this over the opposition [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=413.9s)]
*  of the pharma company's tooth and nail. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=417.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would, right now I have legislation [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  to double the number of drugs [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=424.34s)]
*  that you see these kinds of cost savings, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  which drugs that are costing people in my state [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=428.52s)]
*  five, 600 a month go down to over 100. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=430.84s)]
*  It's an unbelievable change on monthly costs. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=434.4s)]
*  So I think we should be doubling our efforts to get it done. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=437.4s)]
*  But right now we must celebrate [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=441.76s)]
*  this incredible accomplishment [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=443.8s)]
*  because the pharma companies are fighting us in court [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=446.0s)]
*  as we speak. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=448.8s)]
*  There have been seven rulings on this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=449.96s)]
*  They have lost all seven cris, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=451.82s)]
*  including in front of Republican appointed judges. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=453.96s)]
*  So they're claiming that we don't even have the right [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=457.9s)]
*  to do this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=460.14s)]
*  The Biden-Harris Justice Department [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=460.98s)]
*  has correctly made the case we do one every single time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=463.5s)]
*  So even as we speak, they're fighting to take this down. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=467.18s)]
*  So I am just very pleased we finally got this done. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=470.62s)]
*  That is a great point about whether the Department of Justice [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=475.42s)]
*  continues to stick up this legislation [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=477.34s)]
*  should a Trump and Republican administration take over. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  That's something to watch. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=481.94s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=482.78s)]
*  thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=483.86s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=484.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5rSRn9JJo&t=487.88s)]
