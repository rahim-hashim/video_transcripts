# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 31  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a good situation, let's be honest. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=4.0s)]
*  This is a good economy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=7.4s)]
*  Sure a sign yet the economy is rolling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=8.4s)]
*  Donald Trump wants credit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=11.44s)]
*  I stand for everything that the stock market should be standing for and it's very important. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=14.08s)]
*  Tonight changing vibes and changing attacks from Republicans who can't run against the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=20.88s)]
*  economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=25.6s)]
*  He said that the reason the stock market was good was because of him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=26.6s)]
*  Republicans aren't stupid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=29.88s)]
*  And the case that an ineligible insurrectionist can't appear on a presidential ballot goes [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=31.56s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=36.56s)]
*  Plus what we're learning about who attacked an American base in Jordan and the substance [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=38.12s)]
*  and the side chef. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=43.58s)]
*  Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=46.84s)]
*  Senator, I'm Singaporean, no. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=49.16s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar on today's hearing on internet safety for children. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=52.4s)]
*  I just want to get this stuff done. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=57.36s)]
*  I'm so tired of this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=58.64s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=60.28s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=67.04s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=68.04s)]
*  It is 2024 and the American economy is back, baby. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=69.04s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=72.08s)]
*  As we've been covering for months on this show, there has been and is a gap, lingering [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=74.42s)]
*  gap between the way the economy is actually performing based on every metric we have, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=79.64s)]
*  well and the way voters say they feel about the economy, which has been quite pessimistic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  It every day brings some new bit of data that demonstrates that the American economy is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  roaring. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  Today, it is this chart, which you might call the GDP Olympics of all of the most developed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  economies on earth. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Which one do you think is growing the fastest? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=104.0s)]
*  Well, it's Joe Biden's United States by a lot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  That big green bar at the top is our GDP here in the good old US of A. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=110.92s)]
*  Do you see how much bigger it is than all the others? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=116.0s)]
*  The US is literally the best economy in the world. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=119.22s)]
*  Last year, our economy grew much faster than Japan, the second best economy, more than [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  double the rate of Canada and a distant third. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=128.48s)]
*  Not only that, but we are projected to blow the competition out of the water again this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  year. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=136.6s)]
*  And this is just one data point among many. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=137.68s)]
*  Wages in real terms, real wages, the amount of actual purchasing power are rising. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=141.76s)]
*  Inflation, by some measures, is falling below the Fed's target. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  With an anticipation, they may start cutting interest rates. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=150.04s)]
*  Investment in manufacturing has now set record highs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=154.12s)]
*  New business formation, that's people making small businesses, has set record highs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Old wealth has set a record high. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  And today, amid all this good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell got just about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=167.96s)]
*  as enthusiastic as it is possible for a central banker like him when discussing the state [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=173.32s)]
*  of the US economy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=178.68s)]
*  The labor market, 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=180.96s)]
*  We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4%. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=187.08s)]
*  That hasn't happened in 50 years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=191.88s)]
*  So it's a good labor market. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=194.04s)]
*  And we've seen inflation come down. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=195.72s)]
*  We've talked about that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=196.88s)]
*  So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=197.88s)]
*  to come. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=201.76s)]
*  So this is a good situation, let's be honest. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=202.76s)]
*  This is a good economy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  Just to be clear, for a Fed chair, that's the equivalent of stripping off your clothes [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  and twerking for three minutes straight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=213.28s)]
*  That's like, no one does that, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=214.28s)]
*  The last three years, the Biden administration has essentially, get this, put us back on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=216.84s)]
*  economically in a better spot than if COVID hadn't happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=221.52s)]
*  I want to say that again, okay? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  As the White House noted a few weeks ago, quote, the level of U.S. real GDP in 2023 [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=227.88s)]
*  even exceeded some pre-pandemic forecasts, including that of Congressional Budget Office [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=233.84s)]
*  and the IMF. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=239.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=241.52s)]
*  The economy did better last year than the economic projection showed before the pandemic, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=242.52s)]
*  before COVID. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=247.84s)]
*  But nobody knew there would be this cataclysmic event and recession in 2020. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=249.16s)]
*  Back in 2019, the Congressional Budget Office, for example, thought GDP would grow by an [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=254.68s)]
*  average of 1.7% in 2023. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=259.28s)]
*  Again, looking out into the future, not knowing there's going to be a pandemic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=261.68s)]
*  It actually grew at 2.5%. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=265.6s)]
*  And speaking of the pandemic, Trump and his supporters often argue it's unfair to compare [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Biden's economy to Trump's since, again, COVID tanked the world economy in 2020. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=273.82s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=278.4s)]
*  Listen to this, okay? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=279.2s)]
*  If you ignore 2020, Joe Biden was not President, Donald Trump was, but let's just throw it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=281.08s)]
*  out, okay? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=286.4s)]
*  If you ignore 2020, the economy under Biden is still doing better than Trump's was. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=287.12s)]
*  Take away COVID, give him a mulligan. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=293.8s)]
*  As the Washington Monthly notes, quote, under Biden, from January 2022 to December 2023, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=296.24s)]
*  employment grew at an average annual rate of 2.4% compared to a 1.5% rate under Trump [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=302.0s)]
*  from January 2017 to February 2020. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  So again, if you bend over backwards to give Donald Trump the most favorable comparison [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=312.56s)]
*  possible, where you completely take him off the hook for the economy tanking under his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=317.08s)]
*  watch when he was President due to COVID, and you ignore the first year of the Biden [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=321.44s)]
*  presidency when they had the huge boom as the world reopened, take that all off the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  board. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=329.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's economy is still whooping Trump's butt. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=330.56s)]
*  So the question becomes, if the economy is doing so well, why don't voters think it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=337.08s)]
*  is? And I think that's starting to change. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=341.4s)]
*  There are basically two reasons. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=343.76s)]
*  So one thing you've got to realize is simple partisanship. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  Republicans will never give a Democrat credit for a good economy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=348.52s)]
*  And while there's the same thing vice versa and reverse, it's asymmetric, which is to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=351.92s)]
*  say Democrats are more willing to give Republicans credit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=357.2s)]
*  So here's just one example. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=359.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of charts that look like this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=361.32s)]
*  Just days after the networks called the 2020 election for Joe Biden, there's a poll [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=363.88s)]
*  asking Democrats and Republicans how they felt about the economy going forward. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  And suddenly, in that red line, Republicans feel very pessimistic about the economy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=372.4s)]
*  Democrats start to feel better. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  This is before Joe Biden was even sworn into office. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=379.44s)]
*  But if you stay with this crap for a second, one thing I want you to notice there, the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  drop by Republicans is way more than the gain in Democrats. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=386.04s)]
*  You see that? Like, Republicans are way more partisan in their view of the economy than [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  Democrats, even though both sides are pretty partisan. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=394.92s)]
*  So that's one of the things going on. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  There's a chunk of the population that is never going to give pollsters a positive [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=400.72s)]
*  reaction to a Joe Biden or Democratic economy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  But for other folks who might not be very partisan or political, there's just a lag. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=407.8s)]
*  There is a lag between when the economy starts to improve in the numbers and when [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=413.36s)]
*  people feel it, when they feel more secure, that lag is starting to go away. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=417.48s)]
*  We're starting to see people catch up to reality. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=423.88s)]
*  You could see it in consumer confidence numbers, which are improving. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=426.12s)]
*  This is a problem for the Republicans because they want the economy to do poorly under [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=430.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=435.64s)]
*  You have an economy that's so fragile. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=437.6s)]
*  And the only reason it's running now is it's running off the fumes of what we did, what [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=439.96s)]
*  the Trump administration, it's just running off the fumes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=444.2s)]
*  And when there's a crash, I hope it's going to be during this next 12 months, because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to be Herbert Hoover, the one president. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=454.12s)]
*  I just don't want to be Herbert Hoover. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=456.52s)]
*  I mean, he kind of was Herbert Hoover because, again, he was president in 2020 when the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=459.12s)]
*  whole thing crashed. So he's already that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  Also, Lindell TV on Jan 6. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  Beautiful touch there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  So Trump hasn't gotten his wish with the stock market, even though he's rooting for it to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  crash. The stock market is booming. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  The Dow is setting record highs. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=475.36s)]
*  The economic recovery is so good that even Fox has to begrudgingly acknowledge it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=477.04s)]
*  Now, take a look at this headline in The Washington Post. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=485.8s)]
*  We bring it to you again because it was a kind of a standout. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=488.24s)]
*  It says falling inflation and rising growth gives the U.S. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=491.16s)]
*  the world's best recovery. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  Steve Forbes with me this morning. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=497.0s)]
*  I think the Democrats are going to run with that headline. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they're just going to plaster this all over the place. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  But are they right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  Is America does America now have the best recovery? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, yes, I'll bet that the next time KJP or the president takes any kind of questions [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  of any kind on the economy, that Washington Post article is going to be right there front [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=515.24s)]
*  and center. We've got the best recovery. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=519.4s)]
*  And that's a pretty good political slogan in an election year. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes, also helped by the fact that it is just plainly the truth. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=525.0s)]
*  So it's getting to the point where Republicans can no longer ignore reality, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=529.36s)]
*  Which is why instead of denigrating the economy, get this, Donald Trump is now trying to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=532.8s)]
*  take credit for it on social media, like from one day to the next, which, of course, is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  the Trump playbook. Anything bad that happens isn't his fault. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=541.88s)]
*  Well, he deserves credit for anything good under his watch. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=544.68s)]
*  It's something his press secretary noted when the first full jobs report of the Trump [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=547.56s)]
*  presidency was released. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=552.16s)]
*  In the past, the president has referred to particular job reports as phony or totally [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=553.36s)]
*  fiction. Does the president believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=559.12s)]
*  measure the economy? Yeah, I talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  him very clearly, they may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=567.52s)]
*  Ha ha, very funny. Reality doesn't matter. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=573.04s)]
*  Nothing matters. It's good when I say it, when I'm in power, it's made up when I'm [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=574.92s)]
*  not right. That's the whole thing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=579.76s)]
*  But this idea that Trump actually deserves credit for the Biden economy is just too [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=581.64s)]
*  ridiculous to reach most people, honestly, like some hardcore partisans are going to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=585.76s)]
*  be like, yes, it's a Trump stock market or whatever ludicrousness, but that's not going [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=590.12s)]
*  to work for most voters. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=594.8s)]
*  That is why Republicans are simply trying to just change the subject. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=596.4799999999999s)]
*  Change the subject. They love to talk about kitchen table issues and the price of eggs, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  all that stuff like six months ago. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=606.0s)]
*  Now, no, they are reaching for their political safety blanket, which is called [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=607.44s)]
*  immigration. That makes them feel safe when they're talking about immigration. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=611.84s)]
*  So right now they are trying to impeach the Homeland Security secretary the first time [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=616.7600000000001s)]
*  in 150 years to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, 170 years, because they get this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  disagree with his immigration policy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  They think he's not doing a good job and they're doing this in hopes that Americans [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=630.0s)]
*  will pay more attention to immigration, the economy. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=633.72s)]
*  And it's not a crazy idea. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=636.0s)]
*  There are some signs that might be working. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=637.6s)]
*  We've got some polling out today that indicates that voters are starting to care more [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=639.44s)]
*  about immigration than the economy, like, oh, the economy is fixed. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=642.72s)]
*  Well, I don't care about that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=646.0400000000001s)]
*  But even as Republicans try to get to to chase this shiny object, it's crucial for [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=648.52s)]
*  Democrats and also for just fair minded journalists and reporters everywhere not to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=652.9200000000001s)]
*  lose sight of the facts. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=656.6s)]
*  Again, setting aside politics ideology, just based on the metrics we have, we have a [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=658.44s)]
*  lot of numbers about the economy. It's the thing we measure basically more than [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=662.88s)]
*  anything. OK, President Biden has done the best job digging the economy out of a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=665.36s)]
*  deep hole that we have seen since FDR. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=670.28s)]
*  Joining me now is Stephanie Ruhl, senior business analyst at NBC News, host of the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=674.2s)]
*  Eleventh Hour here on MSNBC and someone who's been covering the economy a lot on [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=677.72s)]
*  your program. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=681.12s)]
*  I came here because I thought I was getting Jerome Powell stripped down and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=682.16s)]
*  twerking. I see none of that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=686.4s)]
*  I played it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=687.72s)]
*  And you just laid out the per you did all the economic news. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=688.44s)]
*  There's nothing left for me to do. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=692.12s)]
*  And you delivered me no twerking. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=693.24s)]
*  So I got nothing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm right that him saying I was sort of I couldn't get over that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=696.36s)]
*  clip because central bankers are very evenly measured. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  Markets move on adjectives they use for him to be like, guys. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=709.08s)]
*  Right. People measure every twitch of his nose, just like Janet Yellen last week [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=710.48s)]
*  kind of ran a victory lap. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, when it comes to the administration and Janet Yellen doing that, both of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=719.04s)]
*  these things are huge. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=722.68s)]
*  Now, Jerome Powell is not working for the administration, but he is signaling to the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=724.0s)]
*  markets. Yes, that rate cut is likely coming not today because he certainly doesn't [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=729.68s)]
*  want to be too early. But the administration is also realizing you laid it out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=735.0s)]
*  They've got all this great economic data. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=738.96s)]
*  They need to do a better job messaging this. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=741.24s)]
*  Yeah. And you said, listen, Trump does such a great job lying about it and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=743.88s)]
*  convincing people. Democrats need to do a better job talking about it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=747.36s)]
*  Look at oil production, Chris. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=751.16s)]
*  Why aren't we hearing from this White House? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=753.0s)]
*  We have we're producing more oil than we ever have in history. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=755.52s)]
*  Why? Because they don't want to piss off the food. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=759.48s)]
*  They don't want to anger the far left. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  Just like oftentimes in economic terms, Democrats should talk about a lot of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=764.92s)]
*  economic wins. They're often concerned about the people who are left out. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=768.96s)]
*  And I get that. But they have got to start running a victory lap because if they're [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=773.16s)]
*  worried about those people left out, they're going to be real left out if Trump [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=776.8s)]
*  wins. Well, first of all, let me just highlight the oil production. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=780.4s)]
*  I think and I might be saying I don't think that just we're producing more oil [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  than we ever have. If I'm not mistaken, the U.S. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=787.0799999999999s)]
*  is producing more oil now than any nation on Earth. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  Correct. And then any nation on Earth has ever produced. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=792.04s)]
*  Double correct. OK, I want to say that again. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=795.0s)]
*  The U.S. is currently producing more oil than any nation on Earth has ever [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  produced. Now, if you're someone who's worried about the climate, as I am, you [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=801.28s)]
*  hear that, you go, oh, that's not great. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's what I will say. That's true. Not great. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=806.12s)]
*  The theory of the case the Biden administration have is the only way you create [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=808.92s)]
*  the political sustainable transition is to keep oil prices low, because when they [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=813.24s)]
*  spike up, the politics on the issue go bananas. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=817.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a perfectly credible theory of the case, but they have to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  communicate it. And also, if you're going to put the carbon in the air, which [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=823.56s)]
*  we're doing, you might as well reap the political benefit as opposed to being [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=827.64s)]
*  hush, hush about a hundred percent in the same breath. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=831.28s)]
*  After Davos, my head was spinning that you kept hearing more and more CEOs [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=835.16s)]
*  kind of like open to this idea of Trump and a mad dialing people like, is this [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=840.04s)]
*  for real? And I learned two things. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=844.92s)]
*  A, it's listen, they have to play ball because there's no CEO of a fortune [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=847.16s)]
*  500 company out there right now who wants to be the next Bob Iger CEO of Disney [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=852.52s)]
*  with a politician gunning for them. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=857.4s)]
*  And they know there's the possibility it could be Trump and they don't want to be [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=859.08s)]
*  a target. But B, they're also egotistical and they like to be called. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And President Biden, while he has lots of winning policies, does not parade [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=868.24s)]
*  that around the world. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=872.76s)]
*  And I'm not saying that he should, but they like to get the call. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=874.2800000000001s)]
*  And one of them gave me this line that I thought was really interesting because I [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=877.84s)]
*  was like, look at this data. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=880.32s)]
*  How can you say he's not pro-business? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  And he said to me, you can tell a person's priorities based on their schedule. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't call us that. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=888.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that he should. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  By the way, I'm telling you, that's the site. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=892.1199999999999s)]
*  That is an amazing anecdote. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=894.0s)]
*  I also heard an anecdote of the time that Bill, that Joe Biden met Bill Ackman, the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  big hedge fund guy, and said about him, who is this a hole, which I think is a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=898.56s)]
*  funny thing I've never heard. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  That is a story that was supposed to stay in Vegas. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=903.92s)]
*  But like all stories didn't. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=906.8s)]
*  OK, so that's that what you just said is actually really important because part of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=908.52s)]
*  so there's two elements to this sort of gap that we've had so far. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=912.04s)]
*  One of the weird things is so there's a gap between people self-reporting how [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=915.5600000000001s)]
*  they feel about the economy and the numbers, but there's also this weird gap [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=919.36s)]
*  between people who were like CEOs. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=922.52s)]
*  You pull them, they're like all pessimistic. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=925.12s)]
*  There's going to be they got it all wrong. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=927.08s)]
*  By the way, they were wrong. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  Like they just were wrong about what happened. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=929.6s)]
*  But you would think that their bottom line matters more and they can't afford [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=933.32s)]
*  bias as much as someone further removed. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=938.36s)]
*  And it does seem to me like that class of folks, the people that watch business [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=941.0s)]
*  television, business reporters, business people are like, OK, yeah, it's a good [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=944.88s)]
*  economy. Am I right about that? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=948.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  They have finally been like, yeah, all right. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=950.28s)]
*  It's a good economy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=952.12s)]
*  It's a good economy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=952.92s)]
*  No, I mean, they're not shouting from the rooftops. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=953.68s)]
*  This is the best ever. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=956.56s)]
*  Because remember also, you run a big business right now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=960.28s)]
*  An empty office building. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=962.24s)]
*  OK, it's not like they do. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=962.56s)]
*  They get there's not an employee. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=965.56s)]
*  Where are these people? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=967.88s)]
*  They're going to be so nice to me all day. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=968.88s)]
*  This is an issue. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=971.56s)]
*  You know, they've got a good economy. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=973.4s)]
*  They're not going to say it is a bad economy. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=975.1199999999999s)]
*  It's a strong one. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  And you nailed it perfectly. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=979.76s)]
*  This is exactly why Republicans are pivoting to immigration. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=981.4s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=985.1199999999999s)]
*  If Republicans keep punting on this immigration deal, Joe Biden is going to show up [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=986.4799999999999s)]
*  with the receipts. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=990.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=991.4s)]
*  Say, I had a deal you wouldn't sign. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=991.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=994.2399999999999s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=994.68s)]

*  Coming up, the brand new filings on the case that could remove Donald Trump from the ballot. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=997.2s)]
*  But first, as the White House prepares some retaliatory action in the Middle East, Senator [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1001.44s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, the Foreign Relations Committee joins me on the increasingly perilous [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1005.64s)]
*  situation next. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1010.44s)]
*  The Biden administration is promising retaliatory action against the militias who claim [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1014.76s)]
*  responsibility for the drone strike that killed three American soldiers last weekend. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  We believe that the attack in Jordan was was planned, resourced and facilitated by [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1023.0s)]
*  an umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1034.28s)]
*  That is a tough day. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1037.16s)]
*  They killed American soldiers. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1038.68s)]
*  The president and I will not tolerate attacks on U.S. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1040.88s)]
*  forces from Iran, black terrorist groups or anyone else. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1044.4s)]
*  As President Biden has said, we will hold all those responsible to account at a time [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1049.3200000000002s)]
*  and in a manner of our choosing. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1056.04s)]
*  U.S. officials tell NBC News the plan is not finalized, but the targets are likely to be [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1058.76s)]
*  in multiple countries, and they are describing this as a campaign that could last for weeks. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1063.0s)]
*  Just moments ago, U.S. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1068.16s)]
*  Central Command announced American forces struck a missile battery in Houthi-controlled [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1069.28s)]
*  Yemeni territory. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  That's in a different part of the region that they said threatened U.S. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1075.08s)]
*  aircraft. This is the latest in the growing list of military actions across the region in [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1078.52s)]
*  recent months, all coming after the Hamas attack on October 7th and the Israeli bombardment [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1083.2s)]
*  of Gaza. Our ground invasion is now into its fourth month. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1087.72s)]
*  While U.S. senators have actually been to the region specifically, the RAFA border crossing [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1092.84s)]

*  He traveled to RAFA with Senator Jeff Merkley earlier this month. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1103.52s)]
*  He returned saying in an interview, quote, Things are not getting better. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1107.36s)]
*  And Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat from Maryland, joins me now. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1111.6s)]
*  Senator, it's great to have you on. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1114.92s)]
*  First, I want to get your perspective as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1116.76s)]
*  about the administration's stated intent to retaliate for that strike that killed three [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1120.84s)]
*  Americans against Iran-backed militias and what you think the sort of strategic aim should [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1125.68s)]
*  be here, what the consultation with the U.S. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1131.76s)]
*  Congress should be. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1133.6s)]
*  Well, Chris, it's good to be with you. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1136.68s)]
*  Look, I agree with the president that there have to be consequences to those who attacked [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1138.2s)]
*  and killed three U.S. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1144.84s)]
*  service members in Jordan. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1146.72s)]
*  The administration has also indicated that they know that the attack was planned from [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1150.76s)]
*  Iranian-backed militia in Iraq. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1157.1999999999998s)]
*  And so I expect that, as they've said, that you're going to see a retaliation. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1160.04s)]
*  I would say to the point you're making here, it's important that we hold those people [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1165.6399999999999s)]
*  accountable. It's also important that we don't fall into a wider war in the region. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1171.56s)]
*  And every day that goes on, the risks of a larger war that sucks the United States in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1178.8s)]
*  even more goes up. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1184.28s)]
*  I want to read two social media posts by your colleagues, John Cornyn and Lindsey Graham, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1186.8s)]
*  Republicans. John Cornyn said target Tehran as soon as the first initial reports came [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1191.3999999999999s)]
*  in. Lindsey Graham said hit Iran now, hit them hard. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1198.12s)]
*  What do you think about that kind of rhetoric? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1201.8s)]
*  Look, I think this kind of chest-beating machoism is what could lead to a wider war. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1205.36s)]
*  I think the response should be based on the intelligence. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  And we've been told by the White House that the intelligence points to these militias [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1214.2s)]
*  that are in Iraq right now. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  So I would I would caution those who want to trigger a much bigger war in the region. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1221.48s)]
*  We're already seeing the exchange of U.S. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1228.44s)]
*  forces with the Houthis. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1230.44s)]
*  There's a real chance that you could see escalation on the northern border of Israel with [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1232.16s)]
*  Lebanon and Hezbollah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  So look, the United States needs to follow through on what the president said. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1238.5600000000002s)]
*  Those who hit and killed Americans must be held accountable. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  How you do that matters. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1248.8s)]
*  You have been quite outspoken about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, specifically the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1252.0s)]
*  amount of aid that is or is not getting in. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1256.76s)]
*  Of course, tens of thousands of Palestinians have died since the Israeli assault in [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1258.6s)]
*  response to that October 7th Hamas attack. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1263.8s)]
*  There were at first total shutout off of anything coming into the Strip. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1266.96s)]
*  That's changed a bit. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  But at Rafa, you saw trucks that are not being allowed in. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1272.6000000000001s)]
*  There's multiple agencies, including the World Food Programming, Food Program warning [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1276.48s)]
*  that up to half a half a million people could starve. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1283.32s)]
*  Do you have any indication that situation has gotten better since your visit there in [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1286.48s)]
*  December? It has not gotten better. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1291.16s)]
*  And I say that based on conversations as recently as yesterday with the heads of major [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1295.68s)]
*  international non-governmental organizations that are working to get more assistance to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1301.44s)]
*  people in desperate need in Gaza. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1307.32s)]
*  The situation remains totally dysfunctional. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1310.48s)]
*  These are organizations, Chris, that have operated worldwide for decades. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1314.2s)]
*  And they say they've never seen a worse situation with respect to deconfliction, which [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1319.04s)]
*  is just a fancy word for making sure that those who are delivering aid can do it without [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1325.8s)]
*  getting killed, without a bomb falling on their head. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1330.8s)]
*  That situation remains broken right now. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1334.52s)]
*  You also have these big backups of trucks with a very cumbersome and quite random [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1338.68s)]
*  inspection process at a number of the Israeli checkpoints. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1346.6s)]
*  We went to a warehouse, the center, Merkley and I, that was filled with rejected items. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1350.36s)]
*  They included things like maternity kits to help deliver babies. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1355.6799999999998s)]
*  They included water purifiers. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1361.12s)]
*  They included a lot of things that while the claim was that they were dual use, they [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1364.24s)]
*  clearly were not. And here's the thing about it. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1370.4799999999998s)]
*  When a truck loaded with humanitarian aid gets turned back because there's one item [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1373.12s)]
*  that gets knocked off, the whole truck has to go back to square one, which can often [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  take weeks. So it's really important that we fix this [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1384.92s)]
*  broken system. I mean, we need to bring this war to a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1389.76s)]
*  close and bring the hostages safely home. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  But in the meantime, they need to find a better way to help desperate people in Gaza. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1397.44s)]
*  All right, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, thank you so much for your time. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1403.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you, Chris. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1405.88s)]
*  Still ahead, any whirlwind of legal troubles, the case that could remove Trump from the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1409.4s)]
*  ballot is about to be heard. And there are some new filings that are [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1413.12s)]
*  interesting. We'll talk about what's in them next. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1415.8s)]
*  Of the many legal issues that Donald Trump faces, which threaten his finances, family [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1424.52s)]
*  business and his freedom, the one that presents the most clear cut political peril is a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1428.4799999999998s)]
*  case the Supreme Court is going to hear arguments on next week. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1432.52s)]
*  It is the appeal of the Colorado State Supreme Court ruling that kicked Trump off the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1436.04s)]
*  Colorado primary ballot for violating the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1440.88s)]
*  holding office. The Supreme Court's decision on Trump's eligibility will obviously be [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1446.0s)]
*  enormously consequential, not least because Maine has also disqualified him from running. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  And there are similar efforts underway in at least 17 other states. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1456.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, in anticipation of next week's hearing, Colorado's Secretary of State just filed a [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1460.88s)]
*  brief that seems aimed squarely at the court's conservative majority, arguing, quote, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1465.4s)]
*  Just as Colorado cannot be forced to place on its presidential primary ballot a naturalized [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1470.04s)]
*  citizen, meaning someone who was not born a U.S. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1475.0s)]
*  citizen, a minor or someone twice elected to presidency, it also should not be forced [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1477.04s)]
*  to include a candidate found by its courts to have violated his oath to support the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1482.64s)]
*  Constitution by engaging in insurrection. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1487.28s)]
*  A. Scott Bolden, former prosecutor in New York, is now a white collar criminal defense [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1490.2s)]
*  attorney. Donya Perry served as deputy attorney general for the state of New York, as well [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1493.64s)]
*  as assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1497.32s)]
*  And both join me now. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1500.32s)]
*  Let's start with that argument that the Secretary of State of Colorado is making. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry. Go right ahead. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1506.2s)]
*  Well, just just because the state Supreme Court decision by Colorado very clearly was [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1507.44s)]
*  sort of aimed at Neil Gorsuch and aimed at the conservative justice on the Supreme Court [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1513.16s)]
*  because they knew it was going to get Supreme Court review, basically being like, look, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1516.84s)]
*  we're this is state like what we're doing here is a matter of interpreting the U.S. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1519.64s)]
*  Constitution, but also state law here. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1525.32s)]
*  And really, like you guys are really into the state courts and states figuring out [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1527.48s)]
*  eligibility. It seems like Jenna Griswold, the secretary of state, is doing the same [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1531.76s)]
*  in that argument. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1534.76s)]
*  Well, yeah. And the Colorado Supreme Court wrote this with a conservative Supreme Court [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1535.24s)]
*  in mind. It relied on state rights and it relied on strict constructionist and [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1539.32s)]
*  interpretation of the statute. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1543.76s)]
*  That is, Section 3 is self-enforcing. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1545.04s)]
*  As a former chair of the D.C. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  Democratic State Committee, I know this all too well because the states control federal [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1549.1599999999999s)]
*  and state elections. Who gets on the ballot and who doesn't? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1554.12s)]
*  And so how would you enforce someone keeping them off the ballot, as the attorney general [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1556.8s)]
*  said, if they had been twice elected president? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1561.9199999999998s)]
*  That would be a state right to decision. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1564.56s)]
*  The state would not put them on the ballot. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1566.8s)]
*  And there's nothing really different here other than they had a factual finding of [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1569.0s)]
*  that he was he was he participated in the insurrection, if you will. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1574.56s)]
*  So it's really not different. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1579.84s)]
*  And it was a finding the facts. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1580.96s)]
*  The 17 other states that are looking at this issue, some have made findings of fact or [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  two or three have. The others have gone through this kind of administrative process. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1587.0800000000002s)]
*  But once you make findings of fact. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1591.0400000000002s)]
*  In a state court with, again, an appellate review and due process and all that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1593.0800000000002s)]
*  With witnesses. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1596.44s)]
*  Remember, Trump didn't put on much of a factual defense, especially in Colorado and I [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1597.68s)]
*  think in Maine or some of the other jurisdictions. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1601.68s)]
*  They've just made these legal arguments that have left them wide open in regard to the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1603.92s)]
*  Supreme Court and how they're going to interpret it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1608.2s)]
*  And to note, also in particular, you mentioned Justice Gorsuch when he was sitting on the [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1610.24s)]
*  10th Circuit Court of Appeals, he specifically interpreted a in a Colorado case that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1615.48s)]
*  that a a presidential candidate has been a naturalized citizen actually could not be [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  on the presidential ballot interpreting the Constitution. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1630.32s)]
*  So in fact, that cited that very case is cited by the Colorado Supreme Court. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1633.96s)]
*  So we'll see these these strict constructionist, textualist, originalist, how they [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1638.68s)]
*  interpret this. Well, I mean, one of the sort of strange things about sort of unsaid [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1643.0s)]
*  here, this is like a great moment for legal realism, right? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1646.6000000000001s)]
*  Because like basically what we know is this. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1649.3600000000001s)]
*  The conservative Supreme Court are not going to let you kick them off the ballot. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1652.5200000000002s)]
*  They're not going to do it. They know what the outcome is. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1655.48s)]
*  And now the question is, how do they reach that decision? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1659.0400000000002s)]
*  What legal tool? And I thought this was interesting. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1661.48s)]
*  Rick Haasson pointing this out, that one of the sort of really narrow arguments that's [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1664.48s)]
*  been made against this section is that it says that, you know, you can't be an officer [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1669.36s)]
*  of the court, right? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1675.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, an officer of the United States, that the president is not an officer. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1676.9599999999998s)]
*  So Trump leads with a hyper technical argument. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1680.84s)]
*  He's not an officer of the United States for purposes of Section three. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1683.1599999999999s)]
*  They must have calculated a technical argument to be more appealing to the conservative [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1686.4399999999998s)]
*  majority than his other ones, such as an argument that Trump had the constitutional [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1690.08s)]
*  right to encourage his supporters to invade the Capitol. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1694.08s)]
*  So rather than saying, I'm not an insurrectionist, you say, let's not even get into that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1696.24s)]
*  I'm not even an officer. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1701.56s)]
*  A little bit of definitional like wriggling out. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1703.32s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1706.24s)]
*  I think it's a tough argument to make, but it does give these justices an escape [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  hatch. There was an interesting amicus brief written by a group of 25 very [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1712.6799999999998s)]
*  esteemed historians who and generally this is the kind of thing that the right wing [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1719.72s)]
*  group of originalists like to look at. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1724.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes, they examine the history of this of this clause and they looked at, you know, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1727.48s)]
*  what an officer means, what that means. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1734.12s)]
*  And they looked at, of course, the common definition. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1736.44s)]
*  You think of the president as a chief executive officer and they looked at, you know, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1738.44s)]
*  Andrew Jackson, who defined himself as an officer. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. I mean, it's just hard to history is complete with examples of the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1745.84s)]
*  president being understood by U.S. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1749.36s)]
*  law, both statutory and constitutional and courts as an officer. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1750.9599999999998s)]
*  Correct. But as you point out, if this court wants to find a way to get around [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  this, this is this is a way they might do so. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  Come on, guys. Come on, Chris. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1763.6399999999999s)]
*  If the president isn't an officer or the chief executive officer of the United [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1765.6799999999998s)]
*  States, which is a government corporation, what is he then? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1771.12s)]
*  Right. What is he some agent acting on his own? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1775.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. He's the commander of the military. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that that that dog won't hunt, as my grandfather used to say. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1780.6s)]
*  It's just not going to. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1783.6s)]
*  And the fact that they did not say whether he participated in the insurrectionist or [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  not as an insurrectionist is not is a way to avoid that ultimate issue. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1789.0s)]
*  Right. But they're going to have to find some look. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1793.0s)]
*  They're going to find some way to to overrule his decisions. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1795.76s)]
*  Well, the question is, what is it? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1799.24s)]
*  Well, I think what they're going to do, they could make that argument or they can [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1800.24s)]
*  make another argument that says because we don't know what an officer is or [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1803.24s)]
*  insurrection is, is defined, that it's up to the federal legislature to define it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1807.32s)]
*  But there are lots of sections of the Constitution that are self-instructional, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1812.72s)]
*  if you will, or define themselves. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1816.4s)]
*  Article three courts define the interpret the Constitution all the time. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1818.48s)]
*  That's their job. And that's the point that General Criswell is making, right, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1822.48s)]
*  where she says the constitutional amendment that bars a president from seeking a [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1826.0800000000002s)]

*  Exactly. Effectuate. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1837.32s)]

*  One thing to watch, though, and this is completely off topic a little bit, is what [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1841.48s)]
*  does Justice Thomas do? Does he recuse himself or not? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1844.96s)]

*  police say this crime happened last night. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1922.24s)]

*  to him as a traitor, calling for the death of all federal officials in attacking [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1958.6799999999998s)]

*  Now, we have seen this pattern of behavior before, obviously. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1991.36s)]
*  The man who viciously attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband had also fallen down an [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=1995.04s)]

*  fire inside a Washington pizzeria in 2016. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2003.68s)]
*  The big question in these cases that's very hard to unravel case by case is where [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2007.48s)]
*  the root of the problem lies. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2011.2s)]
*  Are people being exposed to this kind of destructive rhetoric online and becoming [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2013.28s)]
*  radicalized in ways that lead them to act out and violently? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  Or are people who just have preexisting issues grabbing onto this particular dark [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2021.0800000000002s)]
*  corner of the Internet? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  One thing that seems undeniable at this point is that the major social media [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  platforms have played a role in the proliferation of right wing radicalization. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2030.72s)]
*  They're also pretty lightly regulated, and we've got a constitution that protects [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2035.96s)]
*  speech and they want to remain that way. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2040.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of interest across the political spectrum in, well, changing [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2042.72s)]
*  that. Today, the CEOs of several top platforms faced a grilling by the Senate [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2046.72s)]

*  difficult, thorny issues that break down in interesting ways, not necessarily, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2129.04s)]

*  So let's be really, really clear about that. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2174.84s)]

*  Committee, this group of five, two of them are mine, are bipartisan. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  And then number three, they've always tried to divide and conquer, not doing it at that [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2233.48s)]
*  hearing between the parties. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2237.52s)]
*  They've always tried to say, oh, you guys are too dumb to know what you're doing. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2239.56s)]
*  That isn't true of the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2243.0s)]
*  And then they've said it's so esoteric. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2245.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not esoteric. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2247.6800000000003s)]
*  As one mom told me, taking on this when you have a number of kids and they're all getting [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2248.96s)]
*  all exposed to either eating disorder content or drug dealing, or they've got a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2255.04s)]
*  revenge porn going on or they send in a picture because they think they're going to [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  get a girlfriend and it ends up used against them in an extortion case. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2264.92s)]
*  As she said, it's like the faucet is overflowing of a sink. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2270.08s)]
*  And I'm out there with a mop by myself trying to mop it up. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2274.72s)]
*  That's how parents feel right now. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think that this is going to be the moment we've already passed these bills through [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2280.72s)]
*  committee where we can head to the floor and there's finally going to be some [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  accountability and some rules of the road when it comes to the protection of children. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2288.2799999999997s)]
*  So there's been there's a lot of back and forth on this. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2292.8399999999997s)]
*  And this is, again, a complicated area of policy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2295.12s)]
*  I want to talk about two areas. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2296.9599999999996s)]
*  One is age requirements and age minimums and who should be in charge of maintaining [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2298.3199999999997s)]
*  it. Personally, I think like you could just blanket ban anyone younger than 16 from [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2303.8s)]
*  being on social media. I mean, with that, like there's still the Internet. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2308.8s)]
*  You can still find out stuff like that. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2312.5200000000004s)]
*  That would be I think, you know, that's not what you're proposing. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2315.1200000000003s)]
*  But there's a question about for age minimums. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2318.0s)]
*  Who does it? And I want to play what Zuckerberg said today, which is basically, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2320.92s)]
*  look, don't look to us. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2325.1200000000003s)]
*  It should be Google and Apple and the people marketing the phones and apps. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2326.5200000000004s)]
*  Take a listen. Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2331.0400000000004s)]
*  I don't think that parents should have to upload an ID or prove that they're the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2333.1600000000003s)]
*  parent of a child in every single app that their children use. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2336.84s)]
*  I think the right place to do this and a place where it would be actually very easy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2340.92s)]
*  for it to work is within the app stores themselves, where my understanding is Apple [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2344.48s)]
*  and Google already or at least Apple already requires parental consent when a child [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2349.32s)]
*  does a payment with an app. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2354.32s)]
*  So it should be pretty trivial to pass a law that requires them to make it so that [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2355.84s)]
*  parents have control any time a child downloads an app. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2361.2s)]
*  So obviously, he's talking his book there. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2365.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to do it. But I also found it kind of persuasive. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2367.0s)]
*  Like, what do you say to that? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2369.4399999999996s)]
*  Sure. I am completely open to these ideas in terms of giving parents more control [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2371.0s)]
*  over their kids' lives. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2376.0s)]
*  But my point is the parents can't do all this. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2377.3999999999996s)]
*  These companies, his company and many others are making billions and billions of [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2381.16s)]
*  dollars off marketing to these children so they can get them hooked to life. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2386.2s)]
*  They have the ability to do this. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2390.68s)]
*  They have the ability to take these fentanyl-laced pills. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2392.84s)]
*  I think you maybe your viewers think I'm making this up. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2395.44s)]
*  Thirty percent of people that get fentanyl are buying it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2398.24s)]
*  Yes, it's coming through ports of entry and we're working hard on the security bill. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2402.92s)]
*  The compromiser trying to get done here to stop that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2406.96s)]
*  But they're getting it off of the Internet. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2410.12s)]
*  And I believe that they have got the ability to stop this content from going on their [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2412.36s)]
*  platforms and they are making money off of it. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2417.48s)]
*  They're focused on these kids. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2420.32s)]
*  And I, you know, when that door came off that plane, no one said they grounded 700 [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2422.12s)]
*  planes to check them for safety. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2428.8s)]
*  Luckily, no one died. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2430.8s)]
*  And everyone said, yeah, I get why you're doing that. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2432.16s)]
*  That's right. But yet these kids are dying every day. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2434.0s)]
*  They're committing suicide. They're getting fentanyl. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2437.12s)]
*  And yet people are just sitting and letting it happen. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2439.64s)]
*  And no one says, oh, maybe that mom that was sitting next to the kid on the plane should [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2443.64s)]
*  have done a better job of checking for the bolts. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  Look at, follow the money. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2451.0s)]
*  That's what we always said in our prosecutor's office. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2452.84s)]
*  Follow the money. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2455.56s)]
*  And the money has been going to them and their algorithms and how they are creating this [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2456.64s)]
*  kind of demand for this content. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2461.52s)]
*  And we could have a new world. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2463.36s)]
*  Some of it is giving parents the ability, but a lot of it is holding them accountable [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2465.04s)]
*  by allowing them to be sued, open the doors in the courthouse. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2470.96s)]
*  They are one of the only industries that is immune from any kind of lawsuit because [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2476.52s)]
*  this protection was put in place when they were little companies in a garage. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2480.88s)]
*  They are no longer little companies in a garage. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2485.2400000000002s)]
*  And that way, I believe if you put that in place and Lindsey Graham agrees with me and [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2487.96s)]
*  Dick Durbin agrees with me. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2493.2000000000003s)]
*  If you give people the ability to pursue these claims, they will change. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2495.04s)]
*  We will still have their great products, but they will change the way they do business. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2500.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2504.7999999999997s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, who was in that hearing today. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjZGI_LQD8&t=2505.08s)]
