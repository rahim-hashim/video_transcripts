# ‘It’s not over’: Colorado ruling is a warning to pro-coup lawmakers, says Ifill
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM)
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is the former president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=0.0s)]
*  Fund and the founding director of Harvard University's new 14th Amendment Center for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=4.64s)]
*  Law and Democracy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=9.96s)]
*  She also informally consulted on the Colorado case to disqualify Donald Trump for the ballot, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=10.96s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=15.5s)]
*  I don't want to make too much, Sherrilyn, of one poll that was a snap poll taken just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=16.5s)]
*  in reaction, but in some ways I think it's instructive because it's sort of a first thought, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=21.44s)]
*  best thought kind of thing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Like it comes down, what do you think? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  And I'm curious your reaction to that, saying that 54% of voters approve, 33 disapprove [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=28.66s)]
*  of a decision that I think in the mainstream discourse has been far more contentious. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=33.5s)]
*  Sherrilyn Yeah, thanks, Chris. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=38.46s)]
*  You know, of course I'm heartened that a majority of those polled said that they approved of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=41.9s)]
*  the decision. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=46.42s)]
*  The folks that you interviewed, that your team interviewed who said, you know, it won't [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  change my mind, it's just a setup, there's still just charges and all the things they've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=52.44s)]
*  said about the other cases involving President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=57.18s)]
*  You know, it's very much like what people would say maybe in the neighborhood next over [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=61.3s)]
*  from me about someone who was arrested and accused of being a drug kingpin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=66.66s)]
*  People who've seen that person in the neighborhood, who liked that person who handed out turkeys [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=73.26s)]
*  on Thanksgiving, who was a funny person and engaged with people, would say all of those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=77.44s)]
*  things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=83.86s)]
*  It doesn't trouble me that there are people who are saying I'm still with him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=84.9s)]
*  I think it's good that a majority of people are hearing this and feeling like there is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=88.26s)]
*  something there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=93.86s)]
*  The good news about Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is that it's easy to read. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=95.1s)]
*  There's really nothing confusing about the language. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=100.62s)]
*  That's my first reaction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  The second reaction, Chris, is I don't care. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=105.58s)]
*  We don't put questions of legality or eligibility for the ballot to polls. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=108.38s)]
*  These are the words of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=116.08s)]
*  We don't run a poll on whether if Donald Trump said he was 34 years old or if he didn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=120.34s)]
*  continuously live in the United States for 14 years, which is another requirement, we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=128.46s)]
*  don't put that to a plebiscite. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=133.1s)]
*  Those are the qualifications for those seeking this office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=135.42s)]
*  The reason it's so important, Section 3, which comes to us after the Civil War, is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=138.98s)]
*  that those framers, Chris, had looked insurrectionist in the eye. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=145.26s)]
*  They had faced a divided and broken country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  They had seen the ultimate in white supremacist ideology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=153.1s)]
*  Section 3 was included precisely because they understood the danger of these two strains [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  in American life to undo the possibility of the new democracy that was being created [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=163.62s)]
*  after the Civil War. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=169.46s)]
*  I think for the last five years, so many people have been throwing up their hands saying, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=171.22s)]
*  we've never seen anything like this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  What can we do to stop someone like Donald Trump? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=177.02s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=179.54s)]
*  We haven't had to deal with this since the Civil War. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=180.6s)]
*  Thank goodness, because most of our presidents, all of our presidents, save one, have not [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=183.3s)]
*  tried to overthrow the legitimate election of their successor. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=188.3s)]
*  But the framers of the 14th Amendment created tools for us to be able to deal with the possibility [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=193.34s)]
*  that there would be those who would be in this position. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  And the simple phrase tells us that what they're saying is that if you are disloyal to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=202.98s)]
*  Constitution of the United States, having once taken office and taken an oath of office [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  in the past and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or having provided aid and comfort [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  to those who did engage in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution, you are [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=220.46s)]
*  ineligible for public office at either the state or the federal level. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=225.38s)]
*  It's perfectly logical. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=229.7s)]
*  It's there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=231.38s)]
*  It was created by these framers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=232.38s)]
*  And I think it's very easy for people to understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that has been a recurring theme of this era is that Trump pushes against [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=238.78s)]
*  every boundary around him and sees how far he can go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=246.26s)]
*  And one of the things I thought about actually in the wake of this, and this has been occasioned [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  by a few people making this point, it is interesting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  We talk about the 34-year-old or someone who is not a U.S. citizen or not a natural born [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=257.86s)]
*  citizen. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=262.86s)]
*  Clearly, you couldn't put a 20-year-old on the ballot for president. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=263.86s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=267.5s)]
*  And the thought I had was, as you watch this sort of interesting, granular question of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=268.5s)]
*  actually work, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=273.58s)]
*  State by state and in Maine, the secretary of state is going to decide and in Colorado, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=274.58s)]
*  the voters can sue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=277.97999999999996s)]
*  And I had the thought of, well, what if someone, Donald Trump, for instance, wanted to seek [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  a third term? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=283.58s)]
*  Clearly, the Constitution says he can't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  And clearly, you could say, well, it would be anti-democratic to not have him on the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=289.26s)]
*  ballot. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=293.06s)]
*  I mean, the people should decide. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=294.06s)]
*  But no, actually, in the Constitution, we're just sorry, we're just clear about that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=295.06s)]
*  But then the question becomes like, right, when the rubber hits the road, if a certain [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=300.82s)]
*  person says I'm running for a third term, it turns out it's just going to be a test [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  of the same sets of institutions and laws, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=307.18s)]
*  Whether they can say no, you can't. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=310.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=312.9s)]
*  And this decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is incredibly thorough, goes through [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=313.9s)]
*  all the evidence. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=317.94s)]
*  This is a court that understands what the stakes are. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  It will head to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=322.02s)]
*  And as I've said in the past, this is really going to be a test for the Supreme Court because [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=323.86s)]
*  the plain text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is very clear. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  The findings of the trial court and the affirmation by the Colorado Supreme Court are very clear [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  and well-founded. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  The dissenters in the Colorado Supreme Court case dissent on grounds that have to do with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  Colorado state law. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=345.3s)]
*  And for your viewers who don't know, a state's highest court is the last word on the interpretation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=347.44000000000005s)]
*  of that state's local laws, that state's laws. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=354.22s)]
*  So the Supreme Court's not really in a position to overturn on the grounds that the dissenters [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  in the case dissented. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=364.42s)]
*  So this is going to be a real test for them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=366.1s)]
*  There are people who suggested that we're naive to think that they will do the right [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=368.86s)]
*  thing and uphold this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=372.22s)]
*  That's not really why we file cases. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=374.76s)]
*  I'm a civil rights lawyer. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=376.22s)]
*  I don't file a case thinking the Supreme Court's definitely going to rule my way. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=377.22s)]
*  You file a case because you have a legal claim that must be vindicated. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=381.06s)]
*  This is critically important. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=386.86s)]
*  We so often ignore the 14th Amendment when it is central to our ability to create a healthy [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=389.18s)]
*  democracy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=395.7s)]
*  And at our peril, we have ignored sections of it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=396.7s)]
*  We have distorted it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=399.42s)]
*  We have upended it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  We have used it for ends that it was not meant for. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=401.72s)]
*  But this section of the 14th Amendment was meant precisely for the occasion in which [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=405.38s)]
*  we would find ourselves now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=410.14s)]
*  And by the way, it doesn't just apply to Donald Trump. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=412.18s)]
*  I hope that all those other insurrectionists who are holding office or planning to run [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=414.58s)]
*  for reelection, I hope they're sleeping a little more fitfully after this Colorado [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=420.26s)]
*  Supreme Court ruling because it's not over. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=425.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=427.66s)]
*  And I should note here Judge Michael Ludwig, who has become a very vocal Trump critic and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=428.66s)]
*  was a sort of legendary conservative, real conservative jurist. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=433.62s)]
*  He was set on the Federal Appeals Court before he left. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=438.22s)]
*  He was in the short list to be a Supreme Court justice. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=441.38s)]
*  He says that he said it's the opposite of politics, this ruling, that the Constitution [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=445.18s)]
*  itself tells us that disqualification of the former president is not anti-democratic. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=449.58s)]
*  Rather, it tells us it is the conduct that gave rise to disqualification under the 14th [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=453.5s)]
*  that is anti-democratic. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=458.38s)]
*  The final question for you is on the second point here about the necessity of... [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=459.38s)]
*  There's the 14th Amendment, Section 3, and then there's also will the legal system be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=465.74s)]
*  allowed to run its course and have a full trial before a jury with full constitutional [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=469.92s)]
*  rights in due process of this man in times that people can judge who they are voting for. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=475.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=483.92s)]
*  So I want to separate this out because there are so many cases. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=484.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=487.64s)]
*  There is the criminal case. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=488.64s)]
*  We have Jack Smith's case. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=490.74s)]
*  We also have the LDF KKK case that got a huge boost today with the finding of telephone [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=494.0s)]
*  phone calls with Trump and Wayne County canvassers in 2020. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=501.04s)]
*  And so we've got a lot of different things going on that need to move through the system. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=506.32s)]
*  But this is still a test for the Supreme Court because they're going to have to make a decision [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=510.02s)]
*  about the very question that you're asking me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=514.16s)]
*  They have to ask themselves in a democratic system, don't the voters have the right to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=516.56s)]
*  know whether this person is in fact guilty of the crimes of which he's accused or not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=520.48s)]
*  before they vote in that election? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  Now the Supreme Court can engage in sleight of hand. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=527.96s)]
*  I mean, I could imagine them trying to resuscitate that Purcell doctrine that says we don't change [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=530.14s)]
*  things about an election too close to an election. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=535.46s)]
*  I mean, it would be outrageous to take a shadow docket decision and use it in this way, but [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=537.7s)]
*  it would not... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  I would not put it past them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  They may say on the Section 3 case that there needs to be enabling legislation by Congress [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  to remove someone from the ballot. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=550.22s)]
*  I mean, there are a million ways I think they will try to avoid this because, Chris, there [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=551.58s)]
*  is no way looking at the text, at the history, at the intention of the provision, at the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=555.38s)]
*  trial court record, at the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, that just on the legality, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  not on the politics, just on the legality, you could strike down that decision. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=567.34s)]
*  So that's the Colorado Supreme Court decision. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=572.48s)]
*  The other cases are those criminal cases that need to move. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  Jack Smith is trying to move directly to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=578.42s)]
*  I can't think of a rational or even legal reason why they would not accept that expeditious [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=582.38s)]
*  hearing and turn it back to the Court of Appeals. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=588.34s)]
*  And so I think the Supreme Court is in a tough spot. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=592.02s)]
*  Of course, they're the 800-pound gorilla. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=594.78s)]
*  They get to do whatever they want. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=596.38s)]
*  But every time they depart from what is plainly the correct legal course by the rules that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=598.14s)]
*  they have created and upheld, every time they depart from that, they further [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=603.66s)]
*  undercut their legitimacy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=608.06s)]
*  And they lay the groundwork for the changes that will happen to the structure of the Supreme [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=609.9799999999999s)]
*  Court in the coming years. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=616.26s)]
*  I'm sure those changes will happen, but they will happen more readily and with more public [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=617.38s)]
*  support the more the court is perceived as departing from its own standards and from [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=621.26s)]
*  standards of legitimacy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=627.52s)]
*  Sherrilyn Iffel, always a great, great pleasure to have you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=630.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=632.8s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=633.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xhE9k1ktM&t=638.06s)]
