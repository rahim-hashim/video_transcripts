# Trump taps Florida’s Pam Bondi for AG after Matt Gaetz withdraws
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today Donald Trump failed the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=0.0s)]
*  first big test of his second administration when Matt Gaetz withdrew [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=3.9s)]
*  from consideration for Attorney General United States. Trump's pick for the top [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=7.98s)]
*  job at the Department of Justice made the announcement this afternoon after [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  reportedly learning of a new allegation from the same woman who says she had a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  sexual encounter with Gaetz when she was a minor. Gaetz was already investigated [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=19.66s)]
*  by the Department of Justice for sex trafficking a minor, allegations he denies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=25.1s)]
*  Ultimately they chose not to bring charges. He has also been the subject of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  a multi-year investigation by the House Ethics Committee into accusations of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  sexual misconduct including sex with a minor which he denies as well as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=37.46s)]
*  illegal drug use. His confirmation was already looking like an uphill battle [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=41.46s)]
*  with more than a half of Senate Republicans saying they did not expect [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Gaetz to get the necessary votes and Trump wasted no time choosing his [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=49.22s)]
*  replacement. Tonight he announced he will nominate Pam Bondi, former Attorney [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  General of Florida. Bondi is a longtime Trump ally representing the then [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=56.98s)]
*  president during his first impeachment trial. He likes to put his own lawyers [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  in the Department of Justice apparently. She's also a Fox News regular even [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=64.38s)]
*  co-hosting an afternoon program while she was still serving as Florida's top [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=68.22s)]
*  lawyer. So we'll have to wait and see how Trump's second choice for Attorney [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=72.22s)]
*  General fares but this is important. He decisively lost his first fight and it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=76.06s)]
*  was with his own party and in doing so he proved that political gravity still [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=81.38s)]
*  exists. Donald Trump may have won more votes in swing states, he did, eke out a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=85.74s)]
*  plurality nationally, he did. That did not suddenly make him a brilliant [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  tactician and it did not convert the band of miscreants around him into [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  popular and confirmable figures. Choosing Matt Gaetz for this job was a dumb [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=101.14s)]
*  move. It was an unforced error. He is manifestly unqualified and as we learned [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  unconfirmable. Of course he's just the first. President-elect has chosen a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=113.54s)]
*  menagerie of figures for his cabinet, many of whom also face very serious [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=118.7s)]
*  accusations. There's Pete Hegsath who is accused of sexually assaulting a woman [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=122.54s)]
*  at a conservative conference in 2017. He denies the allegation. He says the sex [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=127.34s)]
*  was consensual. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused of sexually assaulting his 23 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=132.06s)]
*  year old babysitter. He's not exactly denied these allegations though he has [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=137.62s)]
*  said he is quote not a church boy. There's Linda McMahon sued for allegedly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=142.16s)]
*  enabling child abuse. She's called that lawsuit baseless. If gravity truly does [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  exist on this planet those are the sorts of things that would sink any [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=152.76s)]
*  presidential nominee. In fact a lot of people have gone down for far far less. I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=157.04s)]
*  mean the first major one of the modern era was Zoe Baird, Bill Clinton's first [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=162.4s)]
*  pick for that same job for Attorney General in 1993. The week before [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=167.6s)]
*  Clinton's inauguration a front page New York Times story broke the bombshell [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=171.48s)]
*  report that Baird had paid an undocumented nanny off the books. Bill [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=175.32s)]
*  Clinton's cabinet choices have been sailing through the confirmation process [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=181.88s)]
*  but now there are questions about Zoe Baird. That's his choice for Attorney [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=185.16s)]
*  General, the nation's chief law enforcement officer. She may have broken [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=188.92s)]
*  the law. Baird employed a Peruvian couple in this country illegally for almost two [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=192.92s)]
*  years. One is a babysitter the other is a driver. In addition to violating [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=197.72s)]
*  immigration laws Baird and her husband also failed to pay their employees social [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=202.0s)]
*  security taxes. Within a matter of days nanny gate seriously as it came to be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=206.36s)]
*  known had blown up enough to destroy Baird's nomination. The White House [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=211.72s)]
*  insists that Zoe Baird made the decision to withdraw but there's plenty of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=216.4s)]
*  evidence that she was pushed. The Clinton cabinet minus Zoe Baird was [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=220.12s)]
*  sworn in this morning at their first cabinet meeting the president said he [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=225.24s)]
*  was sad about Baird's decision. I feel very badly about it but I'm responsible [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=228.88s)]
*  for it and I'm gonna start this afternoon looking for an Attorney General. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=232.8s)]
*  Unfortunately for Clinton his woes continued with his next nominee for AGA [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=237.88s)]
*  if you believe it, Judge Kimber Wood who guess what also had a nanny problem as [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=241.52s)]
*  well as a brief stint training as a Playboy bunny. More than three months [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=245.96s)]
*  after his election Bill Clinton is still looking for an Attorney General [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=251.28s)]
*  tonight now for the third time. The White House tried to change the subject [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=254.32s)]
*  today but instead had to work overtime trying to clean up the Attorney General [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  mess. Clinton dumped Judge Kimber Wood as a prospective nominee for Attorney [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=262.12s)]
*  General even though she had paid all taxes on an undocumented nanny. So she [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=266.04s)]
*  paid the taxes unlike the first one still didn't make it. Now yes if you're [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=271.0s)]
*  gonna be Attorney General United States you should probably follow the law [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=275.28s)]
*  scrupulously but I guess I feel with today's hindsight and perspective these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=277.52s)]
*  were pretty minor offenses already resolved by paying back the relatively [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  small amounts of money owed. However the trend continued in a bipartisan fashion [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=287.32s)]
*  into the George W Bush administration. Linda Chavez today withdrew as the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=291.12s)]
*  nominee for Secretary of Labor after two hard days of stories about an illegal [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  immigrant who lived with her performing some work for cash back in 1991 through [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=300.68s)]
*  1993 when Chavez was initially interviewed by the Bush team she didn't [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=305.8s)]
*  tell them about the immigrant Marta McCarter of Guatemala. Same went for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=310.76s)]
*  former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Carrick in 2004. Bernard Carrick [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=317.24s)]
*  the man so many Americans remember from 9-11 in New York was nominated by the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=323.32s)]
*  president for a big cabinet-ranked job to run the Department of Homeland Security [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=328.08s)]
*  that is until it fell apart in spectacular fashion late Friday night. In [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  today's daily news a report of not one but two messy extramarital affairs one [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=337.76s)]
*  with the famous publisher of his autobiography Judith Regan. Carrick [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=342.88s)]
*  admitted the relationships adding I think that's my my personal business [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=346.44s)]
*  that's their business and I think it should stay at that. Carrick had said it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  was only his nanny problem that cost him the job but there were other issues even [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=355.52s)]
*  beyond his affairs. They include a past lawsuit for unpaid condominium fees that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=359.88s)]
*  led to an arrest warrant for Carrick a document Newsweek faxed to the White [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=364.72s)]
*  House Friday night and a past bankruptcy according to the website the smoking [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  gun. Now you might sense a theme here which is America's strange relationship [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=372.56s)]
*  to immigration in which people seem to depend a lot on the labor of immigrants [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=378.0s)]
*  undocumented immigrants but want to pretend those people don't exist but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=383.68s)]
*  perhaps the most nonsensical flops came at the beginning of the Obama [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  administration that's when Nancy Killefer lost a job over less than a $1,000 tax [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=391.2s)]
*  bill really and Tom Daschle was boned because of the free car rides he got [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=396.16s)]
*  from a wealthy friend. The day started when the president's nominee for the new [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=401.04s)]
*  job of chief performance officer pulled out because of a reported problem with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=406.44s)]
*  $900 in back taxes then came the other shoe the big one the man who was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=411.88s)]
*  supposed to tackle health care Tom Daschle and I deeply apologize took [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=417.92s)]
*  himself out of the running for secretary of health and human services for the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=422.76s)]
*  former Senate majority leader it's an enormous fall from grace the man from [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=427.24s)]
*  South Dakota who bragged in a campaign commercial years ago that he still drove [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=432.12s)]
*  his old broken-down car was caught not paying taxes on the use of a chauffeur [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=436.76s)]
*  driven car that he used to get around Washington for the past few years. So a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  rich guy loans Daschle his car to get around Daschle never reports that as [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=447.04s)]
*  income and therefore doesn't pay taxes on the imputed income of the value of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  the car. Again I think it looks pretty quaint in comparison to people like Pete [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=456.0s)]
*  Hegseth, RFK Jr. and Matt Gaetz and now it's undeniably good news that Matt [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  Gaetz will not be our next Attorney General but today's outcome does not [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=466.8s)]
*  relieve the pressure on Trump's other picks. In fact Republicans in the Senate [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=469.68s)]
*  again to their credit have made it clear they are not willing to publicly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=473.96s)]
*  humiliate themselves in the most abject fashion or manageable for Donald Trump's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=478.32s)]
*  wildly unqualified and unpopular choices. The fight is far from over. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=482.96s)]
*  you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SmVXsPziY&t=503.76s)]
