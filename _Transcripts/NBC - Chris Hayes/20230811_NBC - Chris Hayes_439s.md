# Hawaii wildfires reduce parts of Maui to ‘smoldering, toxic mess’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw)
*  Displaced residents of Lahaina on the island of Maui are still waiting to return home, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=0.0s)]
*  as we see images of the nearly complete destruction of their historic town from wildfires. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=5.28s)]
*  The destruction of Lahaina is especially hard because of the deep Hawaiian cultural history [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  it held. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=15.58s)]
*  In the 19th century, the town, situated on the island of Maui, served as the capital [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  of the unified Hawaiian kingdom before colonization. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=21.0s)]
*  Afterwards, it served as a cultural center, helping preserve traditional Hawaiian dance [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=24.44s)]
*  and revitalize the Hawaiian language. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=29.24s)]
*  On the courthouse grounds, an 8-foot banyan tree, planted in 1873, is now over 60 feet [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=32.04s)]
*  high, spanning nearly an acre. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=38.16s)]
*  Today, the entire town is burned to the ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  At least 67 people are confirmed dead, though officials say they do not know how many people [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  may have died in and around Lahaina, or how many people may still be missing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=48.84s)]
*  Nearly 2,000 structures burned down, including irreplaceable historical buildings. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=54.28s)]
*  But among the few things left standing is that banyan tree, which is smoldering and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=59.24s)]
*  damaged but still there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=64.28s)]
*  Brian Schatz is the Democratic Senator from Hawaii who shared these images from a devastated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Maui during his tour of the area yesterday, and he is here to tell us about it now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=70.8s)]
*  Senator, it's great to have you under awful circumstances. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=76.32s)]
*  And like I said to Senator Hirono last night, everybody I've talked to and seen is thinking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=78.88s)]
*  about folks in Hawaii and pulling for you and sending love and concern. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=83.92s)]
*  What did you see yesterday when you were able to tour the parts that were so devastated? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=88.8s)]
*  Thanks Chris for doing this, and thank you for your kind words. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  And I just want to thank everybody across the country and across the world for the solidarity [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=97.56s)]
*  and the support and the money that is pouring in, because this is a disaster ongoing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=101.68s)]
*  We are still in disaster response. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  We are not in the rebuilding phase. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=108.8s)]
*  What I saw was it was as though a bombing run had happened on Lahaina. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=111.8s)]
*  It's flattened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=120.92s)]
*  It is razed to the ground. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=122.44s)]
*  The sugar mill is intact. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=125.24s)]
*  The lighthouse is intact. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  The banyan tree is still standing, but it's unclear whether or not it will survive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=129.32s)]
*  Basically everything else is gone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=133.76s)]
*  We've got thousands of people now in temporary shelters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=136.04s)]
*  We're trying to restore power and telecommunications, but this is every bit as bad as the pictures. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=139.88s)]
*  We walk down Front Street and it is a smoldering toxic mess where it used to be this vibrant [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=146.64s)]
*  town of Native Hawaiians and Filipinos and Portuguese and Caucasians and tourists from [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=153.24s)]
*  all over the planet and people surfing and fishing and watching the whales and having [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=159.8s)]
*  a beer and dancing hula. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  And it is now what you see on the screen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=166.16s)]
*  So it's a devastating time for the people of Hawai'i and we appreciate the solidarity [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=169.68s)]
*  as we navigate through the next several weeks and months and years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=173.32s)]
*  So the next steps now, my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, the fire itself is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=179.24s)]
*  largely contained and not currently threatening folks, but what are the next steps in this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  emergency response? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a couple of things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  First, we do have a bunch of unhoused people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=195.08s)]
*  So we're working with FEMA to free up hotel rooms. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=197.26s)]
*  South Maui is still operational from a resort standpoint, so we're trying to free up enough [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=201.98s)]
*  hotel rooms to accommodate our local residents as we try to figure out a little bit more [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  of a medium-term temporary shelter situation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  And then today, teams from FEMA are arriving with dogs to do the final search and rescue [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=215.5s)]
*  of the people who were killed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=226.4s)]
*  So we're trying to figure out a way to get them to come back to the shelter. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=227.4s)]
*  And then we're also trying to figure out a way to get them to come back to the shelter [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=230.4s)]
*  and rescue the people who were killed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=235.4s)]
*  So we're trying to figure out a way to get them to come back to the shelter and rescue [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=238.4s)]

*  and rescue the people who were killed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=304.4s)]
*  You represent one of the most distinct special places on Earth [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=307.4s)]
*  and also one of the places on Earth probably most exposed to climate risk for a bunch of reasons. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=311.4s)]
*  This fire is the product of a lot of different confluence of things, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=318.4s)]
*  from invasive species to drought and other things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=321.4s)]
*  But you've been an outspoken climate hawk on this issue, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=324.4s)]
*  and how are you feeling about where we sit right now having just looked at this destruction yesterday? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=329.4s)]
*  You know, my old friend Neil Abercrombie, who was governor and I was lieutenant governor, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=335.4s)]
*  he said, you know, there's only one thing worse than being wrong in politics, and that's being right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=339.4s)]
*  People will never forgive you for being right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=344.4s)]
*  And I sort of feel like right now what we are seeing is the climate crisis in three dimensions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=347.4s)]
*  It is no longer a political question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=354.4s)]
*  It is no longer a polarizing question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=356.4s)]
*  It's just what's happening to the people on the island of Maui. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=358.4s)]
*  And we're seeing that increasingly in Colorado, in Arizona, in Washington state, in Oregon, in California. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=362.4s)]
*  This is our new reality. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=368.4s)]
*  So we've got to do two things. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=369.4s)]
*  First, we've got to understand that that reality requires that we manage our forests differently, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=371.4s)]
*  that we manage our resources differently, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=376.4s)]
*  and that we are prepared for an increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=379.4s)]
*  And secondly, although we took a big action on climate, the biggest action in the history of humankind last year, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=384.4s)]
*  it's not enough and we need to keep our pedal to the metal in terms of whatever we do next has to continue to lead to address the climate crisis. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=391.4s)]
*  But that's not going to deal with wildfires next summer. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=400.4s)]
*  That's not going to deal with droughts and floods next summer. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=403.4s)]
*  And so we've also got to beef up our emergency management and disaster recovery. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=406.4s)]
*  Senator Brian Schatz on the Hawaiian Islands, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=411.4s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=416.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Ubj6qrbOw&t=421.4s)]
