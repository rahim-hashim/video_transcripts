# Bombshell NYT report reveals ‘trail of payments’ from Gaetz to women
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo)
*  The Republican-led House Ethics Committee declined to release its report into former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=5.2s)]
*  But tonight, we have new reporting on the allegations that Donald Trump's pick for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=6.48s)]
*  attorney general paid women for sex while in Congress. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=9.96s)]
*  An investigative report in The New York Times, which has not been confirmed by NBC News, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=12.84s)]
*  contains a document apparently from the Justice Department that Gaetz wants to run. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=16.56s)]
*  The document, quote, established a trail of payments from Gaetz to women, including some [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=20.68s)]
*  who testified that Gaetz hired them for sex. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  The document itself is heavily redacted, a bit difficult to parse, but you can see the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=27.74s)]
*  gist of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=31.38s)]
*  It maps out lots of payments that Gaetz and an associate made to women, lots of them, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  including the Times says the two women whose lawyer told NBC News that they testified themselves [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=37.9s)]
*  before the House Ethics Committee that they had had sex with Gaetz in exchange for money. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=43.42s)]
*  Gaetz denies those allegations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=48.26s)]
*  In response, a spokesperson for Donald Trump told the Times in part, this purposeful leaking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=50.26s)]
*  of classified and investigative materials is a sort of politicized DOJ weaponization [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=54.94s)]
*  that Matt Gaetz will end. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=59.26s)]
*  New York Times notes the document had no classified markings and does not relate to national security. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=61.42s)]
*  Michael Schmidt is the investigative reporter who broke this story at The New York Times, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=65.98s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=69.74s)]
*  Michael, we've known, well, I just want to set the table here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=71.06s)]
*  We've known that there was a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, and we've known that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=74.22s)]
*  there was some sort of DOJ investigation into Gaetz. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=77.62s)]
*  We've known that there have been allegations of paying for sex and specifically having [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=81.02s)]
*  sex with a minor. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=88.38s)]
*  He denies all this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=91.14s)]
*  What is your reporting shed light on? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=92.86s)]
*  What this basically does is it helps to bolster the credibility in the statements that these [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=97.1s)]
*  two women have made to investigators. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=104.66s)]
*  As you were pointing out, their lawyer has been on television the past few days saying [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=107.74s)]
*  that these two women had testified to the House Ethics Committee about being paid for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=112.58s)]
*  sex with Gaetz. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=119.02s)]
*  What this document shows, and we have an unredacted version of the document, we redacted it to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=121.78s)]
*  make it public so people could see what this actually looks like. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=127.24s)]
*  What the unredacted version of it shows is thousands of dollars going from Gaetz to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=131.98s)]
*  at least these two women, including a third who has told authorities that she was paid [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=140.54s)]
*  for sex. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=146.14s)]
*  What this helps us understand is how much money was going back and forth between Gaetz [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  and these women. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=156.66s)]
*  The lawyer says that the women would usually be paid between $500 to $1,000 or so for one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=158.28s)]
*  of their encounters with Gaetz, which would sometimes include several days together and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=168.48s)]
*  partying that went on during that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=175.0s)]
*  It gives us a larger sense here of how much money was going back and forth. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=179.16s)]
*  ultimately, these two women received a total of $10,000 from Gaetz, one $6,000, another [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=184.04s)]
*  $4,000. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=191.6s)]
*  Putting all these facts aside, what this helps to show is what was going on inside of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=192.76s)]
*  federal investigation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=199.28s)]
*  This shows what federal investigators knew, the ability that they had to see into Gaetz' [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=201.0s)]
*  finances and how they were able to establish that Gaetz was sending money to these women. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=207.56s)]
*  This is important because Gaetz has denied the allegations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=214.52s)]
*  He has said that none of this is true, that he never paid for sex. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=217.72s)]
*  But this document, this Department of Justice document that was used in the investigation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=222.24s)]
*  of Gaetz shows money going from him to the women. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=227.32s)]
*  Yeah, we should say that Mr. Leppert, the name of that lawyer who has two clients, who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  you're reporting indicates are some of the recipients of this money that's being paid [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=236.52s)]
*  by Gaetz and that he says have testified, I think in multiple venues, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=240.76s)]
*  But certainly the Ethics Committee, you know, under oath saying that they were paid for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=249.36s)]
*  sex with Matt Gaetz. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=253.08s)]
*  I believe one of them testified that she saw Matt Gaetz having sex with a minor, 17-year-old [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=254.08s)]
*  at the time, a woman that she's a friend of. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=259.0s)]
*  Again, Gaetz denies all this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=261.6s)]
*  It seems that, you know, what Gaetz's folks and what Trump's folks have been saying is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=264.24s)]
*  like, well, they didn't charge him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  He was, quote, cleared by the DOJ. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=270.52s)]
*  And clearly they're correct that he was not charged for this, whatever the investigation [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  bore out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=278.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=279.08s)]
*  He was not charged. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=280.08s)]
*  Others were. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  The chief accuser of his, a guy named Joel Greenberg, who was a local tax collector in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=283.52s)]
*  pled guilty to this charge and cooperated against Gaetz and talked about how he had [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=290.52s)]
*  seen Gaetz have sex with a 17-year-old girl. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  One of the women of the, you know, who was a client of the lawyer, Mr. Leppard, has told [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=298.56s)]
*  congressional investigators that she saw Mr. Gaetz have sex with a 17-year-old. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=304.68s)]
*  It is true that the department did not charge Gaetz, but what you're seeing, and if you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=310.84s)]
*  think through it, it makes sense, is that if Gaetz's nomination goes forward, he will [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  almost certainly, you'd have to think, be asked at his hearing, at his confirmation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=322.4s)]
*  hearing, whether he had sex with women for money. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=328.56s)]
*  And if, you know, that will put him in a position where he will have to answer the question. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  He could also take the Fifth Amendment if he, if he really thought that he had criminal [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=338.44s)]
*  exposure there and didn't want to answer it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=342.0s)]
*  But whatever he says to that answer will be really interesting, because obviously if he [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=345.48s)]
*  says yes, that means one thing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=349.48s)]
*  If he says no, he's contradicting witnesses and other evidence that backs them up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=351.16s)]
*  And if he takes the Fifth Amendment, you'll have an attorney general, if he's confirmed, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=356.56s)]
*  who took the Fifth Amendment during his confirmation hearing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=360.68s)]
*  Yeah, we should note here the obvious point in all this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=363.68s)]
*  Obviously, having sex with someone underage when you're a man in his 30s is illegal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=367.44s)]
*  Paying for sex is illegal. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=374.24s)]
*  The Department of Justice is the chief law enforcement organ in the country and in the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=376.4s)]
*  federal government, and he would be overseeing enforcement of that, not to mention the enforcement [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=380.6s)]
*  of the prohibition on Schedule I drugs, another part of what the Department of Justice does. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=384.92s)]
*  Michael Schmidt, thank you very much. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVso0FeiEwo&t=391.44s)]
