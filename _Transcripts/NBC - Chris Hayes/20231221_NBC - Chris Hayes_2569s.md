# All In with Chris Hayes - Dec. 21  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=0.0s)]
*  I did everything right and they indicted me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=3.54s)]
*  The paradox of the Trump polling. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=7.0s)]
*  Zero evidence, zero convictions, right? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Why so many voters know the ex-president did something criminal but still plan to vote [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  for him anyway. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=18.64s)]
*  For the most part, even if he was found guilty, I would still vote for him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is here on that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=25.24s)]
*  Then just hours after the Colorado Supreme Court kicked Trump off the ballot, the threats [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=27.24s)]
*  started pouring in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=32.04s)]
*  Ryan Reilly has the latest. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=33.64s)]
*  Plus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  It is language that is meant to divide us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  It is language that I think people have rightly found similar to the language of Hitler. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=39.08s)]
*  The Biden campaign now explicitly calling out what Donald Trump is doing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  I never read Mein Kampf. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=50.2s)]
*  And Rudy Giuliani declares bankruptcy rather than pay out millions in lawsuits. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=53.36s)]
*  Just who he owes money to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=57.76s)]
*  When All In starts right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=59.48s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=66.4s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes in our very polarized country where it's hard to achieve consensus on just [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=67.4s)]
*  about anything. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=71.2s)]
*  A strong majority of Americans believe that Donald Trump is a crook. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=72.2s)]
*  This comes from new polling by the New York Times, which found that 58% of registered [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=76.26s)]
*  the ex president has committed serious federal crimes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=81.64s)]
*  Just a third of voters, 33% said no, he hasn't. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=86.08s)]
*  That's a 25 point gap. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=88.76s)]
*  And again, in our very divided times, that counts as a very strong consensus. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=90.6s)]
*  And to be clear, this was not some abnormally anti Trump survey. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=96.48s)]
*  In the very same poll, 46% of registered voters said they would vote for Donald Trump if the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  election were held today compared to 44% for Joe Biden. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=105.56s)]
*  That is within the margin of error. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=109.56s)]
*  So 11 months out, it appears to be a neck and neck race between the incumbent Democratic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=110.88s)]
*  president and the guy who is facing 91 felony counts across four separate states and federal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=115.2s)]
*  cases. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=121.0s)]
*  This is of course the paradox, the thing that has left so many of us scratching our heads. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=122.3s)]
*  Those two results from the same poll conducted just last week show that there's a group of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=127.4s)]
*  voters who believe Donald Trump committed serious crimes or at least think it's possible [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=130.68s)]
*  and are still planning on voting for him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=135.04s)]
*  Now to be clear, this is just a sliver of the electorate, but it's that sliver that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=137.48s)]
*  will probably be pivotal, the deciding voters next November. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=141.04s)]
*  And it is both bewildering and maddening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=145.84s)]
*  But I think another new poll actually shed some really helpful light on this seeming [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=149.44s)]
*  paradox. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=153.96s)]
*  Now this one comes in the wake of that Colorado Supreme Court decision that Donald Trump is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=155.16s)]
*  disqualified from appearing on the ballot in that state. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=159.32s)]
*  Earlier this week, the court ruled that the ex-president ran afoul of the 14th amendment [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=163.36s)]
*  of the constitution by engaging in the insurrection against the United States, and he is therefore [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=167.68s)]
*  ineligible for office under the explicit text of the 14th amendment section three. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  Now if you've been following the commentary over the past couple days, you would probably [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=178.44000000000003s)]
*  assume that Americans are divided, maybe even mostly against that ruling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=182.08s)]
*  Whatever you think about Donald Trump or his attempted coup, the Colorado decision does [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=187.4s)]
*  effectively take the choice out of the hands of voters. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=191.44s)]
*  It bars him from the ballot. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=193.8s)]
*  And it's not crazy to think that people don't like that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=195.68s)]
*  At least some portion of people resent that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  But of course, it is also a completely unprecedented situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=200.68s)]
*  It is like nothing we have ever experienced, at least since the Civil War and the history [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=204.6s)]
*  of this country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=208.72s)]
*  As it turns out, according to this snap poll conducted by YouGov, 54% of American adults [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=209.72s)]
*  approve of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling to remove Trump from the ballot. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=216.72s)]
*  Again, look at those numbers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=221.72s)]
*  Plus 20. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=223.72s)]
*  54 to 35. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=224.72s)]
*  Once again, that's in this divided country a pretty healthy majority, a nearly 20-point [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=227.2s)]
*  gap, and I've got to say, that result kind of surprised me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=234.2s)]
*  But I think it also says something important about a key failure of our collective political [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=239.16s)]
*  and legal institutions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=244.52s)]
*  Our legal system and our political system together have failed to definitively signal [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=247.12s)]
*  to the American public to tell them that, yes, Donald Trump is a criminal who should [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=252.92s)]
*  not be a legitimate candidate for political office. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=256.84s)]
*  Instead, what Americans have seen is a man flagrantly engaged in a long record of corruption [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=259.88s)]
*  and criminality, never facing any real serious consequences. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=266.0s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump was the first president to be impeached twice, the second time for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=270.96s)]
*  inciting an insurrection. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=275.2s)]
*  And even though that impeachment vote was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in history, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=277.12s)]
*  he still fell short of conviction. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=281.76s)]
*  Nearly three years later, the same guy, the ex-president, has been indicted in four different [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=285.0s)]
*  jurisdictions. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=288.88s)]
*  He faces 91 criminal counts. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=289.88s)]
*  But again, he has not actually been tried or convicted on any of them yet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  He remains free, campaigning across the country as a legitimate candidate for the White House. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=296.08s)]
*  In fact, their front runner for the Republican nomination. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=299.56s)]
*  The Colorado ruling was really the first time that any part of our legal system declared [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=302.88s)]
*  definitively, no, this guy, Donald Trump, because of what he has done, is outside the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=309.12s)]
*  bounds of what is acceptable in American democratic practice. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=315.16s)]
*  The court said he is not eligible to be part of our democratic institutions, that his sin [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=321.36s)]
*  was so grave it places him outside of those democratic institutions, and a majority of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=325.56s)]
*  Americans polled right after the decision agree with him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=330.96s)]
*  It seems to me there is a certain portion of the public that is looking to the institutions [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=335.84s)]
*  of American governance and law for some kind of answer, some kind of definitive judgment, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=340.46s)]
*  that Donald Trump is officially what he appears to be, officially a criminal, that what he [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=347.24s)]
*  has done is so beyond the pale that he cannot hold office again. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=351.76s)]
*  In the absence of those kinds of rulings from anywhere except Colorado, I also think [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=357.2s)]
*  it's easy for people to feel like, well, I guess he's not that bad. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we hear this all the time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=366.64s)]
*  Just listen to these New Hampshire voters at a Trump rally last week. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=369.2s)]
*  He's still president. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=373.4s)]
*  I mean, those, they're just charges right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=374.4s)]
*  There's, it hasn't been found guilty. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=376.88s)]
*  I think he, the reason why all this persecution after Trump is because he's the best candidate [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=378.64s)]
*  and he is the right one to rule the country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=386.16s)]
*  I just feel that it's all a setup. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=389.32s)]
*  I just think that it's anything to bring him down, keep him off the ballot. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=391.44s)]
*  And I'm just, I don't know, I'm not swaying the mega all the way. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=396.16s)]
*  OK, now let's be clear. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=401.72s)]
*  Not all the people can be swayed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=403.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm reasonably certain that a conviction won't change that voter's mind or any of those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=405.44s)]
*  voters. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=410.2s)]
*  They're at a Trump rally. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=411.2s)]
*  But, but, but there are also people who aren't quite sure what to make of it all. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=412.2s)]
*  And taken together, I think what all the recent polling tells us is that if our systems do [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=420.48s)]
*  what they should, if they decisively rule against Trump, that will affect public opinion [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=425.36s)]
*  among that sliver. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=430.92s)]
*  That is one of the reasons it is so vitally important for Donald Trump to be tried with [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  his full constitutional rights before a jury of his peers as soon as possible. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=437.12s)]
*  The public needs that information. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=441.48s)]
*  They need a conclusion from our legal system about who they may be voting for in November. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=443.12s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is former president and director of counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=449.48s)]
*  and the founding director of Harvard University's new 14th Amendment Center for Law and Democracy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=453.64s)]
*  She also informally consulted on the Colorado case, disqualified Donald Trump for the ballot, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=459.6s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=464.0s)]
*  I don't want to make too much, Sherrilyn, of one poll that was a snap poll taken just [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=465.68s)]
*  in reaction. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=469.92s)]
*  But in some ways, I think it's instructive because it's sort of a first thought, best [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=470.92s)]
*  thought kind of thing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=474.24s)]
*  Like, it comes down, what do you think? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=475.24s)]
*  And I'm curious your reaction to that, saying that 54% of voters approve, 33 disapprove, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=477.16s)]
*  of a decision that I think in the mainstream discourse has been far more contentious. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  Sherrilyn Yeah, thanks, Chris. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=487.64s)]
*  You know, of course, I'm heartened that a majority of those polled said that they approved [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=490.44s)]
*  of the decision. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=494.84s)]
*  The folks that you interviewed, that your team interviewed, who said, you know, it won't [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=497.6s)]
*  change my mind. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=501.0s)]
*  It's just a setup. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=502.0s)]
*  There's still just charges and all the things they've said about the other cases involving [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=503.76s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=508.52s)]
*  You know, it's very much like what people would say maybe in, you know, the neighborhood [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=509.52s)]
*  next over from me about someone who was arrested and accused of being a drug kingpin. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=514.64s)]
*  People who've seen that person in the neighborhood, who liked that person who handed out turkeys [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=521.76s)]
*  on Thanksgiving, who was a funny person and engaged with people, would say all of those [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=525.96s)]
*  things. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=532.08s)]
*  So that doesn't trouble me that there are people who are saying, I'm still with him. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=533.08s)]
*  I think it's good that a majority of people are hearing this and feeling like there is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=536.76s)]
*  something there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=542.36s)]
*  The good news about Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is that it's easy to read. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=543.6s)]
*  There's really nothing confusing about the language. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=549.12s)]
*  That's my first reaction. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=553.0s)]
*  The second reaction, Chris, is I don't care. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=554.12s)]
*  We don't put questions of legality or eligibility for the ballot to polls. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=556.9s)]
*  These are the words of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=564.6s)]
*  We don't run a poll on whether if Donald Trump said he was 34 years old or if he didn't [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=568.84s)]
*  continuously live in the United States for 14 years, which is another requirement, we [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=576.96s)]
*  don't put that to a plebiscite. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=581.6s)]
*  Those are the qualifications for those seeking this office. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  And the reason it's so important, Section 3, which comes to us after the Civil War, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  is that those framers, Chris, had looked insurrectionist in the eye. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=593.72s)]
*  They had faced a divided and broken country. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  They had seen the ultimate in white supremacist ideology. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=601.64s)]
*  And Section 3 was included precisely because they understood the danger of these two strains [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=605.92s)]
*  in American life to undo the possibility of the new democracy that was being created after [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=612.16s)]
*  the Civil War. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=618.28s)]
*  And I think for the last five years, so many people have been throwing up their hands saying, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=619.74s)]
*  we've never seen anything like this. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=623.68s)]
*  What can we do to stop someone like Donald Trump? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=625.56s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=628.16s)]
*  We haven't had to deal with this since the Civil War. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=629.04s)]
*  Thank goodness, because most of our presidents, all of our presidents, save one, have not [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=631.44s)]
*  tried to overthrow the legitimate election of their successor. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=636.88s)]
*  But the framers of the 14th Amendment created tools for us to be able to deal with the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=641.16s)]
*  possibility that there would be those who would be in this position. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=647.24s)]
*  And the simple phrase tells us that what they're saying is that if you are disloyal to the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=651.28s)]
*  Constitution of the United States, having once taken office and taking an oath of office [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=657.44s)]
*  in the past and then engaged in insurrectional rebellion or having provided aid and comfort [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  to those who did engage in insurrectional rebellion against the Constitution, you are [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=668.84s)]
*  ineligible for public office at either the state or the federal level. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=673.8800000000001s)]
*  It's perfectly logical. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=678.08s)]
*  It's there. It was created by these framers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think it's very easy for people to understand. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, one of the one of the things that has been a recurring theme of this era, right, is [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=686.4s)]
*  pushing is that Trump pushes against every boundary around him and sees how far he can go. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. And one of the things I thought about actually in the wake of this, and this has been [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=698.76s)]
*  occasioned by a few people making this point, it is interesting, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  We talk about the 34 year old or someone who is not a U.S. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=705.88s)]
*  citizen or not a natural born citizen. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=710.0s)]
*  Right. Like, clearly, like you can't you couldn't put a 20 year old on the ballot for [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=711.4s)]
*  president. Right. We all understand that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=714.84s)]
*  And the thought I had was as you watch this sort of interesting, granular question of like, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=716.4s)]
*  oh, well, how does this actually work? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=720.96s)]
*  Right. State by state and in Maine, the secretary of state is going to decide and in Colorado, the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=722.44s)]
*  voters can sue. And I had the thought of, well, what if someone, Donald Trump, for instance, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=726.32s)]
*  wanted to seek a third term? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  Clearly, the Constitution says he can't. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=733.48s)]
*  And clearly you could say, well, it would be anti-democratic to not have him on the ballot. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the people should decide. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=741.72s)]
*  But no, actually, in the Constitution, right in the Constitution, we're just sorry, we're just [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=742.8s)]
*  clear about that. But then the question becomes like, right, when the rubber hits the road, if a [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=748.3599999999999s)]
*  certain person says I'm running for a third term, it turns out it's just going to be a test of the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=752.4s)]
*  same sets of institutions and laws. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. Whether they can say no, you can't. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=758.1199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. And this decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is incredibly thorough, goes through all [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  the evidence. This is this is a court that understands what the stakes are. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=766.68s)]
*  It will head to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=770.3599999999999s)]
*  And as I've said in the past, this is really going to be a test for the Supreme Court because the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=772.24s)]
*  plain text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is very clear. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=777.88s)]
*  The findings of the trial court and the affirmation by the Colorado Supreme Court are very [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  clear and well-founded. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  The dissenters in the Colorado Supreme Court case dissent on grounds that have to do with [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=789.24s)]
*  Colorado state law. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  And for your viewers who don't know, a state's highest court is the last word on the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=795.8s)]
*  interpretation of that state's local laws, that state's laws. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=801.3599999999999s)]
*  So the Supreme Court is not really in a position to overturn on the grounds that the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  dissenters in the case dissented. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  So this is going to be a real test for them. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=814.4s)]
*  There are people who suggested that we're naive to think that they will do the right thing and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=817.16s)]
*  uphold this. That's not really why we file cases. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=821.64s)]
*  I'm a civil rights lawyer. I don't file a case thinking the Supreme Court is definitely going to rule my [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=824.72s)]
*  way. You file a case because you have a legal claim that must be vindicated. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=828.0s)]
*  And this is critically important. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=834.44s)]
*  We so often ignore the 14th Amendment when it is central to our ability to create a healthy [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  democracy. And at our peril, we have ignored sections of it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=844.16s)]
*  We have distorted it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=847.84s)]
*  We have upended it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=849.0s)]
*  We have used it for ends that it was not meant for. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=850.12s)]
*  But this section of the 14th Amendment was meant precisely for the occasion in which we would find [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=853.64s)]
*  ourselves now. And by the way, it doesn't just apply to Donald Trump. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=859.28s)]
*  So I hope that all those other insurrectionists who are holding office or planning to run for [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=862.92s)]
*  reelection, I hope they're sleeping a little more fitfully after this Colorado Supreme Court [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=869.0s)]
*  ruling because it's not over. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=874.52s)]
*  Yeah, and I should note here Judge Michael Ludwig, who has become a very vocal Trump critic and was [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=876.76s)]
*  a sort of legendary conservative, real conservative jurist. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=882.24s)]
*  He was set on the Federal Appeals Court before he left. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=886.6s)]
*  He was in the shortlist to be a Supreme Court justice. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, he says that he said it's the opposite of politics, this ruling, that the Constitution [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=893.2s)]
*  itself tells us that disqualification of the former president is not anti-democratic. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=898.0s)]
*  Rather, it tells us is the conduct that gave rise to disqualification under the 14th that is [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=902.08s)]
*  anti-democratic. Final question for you is on the second point here about the sort of necessity of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=907.08s)]
*  there's the 14th Amendment, Section 3, and then there's also will the legal system be allowed to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=913.76s)]
*  run its course and have a full trial before a jury with full constitutional rights in due process of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  this man in times that people can judge who they are voting for? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=925.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to separate this out because there are so many cases. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=932.08s)]
*  You know, you're right. There is the criminal case. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=935.6s)]
*  We have Jack Smith's case. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=939.12s)]
*  We also have, you know, the LDF KKK case that got a huge boost today with the finding of telephone [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  phone calls with Trump and Wayne County canvassers in 2020. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=949.44s)]
*  And so we've got a lot of different things going on that need to move through the system. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=954.6800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, this is still a test for the Supreme Court because they're going to have to make a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=958.32s)]
*  decision about the very question that you're asking me. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=962.12s)]
*  They have to ask themselves in a democratic system, don't the voters have the right to know [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=964.92s)]
*  whether this person is, in fact, guilty of the crimes of which he's accused or not before they vote [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=969.6s)]
*  in that election? Now, the Supreme Court can engage in sleight of hand. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=975.16s)]
*  I mean, I could imagine them trying to resuscitate that Purcell doctrine that says we don't change [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=978.68s)]
*  things about an election too close to an election. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=983.96s)]
*  I mean, it would be outrageous to take a shadow docket decision and use it in this way, but it would [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=986.1999999999999s)]
*  not. I would not put it past them. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  They may say on the Section 3 case that there needs to be enabling legislation by Congress to remove [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=993.04s)]
*  someone from the ballot. I mean, there are a million ways I think they will try to avoid this, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=999.04s)]
*  because, Chris, there is no way looking at the text, at the history, at the intention of the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1003.16s)]
*  provision, at the trial court record, at the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, that just on [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1008.7199999999999s)]
*  the legality, not on the politics, just on the legality, you could strike down that decision. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1014.48s)]
*  So that's the Colorado Supreme Court decision. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  The other cases are those criminal cases that need to move. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1022.96s)]
*  Jack Smith is trying to move to directly to the Supreme Court. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1026.76s)]
*  I can't think of a rational or even legal reason why they would not accept that expeditious [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1030.88s)]
*  hearing and turn it back to the Court of Appeals. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1036.92s)]
*  And so I think the Supreme Court is in a tough spot. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1040.4s)]
*  Of course, they're the 800 pound gorilla. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1043.04s)]
*  They get to do whatever they want. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1044.68s)]
*  But every time they depart from what is plainly the correct legal course by the rules that they [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1046.36s)]
*  have created and upheld, every time they depart from that, they further undercut their [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  legitimacy and they lay the groundwork for the changes that will happen to the structure of the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1057.12s)]
*  Supreme Court in the coming years. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1064.32s)]
*  I'm sure those changes will happen, but they will happen more readily and with more public support, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1065.68s)]
*  the more the court is perceived as departing from its own standards and from standards of [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1070.6000000000001s)]
*  legitimacy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1076.56s)]
*  Sherrilyn, I feel always a great, great pleasure to have you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1078.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1082.2s)]
*  It happened after the George and Diamond, happened after the search of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1084.52s)]
*  It happened to the judge in the January 6 case. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1088.16s)]
*  Now it's happening to the Colorado Supreme Court justices. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1090.32s)]
*  The deluge of threats against the justices after their ruling on Donald Trump. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1093.32s)]
*  That's next. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1096.92s)]
*  When the Colorado Supreme Court majority released its decision earlier this week, barring [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1100.76s)]
*  Donald Trump from the state's primary ballot under the 14th Amendment, some people notice a [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1104.76s)]
*  pretty small but a very telling detail. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1108.8400000000001s)]
*  The justices didn't sign their names to it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  It was signed as per curiam. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  That's from the court. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1115.48s)]
*  And many people guess that this was related to their personal safety. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  By not putting their names on the decision, the justices might be able to reduce the amount of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  harassment, outright threats of violence that they would receive. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1125.52s)]
*  After all, the state Supreme Court justices of Colorado are basically just normal people. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1128.68s)]
*  I mean, they're not really public figures. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1132.8400000000001s)]
*  And they had to know that they would suddenly be nationwide targets of the invective, first of [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1135.76s)]
*  all, but more worryingly of the possible threats of violence from Naga Diehards. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1140.88s)]
*  Sadly, it appears that is already the case. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1146.0s)]
*  As Ryan Reilly reports for NBC News, quote, social media outlets have been flooded with [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1148.16s)]
*  threats against the justices who ruled in the case. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1152.2s)]
*  NBC News justice reporter Ryan Reilly joins me now. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1155.28s)]
*  Ryan, Ryan, tell me about what you found in your reporting about that deluge of invective and even threats. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1158.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, sadly, it's sort of predictable, right? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1164.8s)]
*  I was even talking to my wife tonight. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1167.0s)]
*  This this came out and she was like, well, they're going to get a lot of threats. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1171.72s)]
*  And that's what this report really lays out. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1173.0s)]
*  And, you know, advanced democracy has done a great job of sort of chronicling a lot of the outlets, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1175.52s)]
*  especially that were the subject of a lot of these threats. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1179.72s)]
*  The subject of a lot of these threats in the lead up to January six, for example, and it's happened time and time again. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1183.52s)]
*  You know, you see it on Trump's true social platform. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1189.04s)]
*  You see it on some of these other extremist sites where there's just a lot of garbage, a lot of really violent rhetoric that gets thrown out towards these politicians and a lot of anger. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1191.72s)]
*  After the Mar-a-Lago raid, you know, we can go to a million examples. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1202.48s)]
*  But after the Mar-a-Lago raid, there was a lot of these threats. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1206.4s)]
*  And we saw an FBI field office get attacked by someone who was at the Capitol on January six. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1208.68s)]
*  So there is just a lot of this. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1213.8s)]
*  And it's a lot for, I think, federal law enforcement officers and law enforcement officers across the country to deal with, because it's it's really tough to sort out the wheat from the chaff here and what rises to the level of a threat. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  But just the sort of the volume of these threats is just sort of incredible. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  And then it's like, which person is going to be the person who's actually going to act on that? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1230.44s)]
*  So it's a really huge challenge for law enforcement. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  That's that's a great point. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1236.8s)]
*  We should also know, I mean, there's a million examples, but the one that I've been thinking about is some of the litigation has revealed that the clerk for the judge in the New York civil fraud case, having her personal phone number put on the Internet and receiving like [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1237.76s)]
*  50 harassing or threatening messages a day, some of them anti-Semitic. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1250.2s)]
*  And one of the things I think it's probably worth just taking a second here on, because I think people sometimes have a conception that these folks like the Colorado Supreme Court justice is kind of more fortified. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1255.44s)]
*  Than they are. I mean, these are people I imagine that don't even have probably 24 hour security normally who just go to the grocery store and drive around, take their kids to Little League games and and don't have some some huge amount of security that now I would imagine there's there's probably 24 hour conversations happening that are unprecedented for those justices and for the court of what they're going to do about the security of these individuals. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1267.64s)]
*  That's going to be tangibly life changing for them and how they live their minute to minute day to day lives. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I think I mean, this is something I especially figures in the media, for example, have to deal with as well all the time. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1297.08s)]
*  Right. So like you'd imagine they're using some of these services now that might take their addresses offline. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1302.32s)]
*  But for for regular judges, that might not have been such this pressing issue for them. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. That wasn't something they're used to, because on their average day when they're returning various cases, they're not necessarily getting these direct threats. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1311.8s)]
*  There's not all this public outcry. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1320.04s)]
*  And when there is threats, it's usually maybe involving a direct case, someone who is threatening them is actually directly involved in the case. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1321.6s)]
*  And here it's just really the volume. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1327.72s)]
*  It's like impossible for them to keep up on and keep in keeping like what coming is coming in their email as well as what is just publicly available on some of these social media websites. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1329.6s)]
*  It really is just sort of the security nightmare and sorting through which ones are the most serious and who you actually have to pay attention to is a major challenge. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1338.6s)]
*  Right. It's the same challenge that we had before January 6 itself, where you had the situation where the FBI ended up treating this as a problem of individual access and focusing on the really people who are really extreme. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1346.12s)]
*  And that's just not how you know. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1357.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And if you end up focusing on a date and time is really the really scary part. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  If there's you know, if Donald Trump could at the you know, with his thumbs, right, tweet out something or send something that could direct people in a certain way. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1363.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's a great point. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1372.84s)]
*  And just to give people a little bit of the color of this, this is from your article that, you know, posts whose images and links were included in this report from from Advanced Democracy noted a variety of methods that could be used to kill those perceived as Trump's enemies. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1375.9599999999998s)]
*  Hollow point bullets, rifles, rope bombs, kill judges, head judges, roundhouse kick a judge into the concrete, read a post on a fringe website, slam dunk a judge's baby into the trash can. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1388.04s)]
*  And to be clear here, like to your point about the FBI and also lead up to January 6, like people say all sorts of horrible things on the Internet every second of every day about all sorts of people. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1397.84s)]
*  And it's very hard to know what what's real and what's not. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1408.6s)]
*  But we also know in the case of you know, you cited the FBI, I just cited and Gorn, but also people like Alvin Bragg and others getting specific and credible threats like, you know, Alvin Bragg, you know, I am going to come and kill you, a man who is arrested for essentially threatening that. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  So this there's a whole sort of kind of funnel here from the most like awful things on websites to very specific threats. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1427.12s)]
*  And now these justices have to deal with with all that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1434.9199999999998s)]
*  Ryan Riley, as always, great to have you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1437.48s)]
*  Thanks for your time. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1439.36s)]
*  Ryan's new book, Sedition Hunters, how January 6 broke the justice system is available now. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1442.4399999999998s)]
*  Coming up, what Rudy Giuliani declares bankruptcy to try to wriggle out of his defamation payment. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1449.24s)]
*  But oh, the information revealed in the paperwork will be taking a look at that right after this break. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1454.68s)]
*  The epic dissent of Rudy Giuliani hit a new level today as he declared bankruptcy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  Giuliani officially filed for Chapter 11 protection, telling the Southern District of New York he's received credit counsel and he has no student. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1471.64s)]
*  No consumer debts, no business debts. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1478.48s)]
*  But, well, he does owe his other creditors one hundred and fifty one million seven hundred and eighty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty nine dollars and ninety eight cents. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1480.48s)]
*  That's a nine figure sum that he says he cannot repay. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, most of that came from last week's judgment against him for defaming Georgia election workers, Seamus and Ruby Freeman after the 2020 election. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  He now owes them one hundred and forty six million dollars, according to the judge in that case. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1501.92s)]
*  In fact, the bankruptcy filing came the day after that same judge in the in the in the defamation case ordered immediate collection, the judgment saying a delay might give Giuliani time to conceal his assets. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1507.04s)]
*  This bankruptcy now puts all payouts and litigation on hold. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1520.24s)]
*  That's the point of it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1523.16s)]
*  By the way, Moss and Freeman sued Giuliani again on Monday for repeating his defamation of them again outside the courthouse right after being ordered to pay millions of dollars for defaming them. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1524.48s)]
*  Giuliani's bankruptcy filing says he owes about a million dollars in tax debts to the IRS in New York state, which strikes me as a lot. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1537.4s)]
*  And also, like, I guess that's just chilling out there and you can just do that under Biden be interested in that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1544.16s)]
*  The rest is for legal fees and claims against him, most of which most of which he's still fighting in court. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1549.32s)]
*  His bankruptcy filing is basically a kind of like compendium of outstanding lawsuits. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1553.96s)]
*  You've got your smartmatic and dominion, the voting machine companies who both say he defamed them. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1559.2s)]
*  Then there's the former employee suing him for sexual assault and harassment. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1564.16s)]
*  Remember that case? Really, really ugly allegations in that lawsuit. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  There's a Staten Island shop, right? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1572.0s)]
*  Employee who's suing Giuliani for falsely alleging assault after the man tapped Giuliani's back in the supermarket. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  That was the that was the assault assault you just saw right there. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  There's even Hunter Biden, who I had forgotten, is suing Giuliani for accessing his personal laptop data. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1586.48s)]
*  It's a good reminder that Giuliani still has a lot of legal fees and troubles to come. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1592.76s)]
*  And remember, he is also a current criminal defendant in the Georgia election Rico case. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1596.36s)]
*  Interestingly, the story from Rudy Giuliani and people around him is that he's basically dead broke. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1602.84s)]
*  The only thing he has left is his apartment. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1607.68s)]
*  Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that the FBI spent three years looking into Giuliani's failing finances as part of their Ukraine probe. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1610.08s)]
*  Investigators didn't charge him, but they did learn he had dwindling cash reserves and growing credit card debts. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1616.92s)]
*  Remember, the judge overseeing that big defamation award just said in her Tuesday ruling that Giuliani is so untrustworthy he might hide whatever assets he has. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1622.56s)]
*  A reporter who's been doggedly unearthing the truth about Rudy Giuliani's finances and just who he owes money to joins me next. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1631.8s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy filing includes lists of creditors. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1644.1599999999999s)]
*  He owes over one hundred and fifty million dollars. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  And as Daily Beast reporter Roger Sollenberger points out, these lists are like a road map to the downfall of the man once known as America's mayor. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1649.24s)]
*  One of the people on the list, for instance, is attorney Robert Costello's firm. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1657.08s)]
*  Now, Costello represented Giuliani in a whole bunch of things, from the federal investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine, to the FBI raid on his home and office, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1660.28s)]
*  to the January 6th committee's investigation into the insurrection, to disciplinary proceedings that could lead to his disbarment for helping Trump try to steal the election. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1668.56s)]
*  The criminal case against Giuliani in Georgia, where he is now indicted on 13 felony charges. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1677.8s)]
*  Now, according to the filing, Costello's firm, Davidoff, Hutcher and Citron, is claiming they are owed over one point three million dollars, an amount that Giuliani disputes. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1682.16s)]
*  But that amount pales in comparison to the one hundred and forty six million dollars a judge ordered Giuliani to pay former Georgia election workers Rumi Freeman and Shea Moss for defamation. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1692.84s)]
*  Roger Sollenberger is a senior political reporter for Daily Beast. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1703.76s)]
*  He's been reporting on Giuliani for years and he's been poring through this filing all day. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1706.48s)]
*  Roger, I've been following your reporting. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1710.72s)]
*  So just first sort of take a throw through what you gleaned from this bankruptcy filing the federal court today. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1712.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the most fascinating thing to me, like you're saying, is this roadmap. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1718.64s)]
*  Like, very rarely do you get to see a look at someone's personal downfall laid out so neatly before you. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1724.32s)]
*  Right. The list of creditors is really the like the roadmap or just the story, a path through the last four years or so of Rudy Giuliani's precipitous public decline, which we have seen. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1732.52s)]
*  And because he's been such a character and has been through so many events in that time, you tend to forget just how many things have happened. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1744.2s)]
*  And yeah, this this probably really takes you through that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1755.76s)]
*  There's an accounting firm from his 2019 divorce proceedings that is suing him, just sued him in November, I think, for ten thousand dollars. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1759.64s)]
*  They just seen the writing on the wall. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1770.1200000000001s)]
*  There's a lawsuit from a former assistant that is suing him for like pretty revolting claims of sexual harassment. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1772.52s)]
*  I don't know if we remember those. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1780.88s)]
*  There are two law firms that are suing him for fees that wrote him. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1783.44s)]
*  One of them is or at least was representing him in Georgia for free, but they are also claiming back fees. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1786.68s)]
*  There's Costello's firm claim back fees. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1793.44s)]
*  There's the IRS. There's the New York State Department of Taxation that is claiming from him. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  It's really a looking at as a portrait of a man. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1800.44s)]
*  It's not not so flattering. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1804.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that the Times noted, of course, too, are just in terms of this, like, you know, the sort of epic downfall, just as almost Greek mythic sort of trajectory of the. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1807.0800000000002s)]
*  This individual who to my mind has for much of his career displayed precisely the same attributes consistently. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1816.44s)]
*  But I should note that he really lived a lavish life that he made millions of dollars a year in his private law practice after he left public office. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1823.44s)]
*  He had this consulting firm that was enormously lucrative after 9 11. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1831.92s)]
*  His divorce from his third wife exposed the couple's once lavish lifestyle. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1836.72s)]
*  A two hundred and thirty thousand dollar a month spending habit. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1839.88s)]
*  Six houses, 11 country club memberships. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1843.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, he says he's broke. He's filed for bankruptcy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1845.64s)]
*  He owes all these people money. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1848.72s)]
*  I guess the question is, given the judge saying she doesn't trust he's not hiding assets, like what do we know about how much this is an actual full display of his actual finances if there's some secret money squirreled away somewhere or there isn't? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1851.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, we don't really quite know. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1865.88s)]
*  We can take him at his word. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  I some assets that I don't think have been listed are four World Series rings that he got when he was mayor that are diamond encrusted and valued. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1871.3600000000001s)]
*  Think about two hundred thousand dollars back in 2007. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1881.16s)]
*  They've got his name on them. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1883.96s)]
*  I don't know if those lawyers are aware that they've existed or if those things might be in hawk somewhere. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  But, you know, those are assets. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1890.48s)]
*  So, you know, he does have money and his wife, his ex-wife, when she was suing him for this divorce proceeding, was alleging that he was concealing his money and that he was doing so, by the way, through his relationship with Trump. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1892.48s)]
*  And it was through that 2018, 2019 mess in Ukraine where Rudy really needed money. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1908.0400000000002s)]
*  He was spending a lot of it allegedly to keep it from his wife. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1915.76s)]
*  You know, the filing also tells this story of spite of him, right? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1920.24s)]
*  It reveals sort of his his character in that way, too. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1924.0s)]
*  But again, working for Trump for free, by the way, to get him impeached the first time, working for him again, 2020, and then trying to charge him not getting paid, getting impeached a second time, going hat in hand to Donald Trump this past year. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1926.68s)]
*  I'm not really sure if he has squirreled away money somewhere. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1944.96s)]
*  Yeah, very to make that speculation. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1950.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. But, you know, I think one tell is that, you know, he has not been paying his bills. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1953.44s)]
*  You know, I don't think that somebody would, you know, and his lawyer, like you were pointing out Robert Costello, a longtime friend of Rudy Giuliani. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1959.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. And that law firm is is suing him for one point four million dollars. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1967.16s)]
*  So is he actually really stiffing his friend on this money to keep something somewhere away from other creditors that he really hates and really doesn't want to have his money? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1971.64s)]
*  You know, who's to say? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1982.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think the Occam's razor here is he's he's broke. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1986.0800000000002s)]
*  We should just note, and you note this in the piece that, you know, the actual damage he did to Ruby Freeman and Seamus's lives is is is remarkable and acute and lasting. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=1989.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's why the jury found found in their favor and one hopes that they do see some actual restitution, whatever whatever comes out of this process. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2001.96s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether that will happen. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2013.0s)]
*  But that remains my hope. Roger Sollenberger, who's done great reporting on this throughout. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2015.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2019.16s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2021.16s)]
*  Still ahead, Trump's plans to escalate his hateful rhetoric in the Biden's campaign. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2023.24s)]
*  Biden campaign's plan to fight back next. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2027.24s)]
*  It is language that is meant to divide us. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2031.4s)]
*  It is language that I think people have rightly found similar to the language of Hitler. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2039.92s)]
*  As Vice President Kamala Harris noted to Lawrence O'Donnell this week, Donald Trump has been mirroring Nazi rhetoric in his speeches, all of its frankly becoming too much to shrug off or ignore. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  And the Biden-Harris reelection campaign has been increasingly explicit about calling attention to Trump's dangerous rhetoric. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2055.88s)]
*  A new image promoted by the campaign features a number of recent statements by Trump, including his comparison of his political opponents to, quote, vermin, his insistence that immigrants are, quote, poisoning the blood of our country, contrasted with similar remarks made by Adolf Hitler. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2062.28s)]
*  Now, there are obviously profound, legitimate sensitivities about comparisons to Hitler and to the Holocaust because of their singularly evil nature in world history. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2077.4s)]
*  In fact, back in the 1990s, attorney Michael Godwin coined what is called Godwin's Law. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2086.84s)]
*  It's an intermittent meme that effectively says the longer an online debate goes on, the longer, likelier it is someone will eventually bring up Hitler or the Nazis. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2090.96s)]
*  Essentially a way to caution against evoking the horrors of the Third Reich too casually. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  But in a new op-ed for The Washington Post, even the Godwin's Law guy says, yeah, the Trump-Hitler comparisons are appropriate here. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2103.24s)]
*  For his part, Trump has responded to all this by promising to do it more. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2110.16s)]
*  Although this week he did publicly deny he's ever read Hitler's memoir Mein Kampf, although there's reporting that he read his speeches. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2114.2s)]
*  There's a new one in presidential campaigns. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2121.3599999999997s)]
*  And on that point, I have to say I tend to believe him only because I'm pretty sure Trump's not big on book reading anyway. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2123.4399999999996s)]
*  But it's worth pointing out again that Trump knows what he is doing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2129.92s)]
*  He and everyone around him understands what they're doing, what this rhetoric is echoing. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2132.8s)]
*  After a decade with this guy, I think it's fairly clear he's saying this stuff because he believes this stuff. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2137.56s)]
*  Asman Soosang is the senior political reporter who helped break the story of Rolling Stone. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2143.6800000000003s)]
*  Adam Serwer is a staff writer at The Atlantic, author of The Cruelty is the Point. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2147.6800000000003s)]
*  They joined me now. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2150.8s)]
*  Swaran, tell us what your sort of reporting says about them essentially kind of doubling down, leading in, continuing to escalate this precise kind of rhetoric. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2152.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, a normal brain person, if they were saying something they truly believed, but were shown an image being like, yo, this sounds a lot like Adolf Hitler, a normal brain person might back off a little bit. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2162.24s)]
*  Donald J. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2176.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump, obviously, even for a politician, is not a normal brain human being. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2177.1600000000003s)]
*  So his instinct, having been presented with that, has been very much to go in the opposite direction. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2181.7200000000003s)]
*  In the days since that New Hampshire rally speech where he reiterated this was not the first time he used the poison, the blood line in public, he spent time telling an array of policy advisors and confidants, according to our reporting at Rolling Stone, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2187.88s)]
*  that if anything, he was being too nice about the quote unquote animals who were crossing the southern border, who were bringing drugs, crime and disease. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2203.32s)]
*  He was saying that he thinks it's a quote unquote great line and he's going to do it more and he wants to keep shoving in the face of the Democrats and media and other people who are telling him to stop. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2213.56s)]
*  So for any of your viewers who have followed Trump since 2015, that in itself might not seem all that shocking. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2224.04s)]
*  But for Republicans who are trying to defend him right now, including but not limited to Senator Lindsey Graham saying that, oh, these are just words and liberals are being too sensitive about it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2231.84s)]
*  I think it's very important to point out that Trump's rhetoric is underverted by a very clear set of 2024 policy proposals that he and his team are loudly, vociferously and proudly promoting that they would want to consummate if brought into a term two of Donald Trump. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2241.88s)]
*  This includes heavily, heavily, heavily militarizing the border. He's talked in private about sending possibly hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2259.36s)]
*  of US troops, including pulling them from places like Germany overseas to stand at the border and help seal it and help build large scale detention camps, a new network of them. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2267.4s)]
*  To house undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation. That is just the tip of the iceberg. I could go on and on about it, but we don't have time right now. So it's not just words. It's about policies and the words and the rhetoric only accurately reflect what he has plans if he gets reelected. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2278.24s)]
*  Yeah, Swin's point, Adam here is well taken that it's both fascist rhetoric and a vision of a fascist governing agenda together sort of unapologetically. What do you think the effect is? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2297.3599999999997s)]
*  To have these phrases repeated by someone like Trump and clearly gobbled up by a certain part of the base, but also just sort of be part of a form of rhetoric we're in the midst of essentially being acclimated to. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2308.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, the reason why this kind of rhetoric is dangerous is because it's dehumanizing when you're talking about people as poison in the blood or as vermin, this kind of thing, which you're sort of setting a pretext for justifiable use of violence against what is a very vulnerable population. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2324.0s)]
*  And I think Swin made what was the important point was that this is not just rhetoric. It undergirds a policy agenda to shift American immigration policy substantially to the right and with substantially greater uses of force than we've seen before. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2346.0s)]
*  And I think the issue here is that what Trump likes to do is he likes to go right up to the line. So he's not talking about race purity yet. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2370.0s)]
*  You know, and I'm not sure if he ever will. He likes to go right up to the line of deniability so that he can accuse people of overreacting when he uses this rhetoric. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2380.76s)]
*  And what that rhetorical strategy does is it makes people numb to it. It makes people get used to it. So they sort of accept it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2390.16s)]
*  You know, they say it's not serious. But what really happens is the brain becomes habituated to it. You become used to it. You dismiss the intentions behind it, no matter how violent they actually are. You become more used to it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2399.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And this point about, I mean, the reason vermin, you know, if anyone has ever read, you know, history of the Rwanda genocide, right, the cockroaches is what the term used by the sort of genocidal and fascist radio station. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2412.24s)]
*  You know, vermin has a very long history in fascism and in this kind of thing. And the reason is that people call extinguishers and people call exterminators for vermin. They kill vermin. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2429.7200000000003s)]
*  That's how you deal with vermin, if you have a vermin infestation. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2445.0s)]
*  And so, Swin, that, I mean, that to me is part of what's terrifying here and chilling beyond the sort of weird sort of narcissistic performatives here and the trolling and ha-ha and kind of like Hitler, aren't I, is that there's a bunch of people hearing this message out there that are being told that either they're political enemies or the sort of desperate folks showing up at the border are not actual human beings and are deserving of being killed. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2448.0s)]
*  Right. And look, Trump draws a lot more rhetorical inspiration from his time of binging and participating in WWE skits than he does from actual intellectual fascist literature and history. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2474.72s)]
*  I mean, I think I don't think that's going to surprise anybody to hear that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2490.2799999999997s)]
*  Having said that, we all we have to do is look at all the things that he knows he can get away with that other politicians on the left and the right wouldn't for a second. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2493.8s)]
*  For instance, especially during his time in office, enemy of the people was his term that he loved to use to bash people in the media and news outlets that he despised, whose coverage he did not like. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2504.2000000000003s)]
*  That is a term that was preferred by death spots like the Khmer Rouge. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2517.92s)]
*  But so if Obama had ever used that to describe Fox News, I don't think we need to pause to think about what the reaction would be on the right to anyone else had done. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2522.8s)]
*  Aswin Soob Singh and Adam Serwer, thank you both. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdm8j2N9SU&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
