Video Description: “You would think Pennsylvania Republicans would have learned their lesson. But apparently not! Right now, another Republican millionaire, Dave McCormick, has announced he’s challenging incumbent Pennsylvania Democrat, Senator Bob Casey. The thing about Dave McCormick is that he lives in Connecticut,” says Chris Hayes. “It is genuinely downright bizarre that in a state with millions of people and lots of Republicans, they really cannot find a single Republican who actually lives in Pennsylvania to run for Senate?”

# Why can't Pennsylvania Republicans find someone to run for Senate?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s)
*  There are about 13 million people living in the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=0.0s)]
*  So why can't Republicans find one of them to run for Senate? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=4.0s)]
*  Regular viewers of this program will no doubt remember last year's Pennsylvania Senate election between the state's then-Lieutenant Governor John Federman and TV doctor Mehmet Oz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=8.0s)]
*  From the very beginning, there was a pretty big problem with Oz's campaign. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=17.0s)]
*  He has lived in New Jersey for years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=21.0s)]
*  That video you're watching on your screen right now, that is a campaign ad for a Pennsylvania Senate seat that Oz recorded from his mansion in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=23.0s)]
*  Now, at this time, then-candidate Federman was still recovering from a stroke. Remember that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=33.0s)]
*  So much of his campaigning was relegated to online spaces where his campaign absolutely bludgeoned Oz with jokes and memes about his carpet-bagging, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=38.0s)]
*  including this video that his campaign commissioned from Snooki, star of Jersey Shore. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=46.0s)]
*  I've heard that you moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania to look for a new job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=53.0s)]
*  I know you're away from home and you're in a new place, but Jersey will not forget you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=58.0s)]
*  I just want to let you know, I will not forget you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=62.0s)]
*  And don't worry, because you'll be back home in Jersey soon. This is only temporary. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=66.0s)]
*  That proved prophetic. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=71.0s)]
*  In a desperate scramble to seem relatable, Oz released this disastrous video trying to attack Democrats over inflation because fancy crudite platters were getting too expensive. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=73.0s)]
*  I thought I'd do some grocery shopping. I'm at Wagner's. My wife wants some vegetables for crudite. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=83.0s)]
*  So here's a broccoli. That's two bucks. A ton of broccoli there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=89.0s)]
*  There's some asparagus. That's four dollars. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=94.0s)]
*  Carrots. That's four more dollars. That's ten dollars of vegetables there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=97.0s)]
*  And then we need some guacamole. That's four dollars more. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=102.0s)]
*  And she loves salsa. Yeah, salsa there. Six dollars. Must be as short as her salsa. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=107.0s)]
*  Guys, that's twenty dollars for crudite. This doesn't include the tequila. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=113.0s)]
*  The Federman campaign was quick to note that right off the top, Oz bungled the name of the Pennsylvania-based grocery store Redners. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=118.0s)]
*  In PA, we call this a veggie tray. And if this looks anything other than a veggie tray to you, then I am not your candidate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=128.0s)]
*  And I'm serious. Dr. Oz doesn't even know the name of the grocery store that he's in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=137.0s)]
*  Now, Federman ended up winning that race by about five points despite suffering the stroke that knocked him off the campaign trail. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=142.0s)]
*  And you would think Pennsylvania Republicans would have learned their lesson. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=147.0s)]
*  But apparently not. Right now, another Republican millionaire, Dave McCormick, has announced he's challenging incumbent Pennsylvania Democrats Senator Bob Casey. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=152.0s)]
*  And the thing about Dave McCormick is that he lives in Connecticut. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=162.0s)]
*  In fact, this is so perfect. According to reporting plus flight logs, it sure looks like McCormick announced his campaign in Pennsylvania last month and then flew back to Connecticut on a private jet the next day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=168.0s)]
*  Now, McCormick tried to justify his Connecticut residence by claiming he's just a good family man. His daughter lives there, apparently, which, you know, good for him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=183.0s)]
*  But again, I'm not sure Pennsylvanians are buying it. Like, there's lots of Pennsylvanians. Get one of them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=191.0s)]
*  Senator Ferderman got back in on the auction with his meme today mocking the second straight PA Republican Senate candidate who does not live in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=197.0s)]
*  It is genuinely downright bizarre that in a state with millions of people and lots of Republicans, they really cannot find a single Republican who actually lives in Pennsylvania to run for Senate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=206.0s)]
*  It went disastrously last time they did this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=218.0s)]
*  I guess we'll see how it goes this time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=222.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CRdCWYl2s&t=227.0s)]
