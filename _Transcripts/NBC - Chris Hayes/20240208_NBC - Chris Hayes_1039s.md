# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Feb. 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs)
*  We delivered a bipartisan bill to fix the border with the Republican senator appointed by the Republican caucus to cut the deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=0.0s)]
*  And within 24 hours before the ink was even dry, Republican senators decided they don't want a bipartisan bill to fix the border. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=13.0s)]
*  They want to pretend they never asked for a bipartisan border bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=23.0s)]
*  Because what they actually want is chaos. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=29.0s)]
*  Because that's what Donald Trump says he wants. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=33.0s)]
*  What the hell just happened? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=37.0s)]
*  Today, Senate Republicans killed a border deal, they voted it down, that they themselves had demanded and spent months negotiating. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=41.0s)]
*  It's all part of a sustained effort to appreciably damage our country, to make things worse in America so that Donald Trump has a better chance of being elected running against an incumbent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=50.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=62.0s)]
*  If you think that is hyperbole, okay, I want you to listen to the very conservative, I mean, really conservative Republican senator who was the key to negotiating this deal, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=63.0s)]
*  appointed by his caucus to do so, James Langford of Oklahoma, on the floor of the Senate today, explaining what the hell just happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=75.0s)]
*  I had a popular commentator four weeks ago that I talked to that told me flat out before they knew any of the contents of the bill, any of the content, nothing was out at that point, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=83.0s)]
*  that told me flat out, if you try to move a bill that solves the border crisis during this presidential year, I will do whatever I can to destroy you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=98.0s)]
*  Because I do not want you to solve this during the presidential election. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=110.0s)]
*  Seems pretty clear what happened with the Republican senators who voted to sink this deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=115.0s)]
*  One of the people who worked closely with Senator Langford, who had a front row seat to this entire spectacle, is Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the chief Democratic negotiator on this deal, and he joins me now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=120.0s)]
*  So Senator, it was like a week and a half ago when this bill was coming together, and I was reporting on it, and I was talking to various people, and people were wondering what was going to be in it, and I was talking to our team here, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=130.0s)]
*  I was like, let's get Senator Murphy, I want to argue with him about the provisions of this border bill. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=140.0s)]
*  But that's, we're not going to do that interview because it died. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=145.0s)]
*  At some point in the future we'll argue about what's in it, but let's just table that for a moment, okay? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=148.0s)]
*  I want to just retrace this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=154.0s)]
*  For my 20 years covering this issue, the trade is this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=157.0s)]
*  They want more border security and enhancement. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=160.0s)]
*  Democrats want a path to citizenship. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=163.0s)]
*  This time around, the negotiation didn't have a path to citizenship. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=166.0s)]
*  It was entirely on their terms in order to get Ukraine funding, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=170.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, Chris, that's been a failed play for 20 years. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=179.0s)]
*  So you are right that that has been the Democratic strategy for 30 years, maybe, and it has failed to deliver for the people we care about most, the undocumented Americans that are in this country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=182.0s)]
*  This is also not 2013 any longer when we ran that play last. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=195.0s)]
*  Back then there were a couple hundred people showing up every day applying for asylum. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=200.0s)]
*  Today on some days there are 8,000. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=204.0s)]
*  And the reality is, is that the bulk of this country does not think that that's right or sustainable and wants us to change the reality at the border. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=207.0s)]
*  So I know there's a temptation for Democrats, and I know you weren't looking for this argument, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=215.0s)]
*  but I think there is a temptation to just run the same play we always run because we know how to run it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=220.0s)]
*  But when it hasn't worked and when the country is actually demanding that we do something to make the border more manageable, I do think we have a right and responsibility to adjust to that reality. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=225.0s)]
*  Now, this bill still had in it some really important things for migrant rights, including a right to representation and earlier work permits and the biggest expansion of visas in 30 years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=236.0s)]
*  It's not a pathway to citizenship, but it is something substantial for people that actually care about migrants. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=246.0s)]
*  But in the end, all of this didn't matter because, as it turns out, Republicans are just absolutely allergic to fixing the problem at the border because they are so used to having this be their perennial election year issue. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=253.0s)]
*  They just couldn't give it up in the end. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=268.0s)]
*  So they asked James Lankford to cut this deal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=270.0s)]
*  He did exactly what they asked. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=272.0s)]
*  Mitch McConnell was in the room for the entirety of the negotiation, and in the end, even Mitch McConnell voted against it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=274.0s)]
*  Only three others joined James Lankford on the floor today to support the bipartisan border fix bill. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=280.0s)]
*  What's interesting in your response there, I can sense from you that you spent a lot of time working on this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=285.0s)]
*  This wasn't a you like you were proud of this bill like you like to your point, like on the substance, on the merits. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=290.0s)]
*  It's like it wasn't like, well, we have to do this to get X, Y and Z. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=297.0s)]
*  And we're back into a political corner like you think that this is a real issue, that there were real serious people trying to do it in a way that was going to be a classic sort of give and take half a loaf situation, but was going to be better than status quo and basically make things better for the country at the border. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=301.0s)]
*  Like a net improvement that you were proud to go around and try to get votes for and pass and have law become law. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=319.0s)]
*  Listen, I think you were watching the issue of migration take down left and center left governments all around the world right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=327.0s)]
*  I think we are at the point where if we didn't bring some sense of order to the border, if we didn't make a big down payment on reform to the asylum system, we were going to have a really hard time holding on to a consensus in this country that we should keep legal immigration pathways allowed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=337.0s)]
*  And so I am of the belief that this was a moment where you had to show some big bipartisan momentum and progress on the border, or you would never ever have the ability to try to rescue the undocumented Americans that desperately need help. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=355.0s)]
*  So, yes, I was ready to sell this bill to my colleagues. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=372.0s)]
*  And, of course, my Democratic colleagues did support it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=376.0s)]
*  I think about 80, 90 percent of Democrats voted for it today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=380.0s)]
*  80, 90 percent of Republicans voted against it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=383.0s)]
*  And the silver lining here is that at least we know where Republicans are. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=385.0s)]
*  Republicans have definitively decided that they want chaos at the border. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=389.0s)]
*  They don't want to solve this problem. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=393.0s)]
*  And maybe, maybe an issue that a lot of folks thought was going to be a net negative for Democrats going into the election has the ability to at least draw us even as more people just don't believe Republicans arguments that they want to do something about. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=395.0s)]
*  I mean, the thing that's there's two things that are striking to me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=409.0s)]
*  And again, you've been working on this for 20 years. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=411.0s)]
*  I've been covering it for 20 years. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=413.0s)]
*  You know, people forget they did have unified control of all of governance for two years when Donald Trump was elected and they did squat, bupkis, nothing, zero. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=415.0s)]
*  They cut corporations taxes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=423.0s)]
*  OK, so like it's like if you don't like if you don't like the negotiation you have to do with Democrats, you could have done it yourself and you didn't. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=425.0s)]
*  But second of all, what Langford said today, it's like I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=431.0s)]
*  I don't know how much in the end reality is going to matter to the marginal swing voter. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=436.0s)]
*  But for him to come out and be like, they my colleagues killed this because it's an election year and they want Donald Trump to win. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=442.0s)]
*  Like, that's plain as day. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=450.0s)]
*  Those are the facts of what happened. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=452.0s)]
*  And do you think in the end that will matter to the politics of the issue? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=454.0s)]
*  Well, you know that it only matters if we repeat it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=460.0s)]
*  And I do think that Democrats, especially over the last several years, have become so used to being on the defensive on this issue of immigration that we just refuse to talk about it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=464.0s)]
*  And we let Republicans define the issue. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=475.0s)]
*  We now have the opportunity to go on the offensive, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=478.0s)]
*  We have the receipts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=481.0s)]
*  We can show people that there was a breakthrough bipartisan bill that, if passed, would have brought some order to the border. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=483.0s)]
*  Frankly, the reason Republicans turned against it was because we did too good a job. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=490.0s)]
*  We actually were going to give President Biden tools that would be able to control numbers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=494.0s)]
*  And Republicans couldn't imagine a world in which they didn't have the border to run on this November. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=500.0s)]
*  So I think we can flip the script on Republicans. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=508.0s)]
*  I wasn't looking to gain political advantage. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=511.0s)]
*  I was trying to solve a problem, but they don't want to solve the problem. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=514.0s)]
*  So our obligation is to go on offense and explain to voters that Republicans are not sincere when they say they want to fix the problem because they had an opportunity. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=517.0s)]
*  And almost to a person, they ran for the hills. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=526.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, who spent a lot of time on that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=531.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's being a U.S. Senator in our day and age. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=534.0s)]
*  Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=538.0s)]
*  One of the challenges President Joe Biden faces in our current information environment and a Donald Trump media environment in particular is how to communicate just how much this administration and Democrats in Congress have actually gotten done. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=541.0s)]
*  It's been a lot. For example, the last two years have been the most productive years for U.S. climate efforts ever. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=552.0s)]
*  We are still not on trajectory to meet our Paris climate targets. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=558.0s)]
*  But for the first time, it actually seems like we have a shot at making it almost entirely thanks to the Inflation and Production Act passed without a single Republican vote. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=562.0s)]
*  One of the people who first championed the early version of the climate plan as the Green New Deal is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat in New York, and she joins me now. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=572.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you on. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=581.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I encounter, I think, particularly in social media dominated spaces where most sort of people under 30 get their news, is there's like a kind of really intense doomerism and kind of negativity that just sort of comes with the media, right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=583.0s)]
*  More than anything. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=598.0s)]
*  But I think it shapes people's views of politics. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=599.0s)]
*  And when I tell people that like emissions are setting all time lows, like solar deployment setting all time highs, like people don't know that we've actually kind of had a pretty good few years on climate stuff. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=602.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it almost feels like when you remind folks of that they think you're being the buzzkill for the buzzkills. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=615.0s)]
*  And it is important for us to communicate that we are winning. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=622.0s)]
*  And this isn't just about a political context. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=630.0s)]
*  This isn't even about cheerleading the president, although his leadership and willingness to work and make climate a priority is important to note. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=634.0s)]
*  But this is really about a story of people's movements winning. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=643.0s)]
*  This is about frontline activists winning. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=648.0s)]
*  This is about young people, you know, like like the Sunrise Movement, bird dogging senators and making this issue front and center and completely politically unforgettable and politically urgent that we pass the largest US federal climate investment in American history. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=651.0s)]
*  And that has translated already to nearly a quarter million jobs that have already been created of nine million jobs that are estimated to be created in the next several years. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=671.0s)]
*  I got to ask you about just the Hill the last few days because it really has been crazy and weird. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=683.0s)]
*  And just what you make of the my orcas impeachment and the fact that they're the first attempt to impeach a cabinet secretary in one hundred fifty years and they miscounted the votes and they're going to try again on Tuesday. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=690.0s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=702.0s)]
*  I mean, I let's just call a spade a spade here. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=705.0s)]
*  Republicans are dealing with not their first choice speaker, not their second choice speaker, not their third choice speaker. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=711.0s)]
*  They're dealing with the speaker that they could get and that they could agree on. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=717.0s)]
*  And that means an individual that does not have experience in party leadership that is a relative newcomer when it comes to the tenure of member that you're used to seeing when when they typically get the speaker's gavel. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=723.0s)]
*  And that means that the experience and vote counting is not quite up to the standard that we usually see in a speaker. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=741.0s)]
*  You're also dealing with the fact that this is an impeachment without merit. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=749.0s)]
*  Secretary Majorca has demonstrated no there is absolutely no evidence for an impeachable offense. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=753.0s)]
*  It is completely politicized. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=762.0s)]
*  It imperils the Republicans own swing district members to force a vote on something so clearly craven and without merit that I think you see what happened last night. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=764.0s)]
*  All of that coming together and the fact that they think that Democrats owe it to Republicans to give them, you know, their their their counts. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=777.0s)]
*  There are our attendance counts is laughable. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=788.0s)]
*  It really speaks to the fact that you're working with people who are not used to being in this chamber. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=791.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were mad that they mad and know them told them that Al Green was going to become like wheeling back in scrubs from abdominal surgery like you should have given them a heads up. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=797.0s)]
*  You didn't expect Al Green to be doing that. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=805.0s)]
*  Then you don't know who Al Reverend and Representative Al Green is. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=808.0s)]
*  He will do that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=812.0s)]
*  He will do it as demonstrated yesterday. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=814.0s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=816.0s)]
*  I want to ask a question about something the Congressional Budget Office and you tweeted this because I've been maddened by the discussion of immigrants, which basically I feel like the entire discussion is they're coming to take your stuff. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=818.0s)]
*  There's like only seven slices of pizza in America and everyone that comes is going to take one of those slices and you're not going to have any and the Congressional Budget Office basically said today, Look, we're readjusting our projection of GDP growth. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=830.0s)]
*  Up by seven trillion and also we're reading the US government money to reduce the deficit by a trillion because of immigration, higher net immigration and you tweeted that being like guys, we're not talking at all about the net positives immigrants bring to this country. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=843.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=860.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=863.0s)]
*  It is actually completely nonsensical that we do not talk about the enormous blessing, economic blessing that immigrants and immigration represents to the United States of America. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=864.0s)]
*  And a lot of folks sometimes think that this is just a certain kind of immigrant, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=878.0s)]
*  Like college educated or technical visas, all immigrants that we're seeing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=883.0s)]
*  This is the CBO estimate. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=889.0s)]
*  Immigration writ large is yielding enormous economic benefits to the United States. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=890.0s)]
*  And let's bring this out even finer. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=896.0s)]
*  If you are a caregiver, if you are a baby boomer, if you are someone that cares for someone who is aging, we currently do not have the economic or social structural capacity to take care of our seniors. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=898.0s)]
*  And we will increasingly not have that if we quote unquote lock up our border and shut down, shut down immigration. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=915.0s)]
*  In fact, the thing that has distinguished US economic performance from other countries like Japan or other, you know, other developed economies is the fact that our pro immigration policies actually allow us to continue in our economic growth. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=922.0s)]
*  Whereas similar countries with anti or more kind of closed border policies experience economic stagnation when they submit themselves to this xenophobic kind of border panic narrative that Fox News frankly seeks to peddle and instill in so many people quickly in the last 20 seconds. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=939.0s)]
*  I know you are no on the supplemental for Israel, barring some sort of strings attached on that aid. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=958.0s)]
*  You said that we're seeing Gaza slaughter on a speech yesterday and the floor. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=964.0s)]
*  How many Democrats are in that position? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=969.0s)]
*  Is do you have? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=971.0s)]
*  Is there a rough count of how many nos there are in the caucus? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=972.0s)]
*  What I will say is that the grassroots activism around a bilateral ceasefire is working and there are far more members than perhaps maybe publicly visible that have a lot of trepidation around voting for an for for an aid package. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=977.0s)]
*  That contains a no humanitarian aid and B, I think we are crossing the Rubicon here in just no holds barred, completely unconditional aid to the Israeli government. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=993.0s)]
*  We have leaky laws on the books that prevent USA from funding gross human rights violations. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=1004.0s)]
*  And we, I think, are seeing a level of depravity in Gaza that is becoming morally untenable to support. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=1010.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjXgtyuJTWs&t=1023.0s)]
