# ‘Disastrous position:’ The DeSantis bid to be the anti-vaccine candidate
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY)
*  It has been one week since Ron DeSantis made it official, taking on Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=0.0s)]
*  And he's made it clear that he thinks the way to beat Trump is to always run to Trump's right, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=6.2s)]
*  to be the true conservative against the pretender Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=11.88s)]
*  It's why he thinks he has a comparative advantage if he runs against the one thing the last administration [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=15.4s)]
*  unequivocally did right, the COVID vaccine and Operation Warp Speed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=21.36s)]
*  The way they weaponized these COVID vaccines was a massive incursion into our freedoms. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=26.32s)]
*  They wanted to deny people the right to put food on their table if they didn't bend the knee [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=33.6s)]
*  and get a COVID shot that they may not have wanted and that many of them did not need. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=39.64s)]
*  We can never allow Warp Speed to trump informed consent in this country ever again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=44.64s)]
*  DeSantis can't bring himself to say the name Trump except sort of smuggle it in there at the end of that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=52.84s)]
*  He thinks that position is a winner. He's been touting his anti-vax record in almost every some speech. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=58.68s)]
*  But while it might be tactically enticing way to distinguish himself from Trump, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=64.36s)]
*  I personally think it's strategically disastrous from a political point of view. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=69.08s)]
*  His competition thinks so too. One Trump super PAC just released an attack ad [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=72.92s)]
*  pointing out that DeSantis was all for vaccines before he was against them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=76.92s)]
*  We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you this important public service announcement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=82.36s)]
*  So my view is is if you get a vaccine, the vaccines are effective, you're immune. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=87.88s)]
*  If you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, the chance of you getting seriously ill or dying from COVID [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  is effectively zero. The vaccines protect you, get vaccinated. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=101.0s)]
*  So that's Team Trump attacking DeSantis for being pro-Trump vaccine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=106.12s)]
*  Because Juan DeSantis clearly thinks now that running as the unfettered anti-vaccine candidate [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  is the way to go. But again, it seems like a truly disastrous position to hold in the general election. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Margie O'Meara is a Democratic strategist and pollster. Tim Miller is a former RNC spokesman, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=121.0s)]
*  now a writer at large from the bulwark and both join me now. I should note, Tim, you wrote about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=125.72s)]
*  this, I should note that it isn't just, I mean, you could do the, you know, vaccine mandates is a sort [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=130.92s)]
*  of soft version of this. But the other day someone was yelling at Trump with like anti-vax heckling [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=135.64s)]
*  at an event and the DeSantis people tweeted it about how he didn't talk about how all the people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  that the vaccines hurt, right? Like much more than like the mandates, like the actual vaccine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=145.88s)]
*  You wrote this as expected DeSantis hits Trump from the anti-vax, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=151.16s)]
*  The two best things Trump did, Operation Warp Speed and First Step Act are the first attacks out of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=155.0s)]
*  the gate. At what point does this become too much for remaining normie RS to swallow? Do you think [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  he sticks with this? I do. I think DeSantis has made the calculation that the answer to my last [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=163.88s)]
*  question there is that normie RS will stick with him no matter what, because he's a better bet [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  for them than Donald Trump and they're so desperate to get rid of, to get rid of Donald. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=175.0s)]
*  And so I think DeSantis has decided that he has no risk, at least in the primary, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=178.92s)]
*  it's the primary discussion, Maggie can talk about the general, no risk in the primary on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=183.0s)]
*  that center right flank. Eventually people will line up behind him. He's not worried about the Tim [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=186.28s)]
*  Scots of the world and that he can find issues where he can outflank Trump on the MAGA right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=190.92s)]
*  And this is one of them. And I just think that this to that tweet that he said that DeSantis [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=197.32s)]
*  warrants that yesterday, I thought this was so telling Trump in that same speech where he got [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  heckled about side effects of the Vax called the person that killed Ashley Babbitt a thug. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, the DeSantis campaign does not defend the Capitol police that defends the Capitol. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=212.76s)]
*  And they could have said nothing about the Trump speech. They could have attacked him over that, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=217.64s)]
*  but instead they chose to attack him for defending the vaccine. I just think that's very telling [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=221.0s)]
*  about what they think their strategic play is here. Yeah. And I, again, I think the primary [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  is distinct. I won't pretend to know Margie. I'm curious what you think of this in the general. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Like if you're going to spend six to 10 months running as the anti-vax candidate, again, not [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=234.2s)]
*  just vaccine mandates, which I think you're is there sort of more cross pressure views on, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=239.32s)]
*  but like the anti-vax candidate, which I think he's flirting with and sometimes endorsing, like [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=244.04s)]
*  how do you what does the polling say? What do you think about that as a general election issue? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, right? Because for a long time, you had a lot of Republican leaders [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=253.72s)]
*  wanting to tell people to forget about COVID, ignore COVID, forget about it. But now they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  encouraging their voters to really think about this in a way that's really at odds with where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=262.68s)]
*  they were a little while ago. And if this worked as a strategy in the general election, you would [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=267.8s)]
*  have seen Republicans more successful in 2022 around the country. There were lots of governors, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=272.36s)]
*  races, Senate races, congressional races, local races, where you have Republicans trying to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=277.32s)]
*  go back to the times and harken back to the times of school closures and use that as something. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=282.76s)]
*  And that's different from the vaccine, but Jason, and it didn't work because people are now looking [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=287.8s)]
*  forward. And now as time has moved on to go back again, I think it's going to be hard. Now, polling [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=292.6s)]
*  we did for Navigator shows most Republicans say that they have received the vaccine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=298.52s)]
*  About two thirds of say they received the vaccine. It's about 14 percent of the country [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=303.32s)]
*  that are Republicans who have not received the vaccine. So it's not really enough to have a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  general election strategy. That doesn't mean that all those voters are going to vote based on that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=314.76s)]
*  Doesn't mean there aren't voters who have had the vaccine and might vote based on that. But it's a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=318.84s)]
*  sign that this is not a unifying message. The first point you make there, I want to go back [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=324.68s)]
*  to you, Tim. I think it's such a smart one because there's there's the specifics of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=330.04s)]
*  vaccine messaging, which I think is actually just like substantively incredibly dangerous and that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=333.24s)]
*  we've unnecessarily lost hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans because of. And I will [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=336.68s)]
*  never forgive the people that played a part in that, to be totally honest. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=342.68s)]
*  But there's also just this political question of like being obsessed looking back. And I think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=346.92s)]
*  there's something, Marjorie, you're putting a finger on Tim. People on the right, particularly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=351.32s)]
*  like the most like, you know, part of the base, are very obsessed with 2020. They're obsessed with [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  like the George Floyd protests. They're obsessed with the Trump election. They're obsessed with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=362.12s)]
*  like the media and Hunter Biden and why they didn't put that. They're obsessed with the COVID [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=367.8s)]
*  policies. It is like this fuel, this of rage. And I think it's driving a lot of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=372.36s)]
*  Republican based politics in a way that the rest of the country is like really trying not to think [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=381.16s)]
*  about that anymore. Yeah. And it makes you seem kind of weird and obsessive, right? To be continuing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=385.56s)]
*  to talk about this. But I do think it's true that it's bottom up. I went to the Charlie Gurt group, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  I went to their conference back in December. Exactly those issues that you just talked about, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=397.48s)]
*  COVID, George Floyd, woke, 2020 election fraud. Like that's what was animating the attendees that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  I talked to, right? And so that's why the politicians are talking about this. Just one other [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=407.8s)]
*  thing to my point with the risk DeSantis plays here, I think, is a big part of his argument [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=411.48s)]
*  with the soft mega voters, right? Is that he's more electable than Trump. And so I think the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  more he flirts with this kind of stuff, there's this unforeseen risk of him going far out to the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=423.88s)]
*  right and seeming weird, seeming out of touch, and having those voters look at Trump kind of like [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=427.56s)]
*  they looked at Trump and Cruz and thought that Trump was the more mainstream one. And I think [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=433.32s)]
*  this is a risk that DeSantis plays why the general election and primary politics interplay with each [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=437.4s)]
*  other. And there's one more thing, Margie, and I think this has to do with the complexities of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=442.44s)]
*  politics, which is that people think about Trump as beating everyone in that primary from the right, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=446.76s)]
*  but he didn't. He was sort of to the left on a bunch of things. The Iraq war, which he said he [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=451.0s)]
*  opposed, although he hadn't, on entitlements and social insurance, social security, Medicare. He [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=455.48s)]
*  supported universal health care. He is attacking DeSantis from the left on social security and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=461.32s)]
*  Medicare on a national sales tax, which was a big sort of like right wing plan, right? We're going [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=467.8s)]
*  to get rid of the income tax. It strikes me that that's actually pretty effective stuff, even in a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=472.92s)]
*  Republican primary. I'm curious what you think the polling shows. Yeah, I mean, it goes to show that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=477.24s)]
*  politics is not always about just voting for a list of policy positions, especially when it comes [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=483.24s)]
*  to Trump. People are voting for, and it's not just Trump, this is true with a lot of elections, who [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=489.24s)]
*  do they feel is fighting for them? Who cares about them? Who would, you know, go out and fight for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=493.88s)]
*  you? Who wants to meet you, wants to talk to you, understands you, gets you? And a lot of Republicans [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=500.36s)]
*  feel that way about Trump. It's less about the litany of a variety of policy positions. And that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=506.52s)]
*  has made some of this very complicated, both for Democrats and Republicans. Republicans who say, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=511.88s)]
*  hey, conservatism means this. It doesn't mean spending on all these programs. And for Democrats [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=516.92s)]
*  who say, you know, well, Republicans, you know, are all over the place and you're inconsistent. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=523.0s)]
*  Margie O'Mara and Tim Miller, thank you both. Have a great weekend. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=527.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIjLLktuBNY&t=536.52s)]
