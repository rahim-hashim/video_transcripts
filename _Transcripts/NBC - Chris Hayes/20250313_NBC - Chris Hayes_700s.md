# 'I knew I'd get criticized': Schumer on why he's helping Republicans avoid shutdown
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8)
*  Senate Democrats are split over how they will vote on the Republican plan to keep the government funded, though on Elon Musk and Donald Trump's terms. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's budget director, and this is key, is already reportedly preparing to ignore the spending appropriated in the bill. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=8.44s)]
*  Some Democrats have said they will not support the plan, even if it means a government shutdown. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York says he will support the vote basically to get the bill in a position to pass and to keep the government open. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=21.0s)]
*  For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=33.92s)]
*  It is not a clean CR. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=39.64s)]
*  It is deeply partisan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=42.32s)]
*  It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=43.68s)]
*  But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even more, even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=47.84s)]
*  And Senator Chuck Schumer joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=58.96s)]
*  Senator, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=63.44s)]
*  Let's just start on this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=64.48s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people watching this right now who are confused about this decision. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=65.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=71.92s)]
*  Or upset by it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=72.64s)]
*  So just spell out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=73.6s)]
*  Just give me your logic, particularly on this sort of on the one hand, on the other. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=74.88s)]
*  What is the cost you see to the constitutional order of a shutdown that isn't already being done now? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=77.91999999999999s)]
*  It's a dramatic cost. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=85.64s)]
*  Here's why, Chris. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  Under a shutdown, it is the executive branch, in this case, Trump, Musk, Doge and Vought, who's head of the OMB, who we all know are authoritarians, vicious, nasty, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=88.44s)]
*  who would have sole control over what is funded and what isn't. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=102.44s)]
*  They get to determine what is a, quote, essential service. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=106.16s)]
*  And they will just cut to smithereens far greater than in the CR bill, which is a lousy bill, far greater than that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=110.08s)]
*  What could be funded and what couldn't? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  And there's no recourse. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=120.0s)]
*  You can't go to court. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=121.36s)]
*  This is a decision totally in the executive branch. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=122.36s)]
*  And so it would be devastating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=125.28s)]
*  Why is it that Elon Musk and Donald Trump want a government shutdown so they can take control of the government and do their vicious, horrible things? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  They could cut half the government. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=136.08s)]
*  They could tell employees you're not essential and never bring them back permanently firing them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=138.0s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=143.16s)]
*  And in a few weeks, if there was a shutdown, everyone would be complaining and howling. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=144.76s)]
*  Why did they cut? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=150.16s)]
*  Why did they eliminate SNAP? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=151.28s)]
*  Why did they cut so much of Medicaid? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=152.96s)]
*  But they could do all that on their own. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=155.76s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=158.4s)]
*  There is no check on them with a shutdown. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  That's not to say this CR bill is a good bill. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=161.4s)]
*  It isn't. It didn't have any safeguards in it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=163.52s)]
*  But it would be much, much worse to have a shutdown. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=165.88s)]
*  And my job, Chris, as leader, is to see things a little bit ahead down the road and see how horrible this would be and alert people to it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=168.8s)]
*  So I want to sort of present two arguments on the other side. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=175.72s)]
*  One of them is that I was I was it was quite and I hear you on this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=179.16s)]
*  I think it doesn't. This is not an easy call. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=182.56s)]
*  I want to be clear. I mean, I don't think it is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=184.16s)]
*  But, you know, the AFGE union, which is the largest union representing federal workers, they're in they won a big victory today in federal court about those probationary employees. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=185.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  They came out against the CR, which really surprised me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=197.32s)]
*  Right. These are the people that seem to have the most skin in the game on precisely the terms you're enunciating. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  And they said the fact that this CR has no protections that will actually be followed means that we can't support it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  If the people whose livelihoods are on the line say you have to you cannot go along with this thing, why are they wrong? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=213.12s)]
*  I understand why they're so upset with the CR. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=221.0s)]
*  But I disagree with them because the shutdown would be worse for their employees. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=223.56s)]
*  They could just eliminate huge portions of government workers automatically. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=228.36s)]
*  They could eliminate programs automatically, which they can't do on the CR. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=233.56s)]
*  The CR has certain spending and they can screw around with it and they will. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=237.4s)]
*  But these guys are sons of guns. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=241.2s)]
*  They're going to do everything they can to hurt the government. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  You know what they've talked about. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=246.76s)]
*  Elon Musk, this billionaire who cares nothing about taking people's Social Security away. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  This guy says that he wants to cut two trillion dollars out of the federal government. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=254.76s)]
*  A shutdown would allow him to do it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=259.08s)]
*  And here's another point, Chris. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=260.52s)]
*  There's no exit ramp. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  Anyone who wants the shutdown, I've asked them, well, how do we get out of it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=263.64s)]
*  Guess who it's up to to get out of it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump, Elon Musk, doge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=268.88s)]
*  So it's a horrible, it's two bad alternatives. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=272.52s)]
*  And I respect people who actually want, you know, don't want it vote for the CR. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=275.76s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=280.88s)]
*  But with the alternative being a government shutdown, that's even worse. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=281.88s)]
*  So here's the other the other sort of way that I've heard people phrase this, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=286.12s)]
*  Democrats don't control any part of the government. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=292.12s)]
*  So there's not a ton of leverage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=295.44s)]
*  The one thing they have leverage is in the Senate where you need a filibuster proof [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=296.88s)]
*  majority on a cloture vote. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=300.68s)]
*  That there is essentially an unconstitutional assault on the government right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=303.2s)]
*  And I think you would agree with that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=307.64s)]
*  There is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=308.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=309.64s)]
*  These guys are the worst and we got to fight them every step of the way. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=310.64s)]
*  As we say in Brooklyn, Chris, every step of the way. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=315.08s)]
*  But look, Russell is telling people, but he's telling people on the floor, we are not even [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=318.44s)]
*  going to listen to the CR. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=323.56s)]
*  This is a people paper that we will impound and rip up the moments it's passed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=325.28s)]
*  If that's the case, how is voting for cloture not essentially an imprimatur on the very [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  same assault on the constitutional order? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=336.2s)]
*  They're already even without this CR. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  They're already doing it right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=341.2s)]
*  OK, they are going to they did it to the Department of Education. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  But I can tell you, I've been through shutdowns before the all. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=346.28s)]
*  It's not that this CR is good. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not that voting for it is good. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=351.55999999999995s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=353.32s)]
*  But the alternative is worse. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  And we have to look just a month ahead and see how bad a shutdown would be for all the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=356.12s)]
*  things we believe in and how I'd say Trump and Doge and Musk and vote. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  They're like drooling with happiness and desire to get a government shutdown. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=368.6s)]
*  They've said they want it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=373.04s)]
*  Why not? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=374.36s)]
*  We're doing anything good. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=375.36s)]
*  I'll tell you that these guys are authoritarians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me just say with this in one second. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=380.76s)]
*  I think the theory of the case for people that don't want Democrats to vote for cloture [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=382.16s)]
*  is that Americans don't quite understand what's being done to their government. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=387.44s)]
*  It's being done in this sort of haphazard fashion. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  The stories are sort of getting out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  There's this forest service worker who got laid off for no reason. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=396.68s)]
*  And there's this veteran who's got a traumatic brain injury, who's got a clinical trial. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  But that the shutdown would be a way of actually calling the question. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=404.56s)]
*  And here's here's what I would just offer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=409.48s)]
*  It seems to me that the demand that makes the most sense here, and I'm not a U.S. senator, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=411.76s)]
*  is for the Republicans to vote on a rescission package that enunciates the cuts Doge has [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=416.8s)]
*  done as opposed to allowing an unelected co-president unilaterally eviscerate the American constitutional [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=422.76s)]
*  power of the purse. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  Well the bottom line is the Republican Senate is in total obeisance to Trump. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=432.44s)]
*  They're not going to oppose him in any way. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=437.56s)]
*  But if they allow Trump to make the kind of drastic cuts that I greatly fear in a government [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=440.8s)]
*  shutdown, they'll be culpable as well. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=447.64s)]
*  And make no mistake about it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=450.76s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=452.64s)]
*  Ask yourself again the question, why does Musk and Trump and vote want this? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=454.64s)]
*  on how to slash the government far worse than slashed in the C.R. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=462.68s)]
*  Much worse. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=468.0s)]
*  Every program, every part of government would be at their disposal, their wicked disposal. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=469.08s)]
*  So that's the problem here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=474.68s)]
*  It's not that the C.R. is good, it's horrible. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=476.14s)]
*  And all things being equal, we should have opposed it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=478.68s)]
*  But the alternative being a shutdown makes things worse. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=481.56s)]
*  And I believe this much worse. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  And I believe this, I wouldn't have done this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  I knew I'd get criticized, but I felt obligated for the country, for my Democratic caucus, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=488.64s)]
*  to the people, to explain how bad a shutdown would be. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=496.24s)]
*  And if we went into a shutdown and everything bad happened, I had to give people this warning. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=500.12s)]
*  Can I just keep you for two more questions if that's okay. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  One is a sort of question about strategy and dealing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=510.28s)]
*  What I think you and I and many people watching this agree is essentially an assault on the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=514.92s)]
*  Constitutional Order and that it's this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=518.28s)]
*  The only thing they understand is meeting conflict with conflict. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=520.72s)]
*  So if you look at Doug Ford in Ontario, who banged the table and said, you're going to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=526.04s)]
*  tariff us, I'm going to tariff you, we're going to put a surcharge on electricity, that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=530.24s)]
*  the only thing that gets their attention, the only thing that gets them to back down [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=535.48s)]
*  is meeting conflict with conflict. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  If you meet conflict with essentially managed retreat or strategic non-engagement, then [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=540.68s)]
*  they roll all over you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=547.84s)]
*  We are going to conflict with them on everything, on the tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=549.56s)]
*  They become a plutocracy and oligarchy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  On Medicaid. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=558.16s)]
*  We have plans to conflict them with all of that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=559.16s)]
*  If the shutdown occurred, we wouldn't be able to do that because they would fill up both [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=561.72s)]
*  the Senate and the discussion on whether we should cut this and not cut that, of things [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=566.4s)]
*  that they want to cut. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=572.76s)]
*  So to have the conflict on the best ground we have, summed up in a sentence, that they're [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=574.16s)]
*  making the middle class pay for tax cuts for billionaires, it's much, much better not to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=580.0s)]
*  be in the middle of a shutdown, which to divert people from the number one issue we have against [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=585.04s)]
*  these bastards, sorry, these people, which is not only all these cuts, but they're ruining [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=590.04s)]
*  democracy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=596.76s)]
*  And one other thing on a shutdown. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=597.76s)]
*  The courts could close or at least be totally, totally disabled. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=600.82s)]
*  And the courts are one of the best ways we've had to go after these guys. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  Final question about just an issue of inter-cameral strategy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=611.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Democrats voted en masse against this in the House. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  They lost only one vote, Jared Goldman in Maine. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  I've seen a lot of House members, across an ideological range, interestingly enough, urging [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=621.94s)]
*  the Senate to filibuster this, saying, look, this is existential about whether we control [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=628.3s)]
*  the power of the purse or not. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=632.42s)]
*  We cannot essentially sign off on this doge unilateral arrogation of this power. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=633.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, I supported what the House did to vote against this bill universally, but [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  that didn't cause a shutdown. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=647.66s)]
*  It's different in the Senate. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=650.14s)]
*  And I knew people were going to disagree with me, but I felt so strongly that the shutdown [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=651.8599999999999s)]
*  would be the greatest disaster we face with these arrogant, arrogant autocrats that we [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=656.78s)]
*  had to avoid the shutdown and fight on many of the other things, every other issue that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=663.1s)]
*  we have. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=669.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=670.06s)]
*  Senator Chuck Schumer, who's the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, announcing he [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=671.06s)]
*  will be a yes for cloture tomorrow. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=673.18s)]
*  I imagine you will have the six or so other votes you need to get that over the hump. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=674.5799999999999s)]
