# ‘Completely unhinged’: Harris allies blast Trump’s meltdown at NABJ interview
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk)
*  Good evening from Washington DC. I'm Michael Steele filling in for my friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Hayes tonight. We are waiting an appearance by Kamala Harris in Houston [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Texas in just about 15 minutes from now and we're going to bring that to you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=10.52s)]
*  live because oh man does she have a lot to talk about. This will be the first [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  time the vice president will have a public event since her opponent, you know [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=21.56s)]
*  him Donald Trump had an incredible debacle earlier today. When Donald Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=28.38s)]
*  went on stage to take questions at the largest annual convention of black [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=33.58s)]
*  journalists it is a challenging room to begin with for any politician to work [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=37.3s)]
*  even in the best of times but especially for Trump with his history of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=42.46s)]
*  controversial and racist statements just booking this interview caused [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=47.26s)]
*  resignations in the leadership of the National Association of Black Journalists [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=51.5s)]
*  and now I can understand why. I don't know if you saw the session but it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=55.18s)]
*  started late and it started with an announcement from moderator Rachel Scott [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=62.94s)]
*  the ABC News correspondent congressional reporter that Trump's answers would be [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=66.9s)]
*  fact-checked in real time on social media and from the very first question [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=71.42s)]
*  Trump handled it all like a consummate professional. No I'm actually just [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=76.82s)]
*  kidding it was Donald Trump. You have used words like animal and rabbit to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=82.34s)]
*  describe black district attorneys you've attacked black journalists calling them [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  a loser saying the questions that they ask are quote stupid and racist you've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=92.98s)]
*  had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort so my question sir [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=97.9s)]
*  now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you why should black voters [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  trust you after you have used language like that? Well first of all I don't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=107.94s)]
*  think I've ever been asked a question so in such a horrible manner first question [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  you don't even say hello how are you are you with ABC because I think they're a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=119.78s)]
*  fake news network a terrible network. Oh it got really bad after that things [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=125.7s)]
*  quickly deteriorated as Trump obsessed about the audacity of three journalists [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=133.66s)]
*  who all happened to be black women as they attempted to do journalism. I got [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=139.18s)]
*  treated so rudely as this woman and I'm fine with it because she it does it she [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=145.94s)]
*  was very rude sir very rude that was a nasty that wasn't a question she gave a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=152.78s)]
*  statement that wasn't a question. I repeated your statement. What's your plan for the black [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=159.5s)]
*  community when it comes to money? So first of all it's very hard to hear you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=163.54s)]
*  for whatever reason because of the fact that they have bad equipment because I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=167.66s)]
*  guess you know this woman was unable to get the right equipment. We have you for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=170.94s)]
*  a limited time sir I'd love to move on to different topics. You're the one that held me up at 35 minutes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=175.7s)]
*  I cannot understand your microphone. I know it is really hard for me to understand you. I can [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=179.7s)]
*  understand you perfectly. I can understand you. I'm happy to hear that sir. My question is on those rioters who assaulted officers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=187.7s)]
*  Would you pardon those people? Oh absolutely I would. If they're innocent I would pardon them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=197.7s)]
*  They've been convicted. And by the way the Supreme Court just under... Why come here? What is your message today? My message is to stop people from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=203.7s)]
*  invading our country. A lot of the journalists in this room are black. I will tell you that coming from the border are millions and millions of people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=215.7s)]
*  that happen to be taking black jobs. You had the best... What exactly is a black job sir? A black job is anybody that has a job. That's what it is. Anybody that has a job. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=226.7s)]
*  He was agitated. He was rude. He was racist. And yes he was weird. Just a few weeks ago Trump looked like he was cruising to a victory against an aging Joe Biden. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=238.7s)]
*  And making major inroads with minority voters. Now he's facing an uphill battle against Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=251.7s)]
*  And his appearance today was a crucial opportunity to flip the script. Instead Trump heaps scorn on his questioners and made things worse. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=259.7s)]
*  When he was asked about Republicans blasting Harris as a DEI hire he didn't just double down. No no. He invented a new kind of racist Kamala truth-a-rism on the fly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=269.7s)]
*  Is that acceptable language to you? And will you tell those Republicans and those supporters to stop it? How do you define DEI? Go ahead. How do you define it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=282.7s)]
*  Diversity, equity, inclusion. Okay yeah. Go ahead. Is that what your definition... That is literally the words. Give me a definition then. Would you give me a definition of that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=293.7s)]
*  Sir I'm asking you a question. No no you have to define it. Define it for me if you would. I just defined it sir. Do you believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is a black woman? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=302.7s)]
*  She was always of Indian heritage. And she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black. And now she wants to be known as black. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=311.7s)]
*  So I don't know. Is she Indian or is she black? She is always identified as a black woman. I respect either one. I respect either one but she obviously doesn't. Because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went...she became a black person. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=324.7s)]
*  Just to be clear sir, do you believe that she is a black woman? I think somebody should look into that too when you ask a continue in a very hostile nasty tone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=339.7s)]
*  In addition to defending immunity for killer cops, saying he'd part in January 6th rioters, and again calling himself the best president for black Americans since Abraham Lincoln, Trump also suggested Kamala Harris couldn't pass a cognitive test. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=347.7s)]
*  And he went on to deflect questions about his running mate J.D. Vance from another interviewer, semaphore politics reporter Kadia Goba, with flat out lies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=364.7s)]
*  I'm going to get my J.D. Vance question in. To your point and to Rachel's point, he has a lot of opinions about childless women like myself or divorced people like yourself. Do you think...well, I mean my point is here... [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=377.7s)]
*  But at least it was said in a friendly manner. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=395.7s)]
*  My point is...do you think the party, the Republican party is getting a little bit too judgy about people's lives when you think about abortion or when you think about what J.D. Vance is saying? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=396.7s)]
*  I don't think...look, I think that the Democrat party is really the one that has the problem. I think they're radical on abortion because they're allowing abortion in the 9th month. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=409.7s)]
*  They're allowing the death of a baby after the baby is born based on the governor of Virginia. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=419.7s)]
*  Look, it's the job of journalists to ask hard, uncomfortable questions. And convention organizers worked with PolitiFact to try and fact check Trump's rambling in real time on social media. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=430.7s)]
*  All he had to offer, though, was racially problematic disrespect to his questioners, along with the usual self-serving lies. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=442.7s)]
*  So here's the point. Is there any redeeming value to interviewing Donald Trump like this? Is that juice really worth the squeeze? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=451.7s)]
*  Kadija Gova is a political reporter for Semaphore. She was one of the three journalists who questioned Trump on that panel today. And she joins me now. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=462.7s)]
*  Ms. Gova, thank you so much. I know there's a moment where you kind of have to...you're sitting there and you're asking yourself, is this really happening? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=473.7s)]
*  Talk about how you approached this opportunity to question the president and how, to the rest of it, it just seemed to be a misalignment of assignments here for the president to actually come in and have a conversation with you, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=480.7s)]
*  and, ostensibly, with a very large black audience. And then you're also trying to ask him the tough question about, okay, this is what we know about you. How do you account for that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=497.7s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a great question, because I spent a lot of time going over questions and framing them in a way that I thought would elicit some kind of response from the former president. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=510.7s)]
*  If you have interviewed Donald Trump, you know that he is a very difficult interview. I just interviewed him about seven weeks ago in Mar-a-Lago. It is not easy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=527.7s)]
*  However, I did not expect some of the rhetoric that came or some of the initial pushback that came, and that accusatory tone at the very beginning and outright just assailing the panelists. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=540.7s)]
*  I didn't anticipate that at all. So while I crafted what I thought were really good questions, I felt like it was downplayed a little bit because of all the chaos that happened on the panel. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=554.7s)]
*  Yeah, well, it started off with the drama, you know, and the lateness of how it began, the fact that at about the 34-minute mark his campaign staff just killed the conversation, because it clearly was not good for the president for a whole host of reasons. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=568.7s)]
*  And so that leads me to ask this question. Do you think it was productive at all? Because there are a lot of people who are saying, why did that even take place? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=587.7s)]
*  I, for one, just to put my thought on the table real quick, yeah, I thought it was productive from the standpoint. We should hear what this man thinks about us as a community, what he thinks about the issues that he's going to confront as president. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=597.7s)]
*  But as a journalist, when you're planning this, if you had to do it all over again, would you do it? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=612.7s)]
*  I wouldn't miss an opportunity to interview a presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, I think, one. So, I mean, it's a great question whether or not, you know, the audience got what they needed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=618.7s)]
*  Again, you point out that this was an audience full of journalists. I feel like I got some questions. I got him on the record saying that he would take a cognitive test, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=634.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=643.7s)]
*  When we took office. And there were a few responses that we did get. Sadly, like you mentioned, it was a little overshadowed by some of what happened or the chaos on the panel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=644.7s)]
*  But to your point, listen, the American people need to understand what the, you know, a future president possibly would look like in front of a group of Black journalists or just journalists at large. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=657.7s)]
*  You know, I thought it was interesting that he came into a venue and said fake news with hundreds of journalists in front of him, right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=670.7s)]
*  So, I mean, I think Americans need to say, see that, maybe be reminded that this is who this candidate is, for better or for worse, you know, no judgment on my part. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=681.7s)]
*  But I think that's important to say. And like I said, we did get him on the record for a couple of questions. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=691.7s)]
*  No, you did. You got him on the record on a number of things. And I really applaud the professionalism of all three of you in approaching this interview. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=698.7s)]
*  And particularly when it started to go sideways, you did a remarkable job of holding composure, staying focused on the mission and, like you said, getting some news out of it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=707.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYWbDFWFwk&t=737.7s)]
