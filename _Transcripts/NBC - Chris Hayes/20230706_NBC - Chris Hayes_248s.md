# Wisconsin governor uses clever maneuver to fund schools for 400 years
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY)
*  Nearly every state in the country gives its governor some form of a line item veto power, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=0.0s)]
*  where they effectively get to take a red editor's pen to bills, crossing out certain aspects [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=7.08s)]
*  they don't like, and then sign the rest of the bill into law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=11.58s)]
*  Notably, that authority is not granted to the president of the United States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=15.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court struck down a federal line item veto back in 1998. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=18.8s)]
*  Despite Bill Clinton being president at the time, the federal line item veto is actually [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=24.2s)]
*  the brainchild of House Republicans, who saw it as a useful tool to rein in federal spending. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=27.68s)]
*  During his successful campaign for governor, Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker effectively [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=34.2s)]
*  said as much the same. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=38.58s)]
*  I have a line item veto just as powerful as the governor, as the county executive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=40.8s)]
*  That's one of the few things that county executives have that are different than anybody else. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=44.6s)]
*  I use that, I mean, simple to me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=48.68s)]
*  Economics 101, government 101 is you use the line item veto to eliminate or lower the cost [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=51.28s)]
*  of something in the budget. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=57.66s)]
*  Right, you use the line item veto to eliminate or lower the cost of something in the budget. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=59.63999999999999s)]
*  Well, in the last few days, two Democratic governors dealing with hostile Republican [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=63.26s)]
*  legislatures have managed to use the line item veto to score some pretty amazing political [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=66.94s)]
*  victories. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  So in Wisconsin, Democratic Governor Tony Evers is facing one of the most aggressively [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  gerrymandered legislatures in the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=77.34s)]
*  So Governor Evers had to get clever in order to fight for his priorities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, Wisconsin governors used to have an even more expansive line item veto power than they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=84.1s)]
*  do now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=88.22s)]
*  Quote, at one time, governors could veto individual words to create new individual letters to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=89.22s)]
*  create new words known as the Vanna White veto or strike words from two or more sentences [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=95.06s)]
*  to make new sentences known as the Frankenstein veto. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin governors cannot strike individual words and letters from bills anymore, probably [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=104.1s)]
*  for the best. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  There's nothing saying they can't fool around with numbers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  The governor also using his authority to ensure increased funding for public schools [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=113.5s)]
*  for the next 400 years and less changed by a future legislature and governor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=118.02s)]
*  The governor's move increasing each year how much revenue schools can raise. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=123.18s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=127.42s)]
*  Governor Evers extended school funding in Wisconsin by more than 400 years using the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=129.46s)]
*  line item veto. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=134.18s)]
*  You see, the legislature approved a funding in a boost in funding through the 2024-25 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=135.18s)]
*  school year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=141.44s)]
*  The governor took his handy veto pen, crossed out the 20 along with a hyphen, changing 2024-25 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=142.44s)]
*  to 2024-25. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=149.12s)]
*  So additional funding through the year 2024-25 will now be the law of the land in Wisconsin [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=151.16s)]
*  until someone comes along to change it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=157.12s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro also got creative with his veto power. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=159.6s)]
*  Shapiro negotiated an expansion of, again, public school funding, but he also had to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=164.36s)]
*  whip votes for a controversial compromise that would subsidize private schools with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=168.2s)]
*  voucher programs in order to pass the bill through the Republican controlled Senate, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  which it did last week. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=177.94s)]
*  And before it passed the Democratic House last night, Shapiro announced he's going to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=180.42s)]
*  use the line item veto on the school voucher program he helped negotiate and got it through [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=185.06s)]
*  the Senate after he used it as bait to get Republicans on board with his budget. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=189.82s)]
*  All this brings me back to two major points. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the case against the line item veto is pretty strong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=198.72s)]
*  I'm still a little unsouled. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=201.44s)]
*  It's the best thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  Going forward, probably find some bipartisan consensus to getting rid of it or at least [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=204.44s)]
*  reining it in in some ways. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=208.16s)]
*  But point number two, and this is the most important thing for Evers and Shapiro, when [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=209.44s)]
*  you are elected to office of either party, but in this case of Democrats, you've got [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=213.32s)]
*  to wield the power you have on things you believe in and that you promise to deliver. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  And Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, we got you pretty good examples of that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0rK2wdBMY&t=223.04000000000002s)]
