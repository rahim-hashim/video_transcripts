# ‘There’s hope’: Republicans break ranks to block anti-trans bills in Montana
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o)
*  Right now, Republicans are waging a campaign of persecution and discrimination against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=0.0s)]
*  trans people at basically every policy level across this country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=5.98s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, Republicans are openly attacking the first openly trans member of Congress, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=10.24s)]
*  Democrat Sarah McBride from Delaware, who we had the pleasure of having on the show. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  On Tuesday, Republican Congressman Keith Self of Texas repeatedly misgendered Congresswoman [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=18.36s)]
*  McBride during a hearing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=23.62s)]
*  They think this is funny or cool or makes them look tough or something. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=24.76s)]
*  And our colleague, Democrat Bill Keating of Massachusetts, modeled what it means to stand [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  up for your colleagues. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=34.24s)]
*  I now recognize the representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=35.24s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Chair. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=43.0s)]
*  Would you repeat what you just said when you introduced a duly elected representative from [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=44.0s)]
*  the United States of America? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Please. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=50.36s)]
*  I will. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=51.36s)]
*  The representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=52.4s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, you are out of order. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, have you no decency? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=59.0s)]
*  I mean, I have come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=61.56s)]
*  We will continue this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=65.96s)]
*  You will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=67.2s)]
*  right way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=71.8s)]
*  This hearing is adjourned. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=74.92s)]
*  Last year, we left hopeless by that genuinely enraging exchange. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=77.36s)]
*  We saw something close to the polar opposite unfold in the Montana State House last Thursday. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  So Republicans there hold a near two-thirds majority in the chamber. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=86.44s)]
*  Last week, they considered two anti-LGBTQ bills. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=90.2s)]
*  The first was a bill which sought to ban drag performances, almost certainly unconstitutional. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=93.84s)]
*  The second was a draconian bill which sought to remove trans kids from their parents. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=98.88s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=104.44s)]
*  Democrats, though, were not going down without a fight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=105.44s)]
*  You see, Montana has two trans or nonbinary Democrats elected to their state legislature, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=107.92s)]
*  and both of them delivered earnest, heartfelt speeches about why these bills should not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=113.08s)]
*  become law. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=118.0s)]
*  Representative Zoe Zephyr, who is trans, spoke out against the drag ban. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=120.04s)]
*  In committee, when the sponsor closed on this bill, he said, this bill is needed, he said, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=126.08s)]
*  and I quote his words, because transgenderism is a fetish based on cross-dressing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=133.92s)]
*  Those were his words for why this bill is necessary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=142.0s)]
*  And I'm here to stand before the body and say that my life is not a fetish. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=145.88s)]
*  My existence is not a fetish. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=152.66s)]
*  I was proud, it's been a month ago, to have my son up in the gallery here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=155.16s)]
*  Many of you on the other side met him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=162.62s)]
*  When I go to walk him to school, that is not a lascivious display. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=166.18s)]
*  That is not a fetish. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=172.06s)]
*  That is my family. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=174.02s)]
*  After Representative Zephyr spoke, a Republican representative, Sheri Essman, also took to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=177.18s)]
*  the floor against the bill. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  Trust the parents to do what's right and stop these crazy bills. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=185.78s)]
*  They're a waste of time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=191.18s)]
*  They're a waste of energy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=192.86s)]
*  We should be working on property tax relief and not doing this sort of business on the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=194.8s)]
*  floor of this House and having to even talk about this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=200.3s)]
*  Following those speeches, 13 Republicans flipped their votes against the drag ban, and it was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=204.46s)]
*  then defeated 15 to 44. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=208.38s)]
*  It went down that same day. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=211.22s)]
*  Representative S.J. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=213.38s)]
*  Howell, who's non-binary, delivered a speech of their own on the bill that would seek to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=214.38s)]
*  take trans kids away from their parents. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=218.66s)]
*  Put yourself in the shoes of a CPS worker who's confronted with a young person, 15 years [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=223.06s)]
*  old maybe, who is happy, healthy, living in a stable home with loving parents, who is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=228.46s)]
*  supported and has their needs met, and they are supposed to remove that child from that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=239.26s)]
*  home and put them into the care of the state. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=244.78s)]
*  We should absolutely not be doing this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=249.34s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=253.3s)]
*  Following that speech, 29 Republicans flipped their votes, and that bill was defeated overwhelmingly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=254.3s)]
*  71 to 27. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=259.26s)]
*  It is really easy these days to lose hope in just the basic mechanics of democracy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=261.98s)]
*  but here's an incredible shining example that shows it is not all for naught. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=266.62s)]
*  People can be persuaded away from cruelty and viciousness, and there is some hope on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=271.46s)]
*  the other side. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMR-F58Hb5o&t=277.14s)]
