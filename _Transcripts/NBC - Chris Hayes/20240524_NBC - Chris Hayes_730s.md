# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It has now been just over 24 hours since reporting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=0.0s)]
*  by the New York Times revealed that a flag championed by the far-right Christian Nationals [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=5.12s)]
*  movement, a flag displayed widely by January 6th insurrectionists as a storm the capital [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=9.78s)]
*  for Donald Trump, also flew all summer long last year over the beach house of Supreme [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=15.0s)]
*  Court Justice Samuel Alito. And of course, that news about that flag came just days after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=20.66s)]
*  we learned that Alito's home in Virginia also displayed an upside down American flag in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=26.18s)]
*  the weeks after the violent sacking of the Capitol. Another symbol adopted and embraced [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=31.3s)]
*  by Trump stopped the seal supporters. In that case, Alito responded to questions from the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=37.6s)]
*  Times with an emailed statement saying his wife, you know, the wife, hoisted that inverted [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  flag in a dispute with their liberal neighbors. Why? He doesn't say. But in the days since [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=49.32s)]
*  news of this second right wing flag broke, there has been no response from Alito, no [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=54.66s)]
*  response from the court or its chief justice, John Roberts, who now faces a growing chorus [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  of voices calling for him to appear before Congress and explain the conduct of the members [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=64.42s)]
*  of his court. That is in addition to calls for Alito at a minimum to recuse himself from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  two hugely consequential January 6 related cases sitting before the Supreme Court over [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=76.5s)]
*  his explicit and obvious violations of regulations on judicial conduct. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=83.14s)]
*  If Justice Alito does not recuse himself from the Trump immunity case in the Fisher January [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=88.9s)]
*  6 case, he will do irreparable damage to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=94.7s)]
*  He definitively needs to recuse himself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=99.34s)]
*  Well, of course, he should recuse himself from these cases. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=103.1s)]
*  At a very minimum, he has to recuse himself. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  He should recuse himself from any Trump related cases. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  Now, all this is happening on a day when the Supreme Court was open for business, handing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=113.14s)]
*  down decisions on cases it heard this spring. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=117.9s)]
*  It was possible they might even announce some action on one of those cases that people say [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=120.54s)]
*  Trump that Alito should recuse from. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=125.3s)]
*  Donald Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution for his attempts to overturn the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=127.42s)]
*  2020 election. Now, that's a case that the high court has sat on for months. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  In fact, check this out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  It has now been one hundred and sixty four days, nearly half a year since special counsel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  Jack Smith asked the justices to weigh in immediately on Trump's immunity claims, saying [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=144.42s)]
*  basically, look, I know the Supreme Court is going to want to weigh on this and the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  American voting public has a right to know the outcome of Trump's case before the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=153.62s)]
*  twenty twenty four election. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=157.38s)]
*  And the court rejected that request and they waited and they are slow walking their [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=158.62s)]
*  decision now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=164.38s)]
*  So here we are now, nearly half a year later, it's harder and harder to think that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=166.1s)]
*  someone like Sam Alito, whose household flew flags supporting the insurrection over not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=170.62s)]
*  one but two of his houses, is in any way qualified to be a person who makes judgments [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  on these cases. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=180.5s)]
*  The court did not announce a ruling today in the immunity case. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=182.94s)]
*  Who knows when and if they ever will. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=186.34s)]
*  But the six three conservative majority, the same conservative majority that destroyed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  abortion rights and dobs, the majority that now boasts multiple members who have flagrantly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=192.66s)]
*  violated basic judicial ethics, covering everything from undeclared gifts to obvious [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=197.02s)]
*  conflicts of interest, to open politicking, all of which apply to all the federal judges [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=201.54s)]
*  below the Supreme Court. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=206.26s)]
*  That majority threw open the floodgates for Republican led racial gerrymandering schemes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=207.54s)]
*  Court conservatives this time sided with a redistricting plan by South Carolina Republicans [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=213.46s)]
*  that pulled thousands of black voters out of a key battleground district. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=217.9s)]
*  In a decision that was authored by Samuel Alito, the majority agreed with those Republicans. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=222.3s)]
*  They weren't trying to disenfranchise voters of color. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=228.22s)]
*  They were trying to disenfranchise Democrats. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=231.78s)]
*  And whoopsie, most of them happen to be black. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=234.14s)]
*  See how that works? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=238.14s)]
*  It's a decision that will make it easier for Republicans to box out voters of color as [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=240.5s)]
*  long as they can argue their gerrymandering is based on political identity first and race [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=244.74s)]
*  second, a ruling that endangers the basic principle of one person, one vote. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=249.22s)]
*  Another act of right wing steamrolling that is the apotheosis of what the Trump era has [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=255.06s)]
*  wrought. We keep learning more daily about just how unaccountable they are. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=260.14s)]
*  When a justice like Samuel Alito flies this pro-insurrectionist flag, right wing flag, not [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=265.98s)]
*  once, but twice over his homes, the same flag flown by billionaire Republican donor Leonard [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=272.22s)]
*  Leo, who not only handpicked Trump's Supreme Court nominees, but also Alito and Thomas, and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=277.3s)]
*  then proceeded to give both of them hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts or at least [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=282.38s)]
*  facilitate those and trips in recent years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  They're all part of the same club. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=290.5s)]
*  I'm just a judge. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=292.06s)]
*  Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito didn't have to fly those flags to be a true conservative [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=294.3s)]
*  friend of the Trump agenda. This is what sticks with me. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=298.74s)]
*  Right. Think about this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=300.98s)]
*  I mean, Samuel Alito is one of the most powerful reactionaries in the country, arguably the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=303.06s)]
*  most. His court opinions, speeches, media appearances. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=308.98s)]
*  He could just do that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=312.82s)]
*  Why do you fly the flags? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=315.3s)]
*  They had to go an extra step and advertise. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=318.3s)]
*  Take that flag in his vacation home, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=322.1s)]
*  The signal from Alito about who he thinks he answers to. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=325.46s)]
*  He knows he's not supposed to do that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=328.38s)]
*  He knows any other judge would get in trouble. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=330.46s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=332.7s)]
*  But he thinks he answers to no one. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=334.9s)]
*  We'll see if he's right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=338.06s)]
*  The minimum that suggested disturbing readiness to keep pushing past any boundaries as the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=340.14s)]
*  movement that Alito is clearly a member of looks to destroy the current American [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=345.58s)]
*  constitutional order. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=349.94s)]
*  In the Republican primary campaign, Nikki Haley became a kind of avatar for never Trump [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=353.02s)]
*  Republicans, for the millions of people who are either still registered as Republicans or [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=357.02s)]
*  used to be and still identify at some level as such, but are fundamentally disgusted by [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=361.46s)]
*  what the party has become. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=366.7s)]
*  And it seemed clear that Haley would just end up where almost every professional Republican [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  politician ends up, which is ultimately just rolling over. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=373.26s)]
*  And yesterday, she made it official. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=377.62s)]
*  I'll be voting for the guy I told you was unstable and unhinged. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=379.65999999999997s)]
*  I will be voting for Trump. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=382.66s)]
*  Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=384.94s)]
*  Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  support me. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=399.86s)]
*  It would be smart. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  That's good advice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  Glad you're giving him advice. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=404.54s)]
*  One of the last people who had represented some sort of internal party resistance to the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=406.62s)]
*  monstrous authoritarian vision of MAGA. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  And Donald Trump is now endorsing him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=414.06s)]
*  So there's that. George Conway was once a Republican. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=415.86s)]
*  He's an attorney and a contributing writer at The Atlantic. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=419.14000000000004s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  I think the odds of this moment happening were close to 100 percent. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=423.18s)]
*  Yes. But I suppose it is definitive if there was any question about the Republican Party, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  what it is and what it means at this moment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=434.82s)]
*  It's a cult. I mean, that's the idea. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=438.3s)]
*  The only way you can describe it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=440.42s)]
*  And everyone has it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=441.82s)]
*  I mean, it consists of basically two groups of people, mostly some people who have basically [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=443.7s)]
*  completely lost it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=449.38s)]
*  The people we see in the House of Representatives. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  And then there are people who are basically afraid to call out that so many people have lost it, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=454.94s)]
*  including, you know, I mean, that's that's basically what just happened here with with with [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=459.86s)]
*  Nikki Haley and the person who has really lost it the most is Donald Trump. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=464.3s)]
*  I mean, he you know, he's the crazy one and everybody is getting more crazy than he is. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=468.26000000000005s)]
*  And as as Nikki Haley pointed out when she was telling the truth for a couple of weeks in the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=473.3s)]
*  spring, I mean, he's mentally unstable and he's getting worse. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=479.54s)]
*  And we can see it every day in the courthouse. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=482.38000000000005s)]
*  We can see it when he's standing out there complaining about the temperature, when when [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=485.26000000000005s)]
*  thermometers in the courtroom say it's 74, 75 degrees, he's saying it's freezing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=490.3s)]
*  You know, he he's you know, the lies about the election or talking about his friend, how [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=495.74s)]
*  Hannibal praising Hannibal Lecter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=500.7s)]
*  I mean, this guy, he's he is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs and he's getting as as Nikki Haley [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=502.94s)]
*  rightly pointed out, he's getting worse. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=508.74s)]
*  You put up this billboard outside. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=511.62s)]
*  Was it is it near Darrell or Mar-a-Lago? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=514.62s)]
*  It is near Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=517.46s)]
*  It is a few couple of exits south of where you if you, for example, were. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=519.1s)]
*  Yeah, at Mar-a-Lago and you happen to want to play golf at the Darrell Resort. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=525.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=529.06s)]
*  Go on to I-95, you drive south and like one or two exits on the right, you will see this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=529.3s)]
*  sign either on the way up or on the way back or both. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=535.42s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I on a lark, I decided, hey, that's a good place to put the sign. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=539.26s)]
*  I'd been making some some hats that say that like kind of like the MAGA hats, except [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=544.1s)]
*  blue and white and and some bumper stickers and and a fellow named Claude Taylor, who [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=550.02s)]
*  runs this pack called the Mag Dog Pack, has been putting up a bumper, not bumper stickers, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  but billboards, billboards. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=559.98s)]
*  And, you know, he texted me just maybe yesterday or the day before we had a few text [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=562.66s)]
*  exchanges say, hey, I'd like I'd like to know how much would it cost to put one of these up? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=567.98s)]
*  And we thought about putting it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  I thought about putting it up at the Holland tunnel or the Lincoln tunnel. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=572.54s)]
*  But it turns out he's staying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=576.5s)]
*  He's not going to Bedminster this summer. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  Some some reporters tell me because he's, you know, the campaign is going to be run out [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=580.38s)]
*  of an office near West Palm Beach Airport. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=584.46s)]
*  So this was the perfect location. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=587.02s)]
*  And I hope he sees it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=589.02s)]
*  And, you know, I hope it amuses him as much as it amuses me. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=589.98s)]
*  I think he will notice it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=594.1s)]
*  Yeah, you said yesterday we talked about this, this division between people who lost it [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  and people were afraid to speak up about that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=599.26s)]
*  You said this yesterday about the upshot of the Haley endorsement and the Alito flag [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  a lot of people have lost rights have lost their minds. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=606.18s)]
*  A lot of the people are right are afraid to say it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=608.5799999999999s)]
*  And I think that one of the things that's a little chilling [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=610.78s)]
*  about the Alito news is that he's in category one as opposed to category two. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=614.66s)]
*  Right. I mean, this is this is your circle, George. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=620.86s)]
*  These are your people, man. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=624.18s)]
*  You spent your whole career around these folks. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=625.38s)]
*  You keep insulting me like that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=627.42s)]
*  I'm going to leave. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=629.02s)]
*  But that's true. I mean, I mean, I mean, I know I can't explain it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=631.14s)]
*  I can't explain it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=635.46s)]
*  I mean, I think that I think there has been this steady deterioration [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=636.58s)]
*  in the sort of the psychological health of a good many people on the right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=641.06s)]
*  I mean, why would you? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=644.9s)]
*  I mean, I'm not. Why would you do it? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=646.06s)]
*  We're talking about why we talk about this. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=647.38s)]
*  This is the thing that I find. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=649.26s)]
*  Why would you do I find it so fascinating like I can imagine. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=650.34s)]
*  Can you imagine? Imagine, George, imagine yourself. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=653.14s)]
*  OK, 10 years ago. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=656.34s)]
*  And you're talking to a young up and coming 45 year old, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=658.02s)]
*  42 year old, like Federalist Society, really bright Supreme Court [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=662.42s)]
*  clerk, highly pedigree district court judge. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=666.42s)]
*  And they're like, I'm going to fly this flag over my house. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=669.74s)]
*  Like, obviously, your advice would be, are you out of your mind? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=673.98s)]
*  Don't do that. Why would you do that? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=677.78s)]
*  You're a federal judge. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=680.34s)]
*  Don't do you can't do it, but also don't do it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=682.38s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=684.66s)]
*  Right. No, it's it's completely I just can't fathom it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=685.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what to think about this other than [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=689.9s)]
*  it's just a horrible, horrible judgment. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=693.94s)]
*  I mean, if it's a gag, it's a horrible judgment. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=697.3000000000001s)]
*  If it means something, it's even worse. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=699.3000000000001s)]
*  I can't I can't fathom it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, luckily, judgment has nothing to do with the job that he has [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=703.42s)]
*  for the rest of his natural life. George Conway. Thank you. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bUXfVDB7gk&t=707.5s)]
