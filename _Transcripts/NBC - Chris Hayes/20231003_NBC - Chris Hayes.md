# 'He couldn't let go of it' Inside the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY)
*  The trial of Sam Bankman Fried started today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=0.0s)]
*  He, of course, the one-time crypto billionaire who became the richest person on Earth under 30 in like a matter of 18 months. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=2.6s)]
*  He was also one of the biggest donors in Democratic politics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  And he basically had the whole world at his feet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=13.4s)]
*  President Bill Clinton was on stage with him at a crypto conference. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=16.4s)]
*  He got athletes like Tom Brady and Steph Curry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=19.8s)]
*  And remember comedians like Larry David remember to cut that commercial in the Super Bowl for his crypto exchange FTX. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And then the thing went bust, just completely bust. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=29.2s)]
*  And Sam Bankman Fried was subsequently indicted for conspiracy and fraud by federal prosecutors. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=32.0s)]
*  If he is convicted, he could face over a hundred years in prison. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=37.4s)]
*  And it's one of the most spectacular rise and fall stories of basically anyone in recent memory. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=41.0s)]
*  And as it turns out, bestselling nonfiction author Michael Lewis was basically just hanging out with Bankman Fried on his way up and the way down. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  His new book about it, Going Infinite, was published today and joining me now, Michael Lewis, in his first live TV interview about this book. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=56.0s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=62.3s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=63.2s)]
*  It's an incredible read, as all Michael Lewis works are. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=63.8s)]
*  Before I get into this, let me ask you this question. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=67.0s)]
*  As someone who's written about finance from Liar's Poker, your first incredible claim book. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=68.9s)]
*  When I tried to get my head around crypto and kept having this thing of like, is this a con or is it not? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=74.0s)]
*  And I kept going back and forth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=80.4s)]
*  Is it a con? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=81.6s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=82.0s)]
*  I talked to some people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=82.2s)]
*  In the end, I kind of was like, didn't quite come down. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=83.7s)]
*  And then all this blew up and I was like, guess it was a con. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=88.5s)]
*  Where is your, I mean, independent of him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=89.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=91.8s)]
*  Like this thing that created billions of dollars that was sloshing around the con, trillions of dollars sloshing around the economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Where do you think of it in that trajectory? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=99.2s)]
*  So it's odd because it's kind of both. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=101.9s)]
*  I mean, I think in the first place, it's a tulip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=103.7s)]
*  I mean, what we've been through is like a tulip craze. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  But the technology underneath it, it's real. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Like it actually has promised to do things like get rid of financial intermediaries. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=112.7s)]
*  It's not, it's not nothing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=117.4s)]
*  It's maybe overblown. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=120.0s)]
*  And the thing that's kind of been odd about it as a story, you know, it's a created in 2008 from 2008 on it's it's had a series of sort of narratives. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=121.8s)]
*  It has tried to sell it, but none of the narratives are been have been true. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=130.9s)]
*  It's sort of like it's this solution in search of a problem. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=135.2s)]
*  That's what it feels. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=138.1s)]
*  And it's a real thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=138.9s)]
*  There's real tech there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=140.6s)]
*  It's like when the tulip, you know, there's famous Dutch tulip craze. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=141.4s)]
*  People are or beanie babies, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=144.8s)]
*  Like when it got real hot and frothy in the market when this guy's worth 30 billion, it felt like that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=147.0s)]
*  Yes, it did. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=152.0s)]
*  But but it so it hasn't it's it's promise has not been realized. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=152.8s)]
*  It's not to say it's just nothing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=157.3s)]
*  It's like it does it could one day in the future would not be shocking if blockchain is used in all of financial transactions, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=159.1s)]
*  Just hasn't happened yet. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=167.5s)]
*  And so in between there are lots of stories that have gotten told are kind of not true stories and it's fueled this craze. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  And and to me the crypto itself wasn't that it wasn't what was interesting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  It was the social consequences of three trillion dollars being created out of nothing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=177.1s)]
*  That really was I mean, it was so striking if you were even adjacent or even a few nodes away from it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=181.5s)]
*  All of a sudden this money is just cascading out of this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  And he got a big chunk of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  So this guy, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=191.1s)]
*  This it's a facet. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=193.6s)]
*  Look, he's a strange dude. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=196.6s)]
*  I mean in the end, it's like again, there's sort of this like Bernie Madoff style con man like benighted strange dude over his head. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=197.2s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I ended up in I had come down in the Bernie Madoff category, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=206.6s)]
*  When I read the indictment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's not really the line. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=215.0s)]
*  This book takes what are your impression of well, so just for starters, I mean this like I think this is important distinction. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Everybody shouts at me when I make it but Bernie Madoff. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=224.3s)]
*  It was a Ponzi scheme and is like a definition of a Ponzi. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=227.0s)]
*  There's no real business there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=230.9s)]
*  So Sam Bankman Fried had two businesses. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=231.4s)]
*  He had this hedge fund. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  He called Alameda research, but he had this crypto exchange and the exchange was a gold mine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  It generated a billion dollars in revenues in 2021 like 400 million dollars in profits. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=240.4s)]
*  It was real without without the hedge fund there to screw it up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=244.5s)]
*  It still be there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=249.8s)]
*  You know, he it was a casino. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  It was just like they took little slices of every transaction in in in crypto. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=252.2s)]
*  So and the other one is still around right coinbase or whatever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=256.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, there are a bunch of them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=259.3s)]
*  They're still around. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=260.3s)]
*  So and people most of them the most money in crypto has been made by people who bought Bitcoin when it was zero or people who created these exchanges. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=260.9s)]
*  So there was this real thing and the the alleged crime kind of makes no sense. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=268.7s)]
*  He blew up 40 billion dollar a 40 billion dollar business for this kind of hedge fund on the side. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=274.8s)]
*  It really was it was his legacy business is how he got into crypto in the first place, but it didn't they didn't bear a necessary relationship. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=280.8s)]
*  There was a relationship but wasn't necessary. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=289.0s)]
*  He could have gotten rid of that thing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  But he did seem to take people's money in one and transfer it over to the other. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=292.4s)]
*  And he did and he was you know, I think of him as a creature of modern finance. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=296.2s)]
*  I mean in any other era on Wall Street, he's probably not on Wall Street, but he's pulled out of MIT by high frequency trading firms that identify his mind. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  Yes, is exactly the kind of mind that belongs in finance and you know, almost any other period in history. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=309.6s)]
*  He's like a high school physics teacher here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=315.70000000000005s)]
*  He's he's he's kind of imprinted by this good point and it's sort of like he gets he becomes his identity this trading thing and and I think he couldn't let go of it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=317.8s)]
*  You know, I saw some there was some Elon Musk in obviously, you know, Walter Eisen has his Elon Musk biography, but just like you do the compare and contrast. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=329.2s)]
*  They're different though. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=337.4s)]
*  Well, they are different, but there's something about a certain kind of mind that that works like a key in a lock of a certain kind of set of problem solving. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=338.2s)]
*  Yeah, but is not great outside of that domain. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=347.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=350.7s)]
*  And maybe to disastrous consequence. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=352.0s)]
*  So Sam Bankman free set. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=354.0s)]
*  He said until I hit Wall Street. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=355.4s)]
*  I didn't think that was really special at anything. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=358.4s)]
*  I wasn't good at anything. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=361.0s)]
*  There wasn't anything I was suited for. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=362.4s)]
*  He hits he hits Jane Street of this high frequency chain for me says this is what I was put on Earth to do and then what he did is he saw that in crypto. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  There's an even bigger opportunity to do it than in stocks and bonds and currencies. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=370.7s)]
*  So that that's what gets him going in the first place. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  So but it is so you're you're watching something that like it only happened now and this phenomenal. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=377.5s)]
*  Someone becoming that rich that quickly and the way the whole society shapes itself around him politics media. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=383.6s)]
*  There are there are scenes in here of what that looks like the clustering around when that much money comes in one person that quickly that are like truly gobsmacking. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  It's called going infinite. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  It's on sale today. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=402.0s)]
*  Michael Lewis. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=403.0s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0E5A8LELBY&t=403.5s)]
