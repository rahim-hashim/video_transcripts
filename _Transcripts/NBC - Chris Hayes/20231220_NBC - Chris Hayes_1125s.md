# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY)
*  As we await multiple Supreme Court rulings on both Donald Trump's future, both as presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=0.0s)]
*  candidate and a free man, and also the future of American democracy, the Court finds itself [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=6.12s)]
*  mired in a serious legitimacy crisis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=11.92s)]
*  Its conservative members are in an almost seemingly endless and shocking succession [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=15.22s)]
*  of ethical scandals, something we have covered extensively on this show, particularly when [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=19.52s)]
*  it comes to the most egregious offender, Clarence Thomas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  While there have been other controversies, particularly around conservative Justice Samuel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=27.4s)]
*  Alito, Thomas seems to be in a category of his own. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=30.52s)]
*  He has spent decades on the receiving end of the sustained and often undisclosed largesse [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=34.82s)]
*  of a number of right-wing billionaire benefactors who have crafted for him a life of high luxury [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=40.68s)]
*  on the salary of a Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=45.8s)]
*  Thomas' wife have received free vacations on yachts and travel on private jets. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=49.0s)]
*  His high-end RV was essentially purchased for him, the man he raised as his son had [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=53.4s)]
*  his private school tuition paid for as a student. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  His mother lives rent-free, all thanks to handouts from the conservative movement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=62.28s)]
*  We should note that Supreme Court justices make well over the national median income, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=68.72s)]
*  currently a little over $285,000 a year. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=72.28s)]
*  They're not going poor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=75.48s)]
*  But they do not make what we on the show like to call third boat money, let alone tropical [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  vacation on our private luxury yacht money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=82.6s)]
*  So when these stories first started breaking from ProPublica, it seemed that rich conservatives [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=85.74s)]
*  were trying to placate Thomas into staying on the court and locking in their right-wing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=90.72s)]
*  majority by supplementing his income with the trappings of extraordinary wealth, with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  the added benefit that, hey, if you ever have actual business before the court in some facet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  or another, it can't hurt to own the house of one of the justice's moms. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=103.32s)]
*  Now it's a well-documented fact that Clarence Thomas was born into a poor family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=107.96s)]
*  He did not marry into wealth and, in fact, spent much of his life deeply in debt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=112.38s)]
*  He had a desire to live at a level beyond his government salary means. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  So it really looked from afar, as I read all this reporting and we followed you here on [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=121.46s)]
*  the show, like essentially some kind of arrangement, I would guess implicit or tacit, had been [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=125.5s)]
*  worked out through these billionaire benefactors. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  Thomas could stay on the court instead of jumping ship to a fancy corporate law firm [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=132.3s)]
*  for big payday and still live a life of enormous luxury with private vacations and a fancy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=135.82s)]
*  RV that he loves to drive around the country and cosplay as an average Joe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  Do you find this? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  It's away from the sort of the meanness that you see in Washington. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  You get here with just the regular folks and it's so pleasant. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  Oh, the regular folks in my incredibly luxe expensive RV. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, all this stuff put together for Thomas is almost like a benefits package. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  The man could functionally operate with two sources of income and two sets of institutions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=169.5s)]
*  he works for. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=174.5s)]
*  The United States government that pays him his official salary, the people of the United [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=175.5s)]
*  States, and then the right wing movement that subsidizes the rest of his life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=179.5s)]
*  And now we finally have evidence that not only is this theory true and this arrangement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=183.5s)]
*  is what it appeared to be, but that Thomas came about as close as you could possibly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=187.5s)]
*  come to explicitly asking for it hat in hand. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=193.5s)]
*  According to a new report in ProPublica back in 2000, Thomas started loudly complaining [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=198.54s)]
*  about his financial situation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=203.54s)]
*  He was making about one hundred seventy four thousand dollars a year, which is equal to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=204.54s)]
*  about three hundred thousand today's money. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=208.54s)]
*  But he was, as he said, hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=210.54s)]
*  When Thomas found himself sitting next to a then Republican member of Congress on a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=213.54s)]
*  flight, he reportedly told them that if the justices did not get a pay raise, quote, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=218.54s)]
*  one or more justices will leave soon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=222.54s)]
*  Not a very subtle message, I got to say. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  It sounds a lot like give me more money or I'm going to quit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  And remember, this is 2000, OK? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  Bill Clinton was in the White House, Republicans controlled the Senate, but there's a real [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  risk if Thomas retired, his seat would go to a liberal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  And Thomas is also the sort of intellectual core of the right wing of the court. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  And it sure seems like that message was received loud and clear. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  That threat from Thomas was written up in a memo for then Chief Justice William Wenquist [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  and while Thomas did not receive the significant pay raise he wanted from Congress, the message [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=253.62s)]
*  got out to the conservative movement who made sure he was taken care of. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=258.62s)]
*  As ProPublica reports, quote, during his second decade in the court, Thomas's financial [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=261.62s)]
*  situation appears to have markedly improved. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=265.62s)]
*  Thomas received dozens of expensive gifts throughout the 2000s, sometimes coming from [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=268.62s)]
*  people he'd met only shortly before. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=272.62s)]
*  What followed was years of largesse from rich and well-connected conservatives, the second [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=275.62s)]
*  set of income. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=279.62s)]
*  And by 2019, Thomas no longer sounded like the guy complaining to anyone who would listen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=280.66s)]
*  and he was not happy with his salary. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=284.66s)]
*  Right now, what is the compensation of a justice of the Supreme Court? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=286.66s)]
*  Oh, goodness, I think it's plenty. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=291.66s)]
*  This is fine. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=296.66s)]
*  I have no, my wife and I are doing fine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=298.66s)]
*  We don't, we don't live extravagantly, but we are fine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=301.66s)]
*  So here we are, nearly a quarter of a century after Thomas retired, the second set of income [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=305.66s)]
*  nearly a quarter of a century after Thomas essentially threatened to quit. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  He's become one of the most consequential right wing justices of his era, who has [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  built a national conservative judicial movement that adheres to his ideological philosophy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  and that of his billionaire benefactors. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  And he is one of nine who will decide if the man who attempted the coup will get a bailout [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  or if he will be brought to justice. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  They've stayed this knowing the Supreme Court is going to get involved. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  And we know the Supreme Court has been imperious in what it thinks it is its business to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=333.74s)]
*  weigh in on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=339.74s)]
*  What what do you what's your first thought about this heading headed to the Toscotas? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=341.74s)]
*  Why do you think the conservatives would overturn Colorado? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=346.74s)]
*  I mean, whoo, states rats, brother. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=349.74s)]
*  Isn't that what the conservatives usually look? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=352.74s)]
*  Of course, the Supreme Court is going to weigh in and likely overturn the Colorado State [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=354.74s)]
*  Supreme Court's interpretation of Colorado state law because the conservatives on the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  Supreme Court, who usually go on and on and on about states rights, are hypocrites and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  they are comfortable being hypocrites and they will be hypocritical in this situation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  And they will overturn Colorado's own state court process. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  But they shouldn't. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  And when you're talking about writing this decision and what it must be like for the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  state court judge, I would like to point out that they were so aware of what Scodas was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=386.82s)]
*  about to do in terms of running over backwards that they literally quote Neil Gorsuch, Neil [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=391.82s)]
*  Gorsuch when he was sitting on the federal circuit in Colorado. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=398.82s)]
*  They quote Gorsuch for the opinion that Colorado gets to the side, its own rules about who [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=401.82s)]
*  is qualified or not for the ballot in Colorado. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=408.82s)]
*  That's a Gorsuch opinion that they quote in the thing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=412.82s)]
*  So if Gorsuch had any logical consistency, he would likely uphold the Colorado State [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=415.86s)]
*  Court opinion. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=420.86s)]
*  But what we're about to see is just how, again, hypocritical and unserious the Supreme Court [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=421.86s)]
*  is when it comes to protecting their partisan sugar daddies like Donald Trump. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=428.86s)]
*  Yeah, let me read from that because we only saw this because of you pointing it out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=433.86s)]
*  So credit where due. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=437.86s)]
*  They do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=438.86s)]
*  They send this up to, you know, they know that Justice Gorsuch will almost certainly [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=439.86s)]
*  weigh on this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  They say, as then Judge Gorsuch recognized in Hassan, this is the case they're citing, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  it is a state's legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  the political process that, quote, permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  Judge Cordell, you imagine you have the same interpretation that this is not an accident [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  to quote then Judge Gorsuch to possible Justice Gorsuch in possible Supreme Court review. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=468.94s)]
*  Yeah, these justices know who their audience is. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=477.94s)]
*  And their audience is the Supreme Court. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=480.94s)]
*  They know this is headed that way. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=482.94s)]
*  And I will tell you, Chris, quite frankly, there should only be eight justices on the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=484.94s)]
*  Supreme Court hearing this case when it comes up. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=488.94s)]
*  And I say that because Clarence Thomas has no business hearing this case. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=491.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=496.94s)]
*  Because his wife was a major player in the whole insurrection. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=497.98s)]
*  And he should, he should, if he had principles, recuse himself. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=502.98s)]
*  But I will guarantee you this, Clarence Thomas will recuse himself when Ginny flies. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=508.98s)]
*  I think as war in Gaza enters its third month, it has become more and more difficult to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=514.98s)]
*  properly communicate the scale and depth of misery and destruction it has visited upon [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=522.02s)]
*  the people of Gaza. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=528.02s)]
*  Over the past week, there have been three incidents that I think illustrate just how [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=530.02s)]
*  indefensible Israel's current campaign is on moral, strategic and political grounds. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=535.02s)]
*  First, of course, is the horrifying news of the death of three Israeli hostages shot and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=541.02s)]
*  killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=546.02s)]
*  Now, to be absolutely clear, the blood of those men is on the hands of Hamas, which [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=549.06s)]
*  committed a war crime by kidnapping them and putting them in danger. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=553.06s)]
*  Alongside rage at Hamas for their deaths, the deaths have understandably also occasioned [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=557.06s)]
*  profound sadness and anger at the government in Israel. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=562.06s)]
*  After all, the only thing that has actually delivered safety to a large number of hostages [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=565.06s)]
*  has been the week-long cessation of hostilities in November and extended diplomacy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=570.06s)]
*  Families of the hostages have long warned that the war itself risked killing their loved [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  ones and now that very eventuality they warned of has come to pass. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=580.0999999999999s)]
*  Adding to the sense of betrayal are the circumstances of how these three hostages died. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=585.0999999999999s)]
*  According to the Israeli government itself, they were shirtless. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=590.0999999999999s)]
*  One was carrying a white flag, makeshift, when they were shot and killed by Israeli [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  troops. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=599.0999999999999s)]
*  I want you to think to yourselves for a moment, why were three shirtless men waving a white [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=600.14s)]
*  flag shot by soldiers? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=605.14s)]
*  And was this the first time such a thing has happened in this conflict? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=609.14s)]
*  Have Palestinian civilians been shot and killed in similar circumstances? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=612.14s)]
*  Which brings us to the second incident. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=617.14s)]
*  Over the weekend, two Palestinian women, a mother and a daughter, who along with other [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=619.14s)]
*  Christian Palestinians had taken shelter in a Catholic church in Gaza City, were shot [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=622.14s)]
*  and killed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=627.14s)]
*  The Pope himself condemned the killings. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=628.18s)]
*  The Jerusalem Patriarch of the Catholic Church said the women were murdered in cold blood [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=631.18s)]
*  by Israeli snipers as they walked to a convent in the compound. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=636.18s)]
*  A point echoed this week by the Archbishop of Westminster in London. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=640.18s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a cold-blooded killing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=645.18s)]
*  That's the description that is given. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=649.18s)]
*  And what absolutely puzzles me is this does nothing to further Israel's right to defend [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=653.2199999999999s)]
*  itself, which I understand. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=662.2199999999999s)]
*  Israeli officials initially denied those reports, said they do not target civilians, no matter [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=664.2199999999999s)]
*  their religion. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=669.2199999999999s)]
*  They now say they do not know what happened. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=670.2199999999999s)]
*  We also don't definitively know what happened, in large part because Gaza is the most dangerous [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=673.2199999999999s)]
*  place in the world for journalists. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=679.2199999999999s)]
*  And that brings us to the third incident. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=681.26s)]
*  On Friday, the legendary Gaza bureau chief for Al Jazeera, Wael Al Daudud, was wounded [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=683.26s)]
*  and his cameraman, Samer Abu Dhaka, was killed as they covered the aftermath of an Israeli [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=689.26s)]
*  strike on a UN school that had been converted into a shelter. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=695.26s)]
*  Now you may remember Wael Al Daudud lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson all [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=698.26s)]
*  in an Israeli airstrike already in October. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=705.26s)]
*  And Samer was a good friend and colleague of my friend and colleague, Eamon Mohaldeen. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=708.3s)]
*  They worked together in Gaza. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=712.3s)]
*  Both those men risked their lives, like all journalists in Gaza, to do their job. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=715.3s)]
*  The Israeli military said it has never and will never deliberately target journalists, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=720.3s)]
*  that it takes operationally feasible measures to protect civilians and journalists. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=724.3s)]
*  Now there are two possibilities here. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=728.3s)]
*  Either the Israeli military is intentionally targeting journalists to kill them and lying [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=730.3s)]
*  about them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=735.3s)]
*  Or its methods of war making are so indiscriminate, in the words of Joe Biden, that more journalists [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  have been killed in two months of this conflict than American reporters killed in 20 years [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=741.3399999999999s)]
*  in Vietnam. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 68 journalists have died so far. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=747.3399999999999s)]
*  And I will tell you, I'm actually inclined to believe it's the latter, because there [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=753.3399999999999s)]
*  are dozens, if not hundreds of first-person eyewitness accounts of deaths as wrenching [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=756.3399999999999s)]
*  and outrageous as the deaths of the people who died in the war. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=761.3399999999999s)]
*  And again, amidst the fog of war and the dangers for reporters, it is simply impossible to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=764.38s)]
*  independently confirm that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=769.38s)]
*  And we need to be very careful what we can and cannot definitively say happened in each [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=770.38s)]
*  instance. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=775.38s)]
*  What we know for sure, though, is that the destruction of Gaza is nearly total. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=776.38s)]
*  The vast majority of its 2.2 million residents displaced. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=782.38s)]
*  Half are at risk of starvation. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=786.38s)]
*  Nearly all hostages are at risk of being killed. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=788.38s)]
*  Half are at risk of starvation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=791.42s)]
*  Nearly all hospitals destroyed. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=793.42s)]
*  Only four are functioning, according to the UN. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=795.42s)]
*  We don't know for sure how many deaths, but there are tens of thousands, most likely, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=798.42s)]
*  with many bodies still trapped beneath the rubble. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=804.42s)]
*  A fifth of Gaza's buildings are estimated to have been destroyed. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=807.42s)]
*  In the north Gaza, more than 60% of the buildings have been severely damaged, according to analysis [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=811.42s)]
*  of satellite radar data. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=816.42s)]
*  A U.S. intelligence assessment found that half of the bombs dropped were, quote, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=818.4599999999999s)]
*  dumb bombs. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=822.4599999999999s)]
*  That is, not targeted, but rather enormous explosives that blow up everything around them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  No wonder, then, that the excellent veteran war correspondent Clarissa Ward [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=828.4599999999999s)]
*  entered Gaza with an Emirati medical team. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=833.4599999999999s)]
*  When she did that, she compared the ruins she saw with her own eyes [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=835.4599999999999s)]
*  to other devastating war zones in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=839.4599999999999s)]
*  A man and a 13-year-old boy are wheeled in, both missing limbs, both in a perilous state. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=843.5s)]
*  Since the field hospital opened less than two weeks ago, it has been inundated with patients. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=853.5s)]
*  130 of their 150 beds are already full. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=859.5s)]
*  Like Grozny, Aleppo, and Mariupol, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=865.5s)]
*  Gaza will go down as one of the great horrors of modern warfare. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=868.54s)]
*  The Israeli government says the ultimate responsibility for this destruction lies with Hamas [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=873.54s)]
*  because it hides within the civilian population of Gaza. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=878.54s)]
*  And there's one level at which this is true and not even really in dispute. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=881.54s)]
*  I mean, Hamas is interwoven with and embedded in a dense civilian population. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=885.54s)]
*  Hamas doesn't have some huge area marked as Hamas military base set far away from apartment complexes [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=889.54s)]
*  that Israel can attack with no worry about civilians. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=895.5799999999999s)]
*  There's two problems with this justification though. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=899.5799999999999s)]
*  One, international humanitarian law is clear there is no category of human shield. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=901.5799999999999s)]
*  For example, if a number of terrorists are holed up in an elementary school with a bunch of children, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=906.5799999999999s)]
*  you can't simply bomb the school and blame the terrorists for the children's death. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=911.5799999999999s)]
*  But that aside, the deeper problem here is that if you spend any time at all [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=915.5799999999999s)]
*  reading the Israeli press, listening to what Israeli leaders and commentators are actually saying, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=921.62s)]
*  it is very clear that for a lot of people in government, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=926.62s)]
*  the mass destruction of Gaza, raising it like Putin raised Grozny or Assad raised Aleppo, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=930.62s)]
*  is the point, the goal. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=935.62s)]
*  Many prominent members of the Israeli governing class don't think there is such a thing as an innocent civilian in Gaza. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=938.62s)]
*  Have said that everyone in Gaza deserves their fate. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=945.62s)]
*  From Knesset member Marev Ben-Ari saying that, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=948.66s)]
*  quote, the children of Gaza have brought this upon themselves. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=951.66s)]
*  To an Israeli military spokesman saying the emphasis of Israel's military campaign was, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=955.66s)]
*  quote, on damage and not on accuracy. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=959.66s)]
*  To Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=962.66s)]
*  suggesting there are no civilians in Gaza and everyone is a legitimate target. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=964.66s)]
*  To journalist Shimon Ricklin who said this on Israeli TV. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=968.66s)]
*  I know, I'll say it here, I don't care if they shoot me, they're adding stuff here. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=978.66s)]
*  I'm not a good person without seeing houses rotting in Gaza. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=982.66s)]
*  What am I going to do? More, more, more houses, more buildings, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=985.66s)]
*  that they won't have anywhere to go. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=990.66s)]
*  That's not a finished view in Israel. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=993.66s)]
*  I mean, even the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=995.66s)]
*  invoked the lessons from the biblical story of Amalek [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=998.66s)]
*  in addressing the nation in Hebrew in the end of October. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1001.66s)]
*  And in that biblical chapter, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  God commands King Saul on how to respond to an attack [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  by the rival kingdom of Amalek. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1010.6999999999999s)]
*  Quote, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1012.6999999999999s)]
*  Now go attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1013.6999999999999s)]
*  Do not spare them. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1017.6999999999999s)]
*  Put them to death men and women, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1019.6999999999999s)]
*  children and infants, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  cattle and sheep, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1022.6999999999999s)]
*  camels and donkeys. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1023.6999999999999s)]
*  Now I will be the first to confess, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1025.7s)]
*  the first to confess I have no idea what to do about Hamas [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1027.7s)]
*  or about what comes next. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1030.7s)]
*  But the Amalek method cannot be the solution. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1032.74s)]
*  To be honest, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1037.74s)]
*  I'm not particularly convinced the Israeli leadership [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1038.74s)]
*  has any idea what will come next. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1040.74s)]
*  Many want full destruction. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1042.74s)]
*  And Hamas also wants this war. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1044.74s)]
*  They have been clear on that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1046.74s)]
*  I think they want it to continue. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1047.74s)]
*  They seem to think all of this death and destruction benefits in the end [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1048.74s)]
*  because of the rage it will produce towards Israel. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1052.74s)]
*  But whatever your views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1055.74s)]
*  it is just plainly the case [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1059.78s)]
*  that our country is supporting a war [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1061.78s)]
*  whose animating moral logic looks to most of the world [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1063.78s)]
*  and frankly to me [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1066.78s)]
*  to be that every single last person in Gaza [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1068.78s)]
*  is guilty and deserves their lot. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1071.78s)]
*  And that is the moral logic of Hamas. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1074.78s)]
*  It is the moral logic that drove the atrocity of October 7th. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1077.78s)]
*  And an atrocity like October 7th does not, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1081.78s)]
*  cannot justify whatever comes after it, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1084.78s)]
*  whatever the response. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1087.78s)]
*  There is no terrorist attack, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1088.82s)]
*  no matter how horrific, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1089.82s)]
*  and truly October 7th was horrific, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1090.82s)]
*  that can wash clean what we are seeing in Gaza [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1093.82s)]
*  and what we as Americans and our government are abetting. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1096.82s)]
*  It must end. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1100.82s)]
*  We must stop it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1102.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCV7ICCXLtY&t=1118.78s)]
