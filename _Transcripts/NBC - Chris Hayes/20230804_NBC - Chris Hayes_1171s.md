# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, as you've seen, they caught him. They [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=0.0s)]
*  got him. They finally got the guy. After over two and a half years, the man responsible [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=5.28s)]
*  for the attempted January 6th coup was taken into federal custody in Washington, D.C. And [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=10.36s)]
*  of course, we've known all along just who the prime suspect was, who we should be on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=15.92s)]
*  the lookout for. We did it in front of everybody. But today he was nabbed, so to speak. He was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=22.2s)]
*  arrested and booked. No mugshot was taken. The ex president, but his fingerprints were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=29.64s)]
*  taken. There are no cameras allowed in federal court. But we have these sketches where Donald [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=34.64s)]
*  J. Trump, the 44th president of the United States, was arraigned, 45th president of the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=40.56s)]
*  United States, was arraigned on four felony counts for his attempts to steal the election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=46.04s)]
*  The ex president pleaded not guilty. There were no literal handcuffs, but he surrendered [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  He submitted to federal custody in the federal courthouse. Special counsel Jack Smith sat [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=57.84s)]
*  in the front row during the arraignment. Defended Trump was sworn in. We did not hear a lot [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  from him, but when asked by the magistrate judge, he stated his full name, quote, Donald [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=67.88000000000001s)]
*  J. Trump. John, when asked his age, he said, quote, 7777. He entered his plea of not guilty [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=71.64s)]
*  on all charges for his attempts to subvert American democracy and to end the constitutional [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=80.12s)]
*  republic as we know it. In an extraordinary and unexpected turn, the magistrate judge [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=85.76s)]
*  warned the defendant, Donald, John Trump, to not try to influence any jurors. She warned [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  the defendant not to commit any crimes while he is out on release, that he would be held [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=100.68s)]
*  by the federal government should he do so. He was then released on the condition that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=107.92s)]
*  he not communicate any facts of the case with witnesses unless in the presence of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=112.92s)]
*  counsel. The judge warned the ex president would be detained if he violated the conditions [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=117.2s)]
*  of his release. And now Trump faces a total of 78 felony counts in his three upcoming [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=121.88s)]
*  criminal trials. But none of those 78 counts are like these four. This is the big one, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=128.28s)]
*  the biggest of all time. And, you know, I want to take a step back for just a moment [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=136.52s)]
*  and make note of how we got here. Because one of the craziest things about January [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=141.0s)]
*  6th, and if you take yourself back to that day and you think about it in real time, it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=145.4s)]
*  was truly wild, was that when it was all over, this surreal, upsetting scene playing out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  in real time on live television, everyone just went home. Do you remember that? Like, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=155.88s)]
*  no one got arrested on the spot. Despite the fact that rioters nearly destroyed the nation's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=162.68s)]
*  capital, they smashed windows, they ransacked congressional offices, defecated inside them, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=167.96s)]
*  including the office of the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, which they ransacked. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=173.12s)]
*  They overtook the floor of the Senate. They temporarily blocked the certification of votes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  They brutally attacked police officers with flagpoles and bats and crushes and bear spray, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=181.28s)]
*  chunks of wood. Blood was spilled. They chanted, hang Mike Pence as they hunted him down in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  the halls of Congress. And then after all of that, after we watched it all, no one got [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=195.76s)]
*  arrested. We saw them commit the crimes. We saw the crimes committed in real time, the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=201.44s)]
*  violence unfolding before our eyes. We watched as the violent rioters just went home. Police [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=208.12s)]
*  just walked them out. And their leader, the man who sent them there, the man they stormed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=216.04s)]
*  the Capitol for, the man who told them to go down to the Capitol. He had this final message for them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=221.12s)]
*  But go home. I love you. You did everything right. Totally justified. Go home. Really? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=251.12s)]
*  No one? No handcuffs? No one's going to get arrested after that? After an attempted coup [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=261.08s)]
*  with violence and bloodshed? Everyone just go home. Good night. You know, America's not [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=266.92s)]
*  the only country on earth. Sometimes we forget that here. And when this happens in other [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=273.52s)]
*  countries, plays out differently. Let's take a comparison. Brazil, earlier this year, Brazil's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=277.44s)]
*  president Jair Bolsonaro and his followers tried to hold onto power following an election [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=282.4s)]
*  defeat. Brazil had their own January 6th, their own attempted coup. It happened on January [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=286.32s)]
*  8th of this year with Bolsonaro supporters storming the Capitol in Brasilia, claiming [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=292.2s)]
*  there was fraud and the election was stolen. In fact, their coup seemed almost explicitly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=298.56s)]
*  modeled on ours, like a weird kind of American export. There was one enormous difference. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=303.08s)]
*  At the end of that coup, when it failed, all of those rioters got marched out by security [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=310.28s)]
*  forces in zip ties on the very same day. Hundreds arrested on the spot. Get on the bus, boys. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  Right there. Typically, when you see coup attempts happen in other countries and they [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=327.72s)]
*  don't work, it looks more like that. It's not a go home and chill kind of situation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=333.72s)]
*  Here in the U.S., a different story. And over the last two and a half years, the Department [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=341.8s)]
*  of Justice, to their credit, launched the largest investigation in its history to try [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  to find the January 6th rioters. They worked from the bottom up. Over 1,000 people have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  been charged. Nearly 600 have pleaded guilty. Nearly 100 have been found guilty at trial. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=355.08s)]
*  And the investigation continues to this day. Just yesterday, this guy on your screen, a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=360.8s)]
*  member of the violent January 6th mob, was finally arrested. Why does he look like that? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, he is a St. Louis Cardinals super fan known as Rally Runner. Yesterday, Rally Runner [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=370.08s)]
*  finally got hauled in. Today, ahead of the attempted coup, the guy the mob stormed the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=376.44s)]
*  Capitol for, the guy who told them that he loved them, well, he finally got his day in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=382.92s)]
*  court. He pleaded not guilty to the sprawling conspiracy to hold on to power. The prosecutors [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=387.76s)]
*  lay out an incredible detail. The arraignment today was described by people inside the room [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=393.8s)]
*  as intense, packed capacity, several other federal judges, in fact, and the chief judge [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=399.12s)]
*  of the D.C. federal court seated in the back row taking it all in. The parties decided [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  on the next hearing date. The magistrate judge gave three options after conferring with the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=409.24s)]
*  trial judge, Judge Chutkin. Jack Smith's team, guess, guess, oh yes, they picked the earliest [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=413.36s)]
*  date. And guess what Trump's team did? They requested the latest date and they got it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=419.56s)]
*  They ultimately agreed. August 28th at 10 a.m. and the judge will set a trial date then. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=424.04s)]
*  Get ready. Jen Psaki is the former White House press secretary for President Biden, is the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=431.76s)]
*  host of Inside with Jen Psaki on MSNBC. Michael Beschloss is an NBC News presidential historian, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=438.28s)]
*  and both of them join me now. Jen, first, I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you today as [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=444.52s)]
*  you're watching it. I'm curious your reaction to today. You know, the bureau here is just a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=450.4s)]
*  few blocks. I mean, I could walk to where the courthouse is, to where Garrett is. It's raining, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  but I could still walk there. And I think there was this expectation that it would be a circus, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=462.28s)]
*  or I had that expectation. It really wasn't outside of the courthouse, a circus. And that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=467.2s)]
*  speaks to how much things have changed in some ways over the last couple of years for the good, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=473.2s)]
*  in part, I think, because of the efforts by the Department of Justice to go after the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=478.0s)]
*  oath keepers and disincentivize this type of gathering. But the other thing that struck me, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=482.64s)]
*  Chris, is that as much as we didn't see in the courtroom, and as you noted in your opening, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  there were a lot of developments that came out of it that I think were surprising. I mean, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=492.0s)]
*  Trump was treated like a teenager in some ways, not a 77-year-old former president, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=495.36s)]
*  but also that just listening to it, he seemed smaller in some ways to me. I mean, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=501.24s)]
*  he didn't do a big campaign event. He did have some remarks. He didn't go to a public event. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=507.48s)]
*  He didn't give a long speech. You know, that was striking to me as well. But also, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=512.28s)]
*  we're going to learn more in a couple of weeks when the judge, who clearly means business, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=517.6s)]
*  moves forward on getting us a trial date. That point on seeming smaller, I just want to add [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=521.76s)]
*  something to that because of talking with some of our colleagues here after the special coverage. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=527.68s)]
*  And it's notable that he's alone. There's no posse, and there's no retinue, and there's no [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=531.6s)]
*  family. I would hope if I were to go through the ordeal that this man is currently facing, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=536.92s)]
*  in my darkest hours, having to go, my wife and my kids and my loved ones and my friends, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=545.0s)]
*  that I would have a crew, people that are standing. His wife is not there. I can't see [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=550.4s)]
*  any of his kids, his daughter. No one. The guy's alone. He is solo, rolling with the lawyers that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=553.92s)]
*  are willing to take and hope his checks clear. And that is really striking Michael Beschloss on a day [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=560.48s)]
*  that is a huge day, right? No matter how much I think he wants to say it isn't, and this is a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=565.76s)]
*  witch hunt, yada yada. I don't think there's any real analog in American history for what happened [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=571.84s)]
*  today. Nothing remotely like it, Chris. And Chris, you and Jen and I, we all have children. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=578.16s)]
*  Yours are, two of you guys, yours are younger than mine are, but I guarantee you that they will learn [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=585.68s)]
*  about what happened this day. And not only because it's the first time an ex-president was indicted [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  for offenses that he committed in office, but look at the consequence. Just as you were saying at the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=598.16s)]
*  beginning, Chris, if this had succeeded, let's say some of those attackers in the Capitol had [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=603.2s)]
*  been about five or 10 minutes faster and gotten to Nancy Pelosi or got to Mike Pence or others. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  Some of them had murder and kidnapping in their heart. Or let's say this trial got further delayed [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=615.6s)]
*  and didn't take place before the 2024 election and Donald Trump becomes president next year [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=622.88s)]
*  and he wants to finish the job that he did not finish on the 6th of January with some kind of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=629.36s)]
*  presidential dictatorship. Aside from everything else, we would lose our democracy as we almost [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=635.04s)]
*  did on the 6th of December, rule of law, peaceful transfer of power, the way that we choose people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=641.2s)]
*  to lead us. But at the same time, look at the emptiness that would be there in our system, that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=647.52s)]
*  a president of the United States, Donald Trump, had committed perhaps the largest offense that any [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=654.0s)]
*  president had come near to committing in all of our history, never had to pay for it, came back to office. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=659.68s)]
*  I think here's how it's gonna work. I think Bonnie Wells has suggested that she's giving him some [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=669.04s)]
*  birth. She's not gonna go till toward the end of the month. Alvin Bragg's done the same thing and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=674.64s)]
*  I think obviously Jack Smith wants to bring this one before. So as a practical matter, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=679.2s)]
*  and it's otherwise a logistical big challenge, I think we're gonna see this case [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  built for speed happening first. Oh why though? The number one aspect of this indictment to me, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  that caption, USA versus Donald Trump. He could have had seven defendants here, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=695.44s)]
*  seven times the challenges. This one is built for speed. Built for speed. Special Counsel Jack [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=700.24s)]
*  Smith did something really savvy and I think underappreciated and unexpected in this new [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=707.52s)]
*  indictment for Trump's coup attempt. He charged a single defendant in the case, Donald J. Trump. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=713.6s)]
*  Despite the fact Trump is by no means the only person involved in this criminal conspiracy to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=719.52s)]
*  steal the 2020 election, you can look at the first few pages of the indictment where half a dozen [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  co-conspirators are listed with their actions to subvert American democracy detailed through many [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=728.4s)]
*  of the remaining 40 pages. But recent legal actions taken by Smith's office imply he wants [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=733.92s)]
*  this case, the January 6th case, to go first. So let me explain. One week ago tonight we were all [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=740.16s)]
*  expecting this indictment to come out of the Washington DC federal courthouse. We were all on [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=747.76s)]
*  pins and needles but instead Smith was focused on another case a thousand miles south in Miami. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=752.8s)]
*  That day he added a third defendant in the classified documents case. He also released [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=759.36s)]
*  a superseding indictment adding new charges against the ex-president and the new defendant, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=765.76s)]
*  a Mar-a-Lago property manager. This came out of nowhere as far as we knew. It was completely [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=770.72s)]
*  unexpected and it was kind of strange because what's that going to do the case? It's going to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=775.04s)]
*  slow it down when you add a new defendant, new charges. It serves to tap the brakes on the trial [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  date in the documents case. I mean the new defendant, Carlos de la Vera, had to be arraigned. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=786.64s)]
*  Trump and his co-defendant Walt Noda had to be rearranged because there are new charges. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=791.68s)]
*  And if that were not enough to push back the documents trial date, yesterday [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=796.08s)]
*  Smith asked for a hearing to discuss potential conflicts of interest surrounding [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=800.16s)]
*  Walt Noda's defense lawyer because he has represented at least seven other clients that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=804.88s)]
*  have been interviewed in the classified documents case. So take a step back. What's the totality [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  of what we have? The Fulton County and New York prosecutors have signaled they will defer to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=814.96s)]
*  federal prosecutor on scheduling. Of course, Fonny Willis has not brought an indictment yet. We [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=819.84s)]
*  think that might be coming soon. In the past week, Smith has added a defendant in the classified [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=823.84s)]
*  documents case and requested a conflict of interest hearing. Both are things that slow [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=828.72s)]
*  down the pace of that case. Then Tuesday, Smith indicts a single defendant, Donald J. Trump, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=833.6s)]
*  in the election subversion case, does not indict the co-conspirators. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  All of that shows Smith has all the pieces in place for this case, the most important case, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=844.32s)]
*  to my mind, by far, critical to our democracy for this case to go first. It basically takes the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=850.4000000000001s)]
*  timing of a first Trump federal trial a bit out of the hands of Mar-a-Lago Judge Aileen Cannon [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=857.12s)]
*  because of these reasons for delay and centers the focus on Washington D.C. and the fate of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=862.24s)]
*  our democracy itself. Donald Trump is going to face trial for his efforts to steal the last [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=868.16s)]
*  presidential election. As the clock counts down to the next presidential election, with the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=875.04s)]
*  prosecution seeding a speedy trial, the Trump 2024 campaign is basically like the O.J. Bronco [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=879.04s)]
*  chase at this point, just running for his own freedom. To quote Maggie Hayrum in the New York [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=884.88s)]
*  Times, it bears repeating Trump's advisers are blunt privately. Their goal is for Trump to win [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=889.92s)]
*  the election in part so the cases can be disappeared by the Trump Justice Department. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=894.64s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist in the New York Times. Ellie Mistal, the justice [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=898.64s)]
*  correspondent for The Nation, where he recently wrote about the stakes of this Trump indictment. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=901.92s)]
*  They join me now. Your headline, Ellie. For Trump, the stakes of the 2024 election just became win or [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=905.92s)]
*  go to jail. Trump's only defense these charges is I'm about to be president again. Once that's off [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=911.52s)]
*  the table, he's got nothing else to fall back on. I felt the big takeaway from the arraignment today [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=916.24s)]
*  was everyone's on the same page on this. There's not even really much pretense otherwise. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=921.28s)]
*  Is it going to happen early enough? What was your takeaway by the dates exchange and the fact that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=929.04s)]
*  that was brought up in the arraignment? Yeah, so Trump's campaign for president is now not a [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=933.92s)]
*  campaign for president. It's a prison break. Yeah. And the question is simply, can he get out before [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=937.76s)]
*  the federales catch up with him? Right. Right. The hearing was really nice today because what it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=942.56s)]
*  shows is that the magistrate judge and the actual judge, Judge Fahey Chalkin, they are in cahoots. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=947.52s)]
*  They're in sync and it looks like they're going to try to move this as fast as possible and that is [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  encouraging. But we are talking about putting a former president on trial in under 15 months. And [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=957.68s)]
*  even if you think that somehow the trial goes off sometime early next year, you've got the conviction, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=964.4s)]
*  you've got the sentencing process, you've got the appeals to that process. There's just no [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=972.48s)]
*  legitimate way, I don't think, that Trump actually ends up in jail before the election, which means [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=977.36s)]
*  he is going to have the opportunity to free himself from jail by winning the presidency. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=985.36s)]
*  So I totally agree with that, but here's where I think I'm slightly more bullish on the timeline. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=990.8000000000001s)]
*  Based on everything Smith has done and Chalkin's reputation as a serious judge and the understanding [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=997.76s)]
*  that it's important for the public, for this man to be tried before the election, not the least of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1003.76s)]
*  which for the Republican Party, honestly. I really feel like it's fairest to do it in December so they [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1008.4799999999999s)]
*  can know if they're voting for a guy who's convicted of a felony. That a trial happening before the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1012.88s)]
*  general election now seems to me a real possibility, even a probability in a way it didn't before. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1018.88s)]
*  Yeah, a trial and a trial in which one of the other candidates, he'll be not a particularly [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1024.48s)]
*  serious one, is going to testify. As a witness. Yes, his vice president is going to testify [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1028.3200000000002s)]
*  against him. I mean it seems like there's very little way around that. What I find so frustrating [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  is that because these are the stakes, not what I find so frightening I should say, is because these [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1038.24s)]
*  are the stakes not just for Trump but for the country. Think about what he did both in 2016 and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1042.48s)]
*  then 2020, right? The reason that he's going on trial in New York, it might seem like a trifling [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1048.0s)]
*  case in comparison but it was also about breaking the law to get elected in 2016. He broke the law [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1053.04s)]
*  to stay in office in 2020. In both of these cases what was at stake was only his own ego. Now what's [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1058.56s)]
*  at stake is his own freedom. So just imagine he has no incentive to be restrained by the law in [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1063.44s)]
*  any regard because either he wins and he kind of assumes dictatorial powers or he loses and he goes [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1071.6s)]
*  to prison. I'll add two more to that. I mean just to your point there and it's an important one. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1077.2s)]
*  The New York case is about crimes he committed in pursuit of being elected, right? That our [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  letters transpired. This is about crimes he considered in pursuit of staying in power despite [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1086.64s)]
*  being unelected. The first impeachment was about official misconduct in pursuit of being re-elected [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1090.56s)]
*  and the case brought by Robert Mueller in which he indicted none other than Evgeny [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1098.32s)]
*  Prigozhin was for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. which was a criminal case against the criminal [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1102.72s)]
*  sabotage under take by the Russian government on Donald Trump's behalf in 2016. So like there's a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1109.52s)]
*  lot of election associated crimes. Oh absolutely but I think we also need to talk about the complete [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1114.0s)]
*  punkness of the Republican Party because one of the reasons why we're here is because none of the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1119.92s)]
*  Republicans really have the stones to stand up and talk about how this man shouldn't be the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1125.04s)]
*  nominee of their party. Chris if a Democratic front runner was under two federal indictments there [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1129.84s)]
*  would be a line of their opponents outside your door waiting for their five minutes to get up here [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1135.36s)]
*  and talk about how much they don't like the Democratic front runner but the Republicans are [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1140.0s)]
*  are so weak and so enthralled to Donald Trump that they are going to let this twice indicted person [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  run their party. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG41I6UfW0s&t=1149.84s)]
