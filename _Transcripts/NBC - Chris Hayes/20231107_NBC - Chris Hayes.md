Video Description: Chris Hayes on the Trump fraud trial: “Every judge who has a Trump trial coming up should be watching this—because it looks like a dress rehearsal to polarize opinion about the legitimacy of the proceedings themselves, rather than try to win the case within the confines of the court.”

# ‘Courtroom theatrics’ Trump uses fraud trial as ‘dress rehearsal’ for his criminal cases
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs)
*  All right, tomorrow, Ivanka Trump, former senior White House official, which is sort [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=0.0s)]
*  of still funny to say, an eldest daughter of Donald Trump, is expected to testify in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=4.96s)]
*  the New York attorney general's $250 million lawsuit against her daddy and the Trump organization. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=10.08s)]
*  She's going to have a tough act to follow after her father's preposterous performance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=16.16s)]
*  on the stand yesterday, including one incident that led the judge to tell Trump's lawyer, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=19.96s)]
*  quote, I would beseech you to control him if you can. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  If you can't, I will. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=27.2s)]
*  I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=28.2s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=30.64s)]
*  And there are also more substantive moments when Trump admitted he had signed a document [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=32.44s)]
*  making representations about his financial situation, quote, in order to induce lender [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=36.44s)]
*  to accept this guarantee and to enter into the credit agreement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=41.16s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Katie Fang points out that this, quote, a critical admission by [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=45.16s)]
*  Trump that he admits that the intent in making these financial representations was to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=49.2s)]
*  convince lenders to loan money. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  But ultimately, I think we've reached a phase of this trial where it can best be compared [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=56.08s)]
*  to the infamous Chicago seven trial in 1969, where the antiwar protesters on trial decided [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=60.2s)]
*  to turn the whole thing into a circus and, you know, put the system on trial. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=65.56s)]
*  Basically, the term that Donald Trump's attorneys have made here, even at the risk of enraging [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=69.6s)]
*  the judge who will be the lone one deciding Trump's culpability in this case. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=74.12s)]
*  More importantly, every judge who has a Trump trial coming up should be watching this because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=79.32s)]
*  it looks like a dress rehearsal to polarize opinion about the legitimacy of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=83.48s)]
*  predeceivings themselves rather than try to win the case within the confines of the court. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=88.64s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin was in the courtroom for yesterday's performance, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  she joins me now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=97.92s)]
*  Does that scam to you that there is a tactical decision? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=99.88s)]
*  There's different ways to look at this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=103.16s)]
*  One is, oh, you can't restrain Trump and he doesn't have any self-control. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=104.2s)]
*  I don't quite buy that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  The other is basically this is the tactic now is like trying to sort of bait the judge [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=109.12s)]
*  into saying something that they could use for appeal and trying to sort of convert this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=114.96s)]
*  into kind of a, you know, a polarized prism of like this judge is out to get me and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=119.28s)]
*  that's really what they're up to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=125.08s)]
*  I think it can be both. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=127.6s)]
*  I think there are moments where Trump showed he can be disciplined and partially he [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=129.16s)]
*  showed that when he started to echo things that I know his lawyers have told him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=133.72s)]
*  Right. When he talked about what you can expect during the rest of this trial, which [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=138.56s)]
*  witnesses are going to come, which important bankers will be there and which expert [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=142.68s)]
*  witnesses or he tried to pull out of his pocket somewhat preposterously the language [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=146.4s)]
*  of the disclaimer statement that appeared on each of his statements of financial [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=152.2s)]
*  condition. He's clearly fluent in some of what's going on in this case. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=155.28s)]
*  And yet I'm not sure that his explosions at the judge at Kevin Wallace, who's a lawyer [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=160.36s)]
*  with the AG's office or even at just James herself, were as calculated as people think. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=165.44s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah. So they read more organic to you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=170.64s)]
*  They felt more organic because the tone was so different. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=174.04s)]
*  You know, Chris, you and I have talked about before that as a watcher in the courtroom, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=177.2s)]
*  when Trump goes out to the hallway and he gives those impromptu press conferences for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=181.0s)]
*  security reasons, those of us who are in the courtroom can't follow him out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=184.76s)]
*  We can't watch that. When I saw video of those press conferences yesterday, I saw a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=187.76s)]
*  Trump who was remarkably more cool and collected in his tone, even if the content of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=193.24s)]
*  what he was saying was vitriolic. Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=198.4s)]
*  Then he was when he lost his cool towards Judge and Goran, towards just James, towards [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=200.12s)]
*  Kevin Wallace, when he was saying these proceedings are a disgrace, your disgrace. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=205.12s)]
*  You called me a fraud and you didn't even know me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  All of that felt very personal and very impulsive. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  OK, so that's interesting. That that feels like a person not making a tactical. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=215.68s)]
*  This is not, you know, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is someone who this is someone who has is actually struggling to control [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=221.44s)]
*  himself. I mean, there clearly is a kind of pathos here, which is that he's obsessed with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=227.04s)]
*  being people thinking he has less money than he does, basically. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=230.92s)]
*  Like, yeah. And that I mean, I guess the Occam's razor way of viewing his approach to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=234.56s)]
*  this is just that like it really stresses him out for people to think that he's poor. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=239.92s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. In fact, at one point they were talking about whether his brand value [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=243.8s)]
*  was incorporated in his financial statements. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=248.44s)]
*  He insisted that GAP allows you to do that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=251.0s)]
*  Spoiler alert for our viewers. It does not. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=253.64s)]
*  But at one point, he said, my brand value got me elected president of the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=256.2s)]
*  So he is well aware that the value of the Trump brand is part of his lore. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=260.8s)]
*  It's not only part of his lore as like control over an empire, but as a political dynasty [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=265.92s)]
*  as well. Do you think what do you think about how his performance was as a witness [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=270.52s)]
*  independent of the histrionics in terms of what it meant for what inferences on the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=276.12s)]
*  facts that the fact finder in the case of Goren can draw? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, my God, it was disastrous. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=284.8s)]
*  It was disaster. Absolutely. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=286.28s)]
*  That's interesting. You know, one of the things that I keep trying to emphasize to folks [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=287.76s)]
*  is this isn't just the remedial phase of the trial. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=291.52s)]
*  This is about six more counts that the attorney general didn't ask for summary judgment [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=294.28s)]
*  or judgment before trial on all of which necessitate proof of intent. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=298.64s)]
*  Right. On that, the attorney general got lots of helpful admissions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=303.6s)]
*  He admitted he reviewed and approved financial statements and occasionally suggested [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=307.96s)]
*  changes. He agreed he was responsible for their fair presentation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=311.64s)]
*  He agreed he talked to Jeff McConnally and Alan Weisselberg, the two top financial [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=316.16s)]
*  officials at the Trump Organization about those. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=319.76s)]
*  And he agreed at one point that he intended to forever forfeit the right to use Mar-a-Lago [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=322.72s)]
*  as anything but a private club. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=329.04s)]
*  That actually is part of a legally binding covenant document. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=331.32s)]
*  Yes. And then in the next breath, he insisted, and I have the right to change that at any point in time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=335.44s)]
*  So it's like the rules do not apply. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=340.0s)]
*  That same Trump ethos definitely translated into this proceeding. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=342.32s)]
*  But he nonetheless made a number of really damaging admissions. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=346.12s)]
*  If you could see beyond the temper tantrums. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=349.68s)]
*  Do you think the judge does? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=352.04s)]
*  I think the judge absolutely does. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=354.04s)]
*  And I think the judge is much more facile with and familiar with the documents than [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=356.16s)]
*  Trump himself is. And so, you know, Trump's insistence, you won't let me read from this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=360.96s)]
*  document. You're not letting me complete the record. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=364.84s)]
*  That phrase, the disclaimer statement is in every single one of financial statements. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=367.32s)]
*  That's part of the record already at the case. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=372.52s)]
*  God, exhausting. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=375.08s)]
*  I'm exhausted on your and the judge's behalf. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=376.48s)]
*  Listening to you recounting this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=380.4s)]
*  Better you than me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=383.48s)]
*  I have no idea what to say to that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=384.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  You than me. I'm glad you're there for us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=386.4s)]
*  I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuNe89NqMs&t=388.08s)]
