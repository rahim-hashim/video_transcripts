# ‘Jump scare’: Stormy Daniels testifies about sexual encounter with Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc)
*  Joining me now are two people who watched this all happen live at the courthouse MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Former deputy assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice Harry lemon. It's great to have you guys both here [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=5.84s)]
*  Well, let's just start in the morning [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=11.76s)]
*  Which is we didn't know that Stephanie Clifford Stormy Daniels was going to take the stand today, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=13.84s)]
*  We did not I was standing in line waiting to get into the courtroom when the Associated Press [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=19.56s)]
*  Reported this morning that Stormy Daniels would be the witness and I have to tell you I was really surprised for a couple of reasons [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=25.180000000000003s)]
*  One I was surprised that it hadn't gotten out before but I was also surprised given where we were in the case [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=31.0s)]
*  We heard perhaps the driest day of testimony in the trial so far yesterday all about the false [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Documents or the allegedly false business records that constitute the heart of the crime that's been charged here [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  To then go from that and instead of moving forward with other witnesses who would testify about those false business records to go sort [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=51.42s)]
*  Of backward in time, but also upward in interest right to Stormy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=59.1s)]
*  Daniels was I think a little bit of a surprise narratively for me [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=63.86s)]
*  Well, you know we didn't know in the morning [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=67.42s)]
*  But actually before the jury came in the defense raised something about her testimony [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=69.92s)]
*  So we knew it was gonna be she before the jury did right so we could watch them very there was a definite [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=76.74s)]
*  Freesome, you know when it happened [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=83.1s)]
*  Whoa, and you could really zone in on the jury and their keen interest. This was a name [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=85.1s)]
*  They've been waiting to hear yes, and obviously the most famous other person I think involved in this encounter [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=92.02s)]
*  So alright, so you've got direct examination before you get into it. Let me hear from you each of you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=98.14s)]
*  How you view the what is important about if you're setting up this on direct like what do you need if you're the prosecution? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=104.06s)]
*  Out of this witness Lisa [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=111.42s)]
*  I'll tell you what the prosecution said because it was largely what I anticipated that they would say [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=112.86s)]
*  Which is you need Stormy Daniels in the case because you need her to elaborate on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=117.7s)]
*  What she would have told the public had she in October of 2016? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=122.86s)]
*  Not signed any agreement at all [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  But instead come forward you need the jury to believe that so that they can understand better what Trump's motivation [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=129.9s)]
*  Was for entering into the conspiracy in the first place and authorizing Michael Cohen according to the prosecutor to enter into the hush money [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=136.3s)]
*  settlement [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=144.46s)]
*  You need to see her [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=146.02s)]
*  Is legally tangential, but she's narratively at the heart the jury is curious [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=148.5s)]
*  She's the human figure that puts everything in motion [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  You need the jury will be dissatisfied if it doesn't get a glimpse of her and hear her story now when I saw that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=159.06s)]
*  She was gonna be on one of the challenges for a witness like this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  The way that human beings work is that when we tell the same story over and over again [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=169.7s)]
*  We don't tell it the same way every time this is just how people are it's how memory functions and one of the things that happens [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=173.38s)]
*  litigation or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=180.34s)]
*  Criminal trials is when you have someone you want them like they do their deposition then you don't want them talking a lot about it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=181.58s)]
*  Because then they're up there and you can say well you said this here and this here, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  So you've got this person in her that she's talked about this quite a bit. We played her on Jimmy Kimmel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=190.86s)]
*  She's in a peacock. You know, there's this you wrote a book like so [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=197.18s)]
*  What was your expectation of what kind of witness she would be and how was she? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, so let's start with the premise that the problem you identified is a problem for virtually every witness across this trial [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=205.92s)]
*  And it's something that the prosecutors talked to prospective jurors about during voir dire [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=213.56s)]
*  They basically said to them people's memories fluctuate the events at hand here happened a long time ago [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  And you won't blame people if there are minor inconsistencies in their stories because you'll understand that's human nature, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=222.54s)]
*  And so they're prepared for that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=228.56s)]
*  But what makes Stormy Daniels even more different than that is that she's got a story here that's rooted in a sexual trauma [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=230.6s)]
*  Yes, she said today Trump never physically or verbally threatened her but it's clear in her retelling of the story that it is a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=238.28s)]
*  Problematic sexual encounter from her perspective and like many sexual trauma victims [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  For her some of the details that are most memorable and vivid aren't necessarily the ones that are cognizable or even [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=250.32s)]
*  Important or relevant for a court of law and so confining her story [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=256.56s)]
*  To what the court thinks is important and what the defense will tolerate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=261.8s)]
*  Her testifying to is an added challenge on top of those inconsistencies built from the fact that these events happened [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=266.68s)]
*  You know the 2006 sexual encounter between them was 18 years ago [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=274.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's true as to the sexual act itself because Murchon was very concerned that it could be prejudicial to Trump [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=277.88s)]
*  So there's some sort of guardrails here about what she can and can't say [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=285.16s)]
*  That's right and she speaks quickly and the DA doesn't control her that much and Murchon like I've never seen them all during the trial [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  Is piqued and actually at one point makes his own objection and sustains it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  He thinks they go too far, but that's at this core narrative of the sex itself more broadly. She tells a story a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=302.52s)]
*  Sort of version of an American success story that said once [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=310.36s)]
*  Hard Scrabble but [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=314.32s)]
*  Exotic for lack of a better word [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=316.32s)]
*  She you know she really comes she tells she humanizes herself to the jury [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=317.88s)]
*  Which they're gonna need because all they know is that she's a adult film actress and she tells something [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=322.86s)]
*  That's that to really kind of try to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=328.56s)]
*  Dimensionalize herself as an actual human being with hopes dreams a career different things [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=332.04s)]
*  She's done precisely and yet it's an unusual [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=336.32s)]
*  You know does the jury get next to it because it's also there's a sensational kind of exotic aspect to it, right [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=339.6s)]
*  That thing that you said I think actually is really relevant to in terms of this question about motivation [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=345.96s)]
*  Cuz I was I was following along today and a number of people noted and I think this actually comes up on cross that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=351.36s)]
*  It has a darker cast her telling of the story is less sort of like the foolishly like [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=356.16s)]
*  What kind of and more like this is gross this is icky and she's very clear [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  She was not sexual assault. This was consent in a legal sense, but in terms of her [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  Subjective experience of it. She's in a power position. It felt she kind of got badgered into it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  There's an imbalance of power and she testified to looking up at the ceiling at one point and thinking to herself [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=379.88s)]
*  How did I during the actual sexual how did I miss read this situation? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  How did I get to here and I have to tell you Chris for me [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=391.28s)]
*  Where that called me back to is May of 2023 sitting in a federal courthouse [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=395.24s)]
*  Not that far away thinking about an eGene Carroll who was a victim of a sexual assault thinking to herself after bantering with Trump [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=399.88s)]
*  thinking she was gonna have a cocktail party story in that Bergdorf Goodman lingerie floor and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=407.24s)]
*  Walking out after the assault [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=412.96s)]
*  Shaken thinking what? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=415.56s)]
*  What did I do to let it go here so here's my was murky and she was sort of disassociated [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=418.44s)]
*  At that in the in the key event [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=424.88s)]
*  Here was my light bulb moment about this testimony today from afar was putting two and two together [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=427.64s)]
*  Which is to say it's the access Hollywood tape is the biggest crisis the Trump campaign faces many people calling for him to leave [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=432.88s)]
*  subsequent accusations [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=439.56s)]
*  On the record by actual women who say he sexually assaulted me. He croaked me [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=441.56s)]
*  This story told in the way she told it today is a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=446.36s)]
*  Seems like much more of a possible death blow [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=452.32s)]
*  And then the version that I think had been maybe communicated before or how I understand it, which was like [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=455.32s)]
*  Work, yeah, but foolish hijinks and less predatory and the reason that seemed to matter to me is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=463.16s)]
*  Because of the the motive here, which is that this is about the campaign, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=470.0s)]
*  And you know to put it even a finer point on it when you're talking about literally the campaign on a day-by-day basis [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=474.32s)]
*  Stormy Daniels signs the first iteration of this non-disclosure agreement that is not paid for by the Trump people on the same day that the New [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  York Times reports that these other women are coming out of the woodwork to say that they have been sexually assaulted by Trump [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=488.4s)]
*  This is all happening in succession of day by day by day [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=493.96s)]
*  Starting with October 7th and the Washington Post reporting the access Hollywood tape [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=497.32s)]
*  November 10th is the day that the New York Times reports these other women and Stormy Daniels signs for the first time [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  But she doesn't sign the real agreement the one that gets funded until October 28th [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=506.46s)]
*  And meanwhile the Trump campaign is fighting valiantly to get out from under [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=511.76s)]
*  The access Hollywood tape and the weight of it including all of these prominent Republicans who don't want to associate themselves with him anymore [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=516.6999999999999s)]
*  Had she told this story that this would have been [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  Devastating what hope Hicks called a crisis would have been catastrophe [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=528.78s)]
*  But you know until then what we've had is all this sort of maneuvering hush money. This was Trump the grotesque [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=532.7s)]
*  This was Trump the foul kind of monstrous figure that is what exactly what they were scared of in October of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=539.14s)]
*  2016 it's also the move for the mistrial want to talk about that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=547.26s)]
*  You [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSUjDJZcxlc&t=558.22s)]
