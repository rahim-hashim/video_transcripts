# 'Monopoly money' Why Trump's Truth Social deal may not help his $454M bond
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as)
*  So time is running out for Donald Trump to secure a bond covering the nearly half a billion dollars [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=0.0s)]
*  He owes in a New York civil fraud judgment against his business [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=4.46s)]
*  The ex-president now has just three days left to find someone willing to issue him that bond [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  If he wants to avoid actually coughing up the cash while he appeals [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=12.72s)]
*  At the beginning of the week Trump's lawyers claimed in a court filing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=17.12s)]
*  It was quote not possible for him to obtain a bond for the full amount of his judgment which comes to five hundred and fifty [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=20.16s)]
*  $454 million they said that Trump had been rejected by 30 companies who issue bonds that sparked a whole lot of speculation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  About how he may have to sell off some of his assets or that they could even be seized by New York State [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=34.42s)]
*  Trump of course owns a significant amount of valuable property in New York and several other states today the ex-president [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=40.58s)]
*  Appeared to break some news about his financial status in a lengthy all caps early morning post on true social Trump claimed that he has [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=47.22s)]
*  Plenty of money the back of the bond quote through hard work talent and luck [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=54.94s)]
*  I currently have almost five hundred million dollars in cash [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  This declaration brings up an important question if it is true. He has half a billion dollars lying around [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  Why did his lawyers tell the court that no one would give him a bond for less than that amount? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=66.66s)]
*  Either lawyers were lying or Donald Trump is lying. You can probably guess which is more likely [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=71.46s)]
*  But it is certainly possible Trump will be able to pull a rabbit out of a hat and secure a bond by Monday [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=76.86s)]
*  In fact, there's a huge real development today that could just do the trick. Although it's a little unclear [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=82.78s)]
*  Trump's media company which includes truth social became a public company through a merger [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=89.98s)]
*  That will raise Trump's wealth by billions of dollars and potentially help pay his mounting legal bills as in your Times explains it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=95.58s)]
*  Trump Media and Technology Group is poised to debut on Wall Street at a market value of around five billion dollars [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  The ex-president owns more than 60% of the company which works out to about three billion dollars [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=108.14s)]
*  However, there are restrictions in the merger agreement that prevent major shareholders from selling shares for at least six months [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=113.22s)]
*  We're using them as collateral for loans [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  but because Trump controls so much of Trump Media and because his allies are expected to make a majority of the board [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=121.44s)]
*  The members of the board could waive those restrictions on request [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=128.18s)]
*  Got all that. So with the clock ticking, I don't know [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=132.66s)]
*  Can he get it done by Monday? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=136.62s)]
*  Let's ask Adam Reese who's a reporter for NBC News [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=138.54s)]
*  Closely following the story and he joins me now Adam. Great to have you here. Thank you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=142.66s)]
*  All right, he says he has the cash on truth social [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=146.18s)]
*  But if he had the cash then we probably wouldn't be in this situation, right? Is that a fair determination? Yeah [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=149.38s)]
*  When the EG and Carol case happened, he had the bond he had the money for the bond, but he was still asking [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=155.02s)]
*  The court for more time so it's possible he actually has the money right now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=161.94s)]
*  I don't think that's the case [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=166.86s)]
*  So we're going to get to Monday and it's going to be a showdown and and we'll see what happens showdown [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=169.18s)]
*  We're like showdown at court like with judge and Goran. Well, we need to keep a close eye on the docket [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=174.34s)]
*  Judge and Goran is tightening is tightening the screws on him. The monitor is there the Trump organization [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=179.5s)]
*  Essentially can't do anything without the court and the monitor knowing she is on top of it [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=185.9s)]
*  She's been there for about 16 months anything they do transfers of funds financial accounting moving money from one source to another [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  She's going to know about it and report back to the court. Okay, so one way this could go down is this media merger, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=199.58s)]
*  Where it Trump media is merging with this company. That's already I guess a public company right there like a one of these special [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=206.94000000000003s)]
*  vehicles right a SPAC, right and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  This happened today the the digital world [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=215.7s)]
*  That's who he's gonna merge with their stock price plunged more than 13% Friday to just under thirty seven dollars because Trump will own [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  Roughly 78 million shares in the post merger company the fallen price cut Trump's paper [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=225.14s)]
*  Take from the deal by around four hundred and fifty seven million, which is rough. That's exactly how much he owns [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  That's how much the stock declined today, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=234.61999999999998s)]
*  But the big question is like could because the deals happening [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Could you then go get use the your stock as collateral for a loan to get a bond? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=240.14s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance that can happen. It went public. It's worth about five billion allegedly on paper [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=245.14s)]
*  He has 60% of it at three billion. Can he sell that it's locked up for a period of time [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=252.33999999999997s)]
*  Even if it gets unlocked, can he sell that stock to me? It's essentially monopoly money [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=258.02s)]
*  Why just because you're sick? Well, obviously you can't go into a market with 60% of the shares without [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=264.82s)]
*  Utterly destroying the value of the stock and also you need enough people that want to invest in true social [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=271.29999999999995s)]
*  Yes, you have to find buyers, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=276.9s)]
*  So you think that is but I guess in the shorter term like you don't see a way that he basically uses [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=278.7s)]
*  Some waiver from the board over the weekend to then take stock as collateral for a bond. It doesn't appear that's even possible [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  Okay that that that you don't think that's happening. That's not a scenario that's feasible at all [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so when you say showdown on Monday, so what? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=297.14s)]
*  Walk me through what we are interested. I think that the attorney general is not going to slap a sticker on trump tower [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=301.14s)]
*  That's just not their style. I think there are many people who would like that to happen. I'm just pointing that out [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=308.58s)]
*  Yes, I agree with you FBI agents with FBI jackets storming the place or like, you know [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=313.7s)]
*  Like chains with like a lot like a master lock in front. I think it's more likely we're going to see some type of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=318.9s)]
*  Attachment to his maybe his Schwab accounts. He used some Schwab accounts to pay eGene Carroll [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=326.24s)]
*  Some of more liquid assets is something they're more likely to take than some of his buildings [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=332.74s)]
*  Which not only have lost value but are leveraged and and are already encumbered [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=339.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's funny when we put up those graphics some of the things you'll see like trump world tower [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=345.14s)]
*  Which net value of nineteen point eight million dollars you're like, well that doesn't seem enough [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=349.3s)]
*  But that's because there's a bunch of condos already sold [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=353.3s)]
*  So it's it's it's less than it might might appear [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=356.26s)]
*  There's other buildings that have big outstanding loans against some mortgages essentially. So let me ask you a technical question [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=358.58s)]
*  We say that charles Schwab again. This is way outside my [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=363.7s)]
*  normal area of expertise, but [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  I guess can the government just like yoink like reach into your charles Schwab account and be like this money is now ours [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  They can now [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  They've already gotten the court order [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=377.62s)]
*  All they don't need to go back to the court they can go to the sheriff [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=380.02s)]
*  And if if that's the case and they can do it they could have done it weeks ago [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  But they've given the trump organization a grace period that takes us to monday and that's the deadline [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=389.06s)]
*  You [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5B5SVC0as&t=409.62s)]
