# ‘What the boss wants’: Allegations to delete video footage hits home for Trump in new charges
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo)
*  Barbara McCrae is a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. She's now a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=0.0s)]
*  professor at the University of Michigan Law School, and she joins me now. I asked Laura [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=3.84s)]
*  this question, but I want to ask you, Barb. What, as you read this indictment, is the biggest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=8.96s)]
*  peril? What was the biggest legal peril to Donald Trump? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=13.68s)]
*  Well, I think this detail of obstruction of justice, about what the boss wants, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=17.52s)]
*  is incredibly important. As Laura said, prosecutors refer to this as consciousness of guilt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=21.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's defense throughout this whole thing has been, I get every right to hold on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=27.76s)]
*  to those documents. If that were true, there would be no need to destroy video of people moving these [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=31.44s)]
*  boxes around. And so this really hits home with this obstruction of justice charge. Certainly the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  addition of the Bedminster document is interesting, but it was already in the indictment. So I think [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  this new obstruction is really fascinating. And it would be useful perhaps to have the new defendant [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=48.56s)]
*  flip, but I don't think it's necessary that with this employee number four, who clearly was, you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=54.56s)]
*  know, in the closet with him and heard what he had to say. And so I think this is just really [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  powerful evidence that makes that obstruction of justice scheme really, it seems to me, very [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=65.92s)]
*  difficult to defend against. Now, we didn't expect this today. Maybe you were, Barb, you could tell [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=73.92s)]
*  us, but most of us were not expecting this today. There's one specific document, this Iran war plan [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=78.96s)]
*  document that's in here, but there are of course a number of other documents that are listed in the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  original indictment and we're listed again here that are classified documents. Do you think this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=88.8s)]
*  is the last superseding indictment or could there be more that Jack Smith and his team and the grand [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  jury could be considering? You never know. I've had cases I've seen go up to like, you know, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  seventh superseding indictment, but I think in this case there might be a reason to refrain from [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=104.64s)]
*  doing that, even if you thought you could keep adding more evidence. And that's the clock, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=110.4s)]
*  because every time you supersede, there is an argument by the defense that that should push out [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  the trial date. We'll see if Donald Trump tries to do that, because we just got that May trial date [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  from the judge in this case, which struck me as a rather reasonable amount of time. But now with the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=124.16s)]
*  new defendant who's got to get his lawyer up to speed and Donald Trump will say these are new facts, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=127.76s)]
*  new allegations, we're going to have to obtain more discovery about all this. There is a reason [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=133.92s)]
*  to kick that date down the road. And so every time you supersede, there is that risk of extending the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  trial date. And in this case, unique to this case, is on the other end is of course the election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think prosecutors have to be cognizant that that is a really ticking clock out there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=151.04s)]
*  So it sounds like they could make an argument to extend the trial date past the May date that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=156.32s)]
*  Aileen Cannon just set. Do you think that's something we could hear more about soon? Could [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  that be an ask that the Trump team is going to cannon with in the coming days? Or how quickly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=165.6s)]
*  does that happen? Yeah, I think they'll wait for the arraignment of the new defendant first, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=170.32s)]
*  which will likely take place soon, I would imagine. And then shortly after that date, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=176.72s)]
*  it would seem appropriate for the parties to ask to reset dates in this case in light of additional [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=181.44s)]
*  discovery and that defendant's ability to get up to speed. So I would say after the arraignment, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=187.44s)]
*  I think we should expect in a short period of time a request for additional time. So we were [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=192.64s)]
*  waiting for news on a different indictment, of course, this morning, which we didn't receive. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=198.96s)]
*  Received this instead. How does this impact or does it impact at all the timeline of the indictment [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=203.28s)]
*  on the effort to overturn the election and Donald Trump's involvement in that? I don't think it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=209.92s)]
*  impacts the indictment that may be filed, which I think is a real certainty that it's coming. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=215.92s)]
*  My guess is it's probably not coming until after those remaining witnesses testify who are scheduled [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=221.28s)]
*  for August. So I'm a little less inclined to think it's coming in the next couple of days, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=226.48s)]
*  but I do think there is some significance to the timing here. So if the trial date in the Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=232.56s)]
*  case gets pushed out to say June or July, I think this one probably trails behind. And so every [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  in a time something like this happens, we could see the January 6 trial getting pushed into [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=244.08s)]
*  late summer, early fall of 2024. And at some point, the arguments that were too close to an election [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=249.36s)]
*  actually has some merit. And so I think the prosecutors need to keep the heat on and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=256.24s)]
*  get these indictments filed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=260.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8T32y6iKxo&t=274.08s)]
