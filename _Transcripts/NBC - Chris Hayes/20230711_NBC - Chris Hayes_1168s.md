# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs)
*  Jeffrey Clark is a former official in the Trump Department of Justice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=0.0s)]
*  You may remember his home was searched by the FBI in June of last year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=5.0s)]
*  He was left waiting outside in his underwear as they executed the search warrant and seized his phone. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=10.0s)]
*  It was all part of the ongoing investigation into the ex-president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=16.0s)]
*  Well, Jeffery Clark now faces potential disbarment in Washington, D.C., related to his false claims of voter fraud in Georgia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=23.0s)]
*  Clark is also the guy who pushed the theory that a voting machine had accessed the Internet through, wait for it, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=32.0s)]
*  a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=39.0s)]
*  And this guy has now emerged as a favorite to become the next attorney general if Donald Trump wins a second term, as Ankush Cardori reports in New York Magazine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=47.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Ankush Cardori. He's a former federal prosecutor for the Department of Justice and a contributing editor for New York Magazine, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=57.0s)]
*  where his new article is titled, The Sequel Will Be Worse, Trump's Former Justice Department Officials Fear a Second Term. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=64.0s)]
*  Ankush, it's so good to have you here. You had the opportunity to talk to several senior officials from Trump's Justice Department [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=72.0s)]
*  about what a second Trump term would mean for the DOJ. Lay out the highlights of what you learned from those conversations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=78.0s)]
*  The biggest takeaway for me was that almost everyone volunteered that they were concerned that Trump would effectively turn the Justice Department against his political enemies. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=85.0s)]
*  Well, Trump himself has been talking about doing that in the wake of his indictment by a special counsel's office. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=95.0s)]
*  And Trump did, of course, attempt to sort of use the Justice Department to his benefit, to help his allies, to punish his foes during his first administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=102.0s)]
*  And even though there were some criminal investigations of his political opponents, people like FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and so forth, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=111.0s)]
*  one of those progressed to an actual criminal prosecution. And the thing that I heard over and over again in the course of this reporting was people were concerned that he will do this again. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=119.0s)]
*  He will be more aggressive about it. And he may be able to staff the department with more client people who will carry out his orders. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=127.0s)]
*  You know, just hours after Trump was arraigned in that classified documents case, he said this in a speech at his New Jersey golf club. Take a listen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=134.0s)]
*  I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden and the entire Biden family. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=143.0s)]
*  I mean, Ankush, let's be very clear here. Hunter Biden has already been prosecuted by the Department of Justice. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=156.0s)]
*  It's not like the DOJ is asleep at the wheel for crimes that are being committed or alleged crimes that are being committed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=166.0s)]
*  When you spoke to people about his threats to prosecute Biden and his family, what did they tell you? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=173.0s)]
*  Well, look, there is a definite reservoir of skepticism among Republicans, conservatives, people who staff the last Justice Department about the handling of the Hunter Biden prosecution. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=179.0s)]
*  I don't want to sort of totally downplay that. However, I don't think that people who the people from the first term adopt this framework that Trump is espousing at all. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=189.0s)]
*  They do not think that there is this sort of invariable two track system of justice that's, you know, one track is about pursuing him and the other track is about just letting everyone off. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=200.0s)]
*  So for the most part, you know, people didn't buy this this sort of theory of the case, but found it worrisome precisely because, you know, it's been one thing for people like you and me to be concerned about a scenario like this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=210.0s)]
*  We were concerned during the first administration concerned about a potential second administration, but he's now telling us this very, very explicitly that this is what he intends to do, that he intends to turn the Justice Department against Joe Biden and his family and potentially other political opponents of his. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah, but on because she's already done that, though. I mean, it's not like it was a secret. It's not like he intends on doing it. He weaponized the IRS. He went after other people. They were like they were audited, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=236.0s)]
*  I mean, it was Comey and McCabe. They were actually audited. I mean, it's not like he actually he hasn't already used federal agencies in order to do this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=248.0s)]
*  But one way that he did it that you learned and that we've seen, he took people that were acting in these rules or he put them in these rules and they didn't have to be Senate confirmed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=257.0s)]
*  They didn't have to go through an official process to do it. Is that a concern that was been articulated to you when you were preparing this piece that that's how Trump's going to go and weaponize more agencies, including the DOJ? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. In fact, the concern that I heard more than once was precisely this this issue about Trump's ability to staff the department more easily now that he knows he can get acting officials put in place pretty quickly and that he may not even need people to be Senate confirmed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=278.0s)]
*  And as we learned from the last his last administration, at the very end, he had a lot of people who are acting in place, including Jeffrey Clark. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=293.0s)]
*  And those people were left with a fair amount of very, very significant power. So that particular point of it, part of it, you are absolutely right to raise because I think a lot of people felt like, okay, his first term, you know, he's still sort of learning how the government works. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=302.0s)]
*  He knows now, right? He knows that he can skirt some of these sort of personnel issues and sort of get his way with the department that way as well. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=315.0s)]
*  You know, on this, I have to let you go. I got like 20 seconds here, but I just wanted to note, you know, Jeffrey Clark, he signed off on briefs that got the DOJ involved with aging Carol's defamation case. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=323.0s)]
*  And he also got involved in the Stephanie Wolkoff case as well, where the DOJ sued her. I mean, it's not like he hasn't already used people like Jeffrey Clark. He plucks them out of obscurity and he uses them anyway. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=333.0s)]
*  On Kush Cardori, thanks for the reporting. It's pretty strong. I appreciate it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=345.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=348.0s)]
*  The state's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill in May, just weeks before he announced his run for president. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=353.0s)]
*  The law bans local governments from issuing ID cards to people who cannot prove citizenship. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=359.0s)]
*  It requires hospitals that accept Medicaid funds to ask about a patient's citizenship status. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=364.0s)]
*  It also increases penalties for people who hire or transport undocumented immigrants. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=370.0s)]
*  And it expands the use of e-Verify, a federal database employers can use to check a worker's immigration status. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=375.0s)]
*  Florida's strict new immigration law, courtesy of Ron DeSantis, just may backfire, driving away the very people the state relies upon for its agricultural backbone. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=383.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports that just days after the law went into effect, agricultural and construction businesses are already experiencing a labor shortage. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=394.0s)]
*  And the law could also pose a threat to Florida's other main industry, tourism. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=403.0s)]
*  The State Department of Motor Vehicles said some driver's licenses issued by other states will no longer be recognized as valid, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=407.0s)]
*  releasing a list of four New England states which issue some licenses that do not meet the new law's criteria. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=414.0s)]
*  How long the law remains in effect is uncertain as the Department of Justice fights it in court. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=421.0s)]
*  But as the summer season wears on, the practical effects of the law may take hold sooner than later. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=427.0s)]
*  Florida State Representative Anna Escamani is a Democrat serving the people of Orlando. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=433.0s)]
*  She was elected to the Florida House in 2018 after she flipped a formerly Republican district. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=438.0s)]
*  She herself is a daughter of immigrants and she joins me now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=443.0s)]
*  Representative, it's always so good to see you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=447.0s)]
*  You represent a district in central Florida, including parts of Orlando and its suburbs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=449.0s)]
*  Tell me how your constituents are reacting to this new law and how it's impacting them directly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=454.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Katie. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=460.0s)]
*  It's great to see you here. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=462.0s)]
*  My constituents are incredibly frustrated by this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=464.0s)]
*  Not only do we just have a diverse community in central Florida that embraces our immigrant neighbors, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=467.0s)]
*  but as you mentioned in your introduction, we're seeing ramifications in multiple industries from agriculture to tourism to construction. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=473.0s)]
*  We're facing a housing affordability crisis and we need labor. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=483.0s)]
*  We need the support of diverse people to help lift up our communities and to ensure that we have strong workforce to sustain our growth. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=488.0s)]
*  And this policy is pushing out so many hardworking Floridians. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=497.0s)]
*  And of course, under Governor DeSantis, we're not seeing any real solutions being proposed to actually solve any of the challenges we face with immigration. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=502.0s)]
*  So it's been really, really frustrating. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=512.0s)]
*  And of course, the economic effect is being felt already. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=514.0s)]
*  A lot of this is being framed as Governor DeSantis doing things, getting things done, but he can't do any of this without his state legislature. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=518.0s)]
*  So what kind of justifications and excuses have you been hearing from your Republican colleagues in Tallahassee who are driving these hard right turns right alongside Ron DeSantis? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=526.0s)]
*  Well, as most folks probably assume, there is no backbone in the Republican Party of Florida right now, despite even having farmers in the legislature who now admit that this policy was 100% politically motivated. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=538.0s)]
*  The GOP got right in line to support DeSantis, pushing for these extreme policies that are out of touch with the everyday American, let alone the average Floridian. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=552.0s)]
*  And again, I think we can all share commonality that we want to see solutions when it comes to immigration, but this isn't it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=563.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal's notoriously conservative editorial board actually went so far as to call this immigration bill a, quote, misfire. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=571.0s)]
*  Writing the law will, quote, dent the state's economic expansion, which has produced a jobs and tax revenue boom. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=580.0s)]
*  It makes no sense for DeSantis to punish his own state, even as he vows to clean up the mess in Washington. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=587.0s)]
*  But Representative DeSantis has made it clear he wants to make America, Florida. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=593.0s)]
*  You know, it just came out right now that Florida is now America's inflation hotspot with Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach having the highest inflation rate of metro areas with more than two and a half million residents with a 9% inflation rate for the 12 months that ended in April. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=599.0s)]
*  That's more than double the national average of 4%. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=615.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're an American not living in Florida, this doesn't bode well for you if DeSantis is courting you for his vote, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=617.0s)]
*  Of course not. I mean, Floridians cannot afford Florida right now. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=624.0s)]
*  While DeSantis pursues his culture wars and attack immigrants, we cannot afford our rent. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=629.0s)]
*  Property insurance is out of control. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=634.0s)]
*  We see increases in our food pantries and demand for food pantries at a neighborhood level. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=636.0s)]
*  Things are really bad here in our state. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=643.0s)]
*  And of course, DeSantis is nowhere to be seen because he's too busy trying to curry favor with Iowa caucus voters while he continues to ignore the real challenges we face in the Sunshine State. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=645.0s)]
*  Representative, before I have to let you go, this new statistic came in. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=656.0s)]
*  Workers at several construction sites in South Florida saying a quarter to half of their teams are gone. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=660.0s)]
*  I mean, DeSantis is destroying agriculture and construction industries in the state of Florida, but Florida homeowners are facing grotesque insurance rates, insurance bills. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=666.0s)]
*  They can't even get insurance to insure their homes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=676.0s)]
*  And Floridians are facing existential threats because of climate change. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=679.0s)]
*  But are these issues just too woke for Ron DeSantis? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=683.0s)]
*  That's the sad part of it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=686.0s)]
*  You know, we've seen Governor DeSantis and other Republicans just continue to distract and deflect through culture wars. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=690.0s)]
*  And I will say this is an opportunity for Democrats, including the Biden administration, to be true problem solvers and provide solutions, whether it's a climate crisis, the cost of living, or in the context of this conversation, real solutions to immigration. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=696.0s)]
*  This is a time for Democrats to lead. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=709.0s)]
*  Florida State Representative Anna Eskamani, as always, I'm grateful for your insight. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=712.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=716.0s)]
*  Ultra conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is no stranger to scandal. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=719.0s)]
*  Last year, in the midst of the January 6th Committee's investigation, we learned that his wife, Ginny, exchanged dozens of text messages with Trump's chief of staff in her attempts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=724.0s)]
*  Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Clarence Thomas refused to recuse himself from cases relating to the election or to January 6th. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=736.0s)]
*  This year, ProPublica broke a series of reports exposing an undisclosed relationship that Justice maintained with a billionaire Republican donor named Harlan Crowe. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=744.0s)]
*  Crowe took Thomas on several all-expenses paid luxurious vacations worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=753.0s)]
*  He paid for his grandnephew's private school tuition as well. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=761.0s)]
*  He even purchased the Justice's mother's home. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=764.0s)]
*  Justice Thomas did not disclose any of those lavish gifts. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=768.0s)]
*  The Washington Post recently reported that Federalist Society co-chairman Leonard Leo directed tens of thousands of dollars of business to the firm of Thomas's wife Ginny while keeping her name off the billing paperwork. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=772.0s)]
*  And now, the New York Times has just published the latest story of Thomas's association with an exclusive organization called the Horatio Alger Association, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=785.0s)]
*  where Clarence Thomas, quote, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=796.0s)]
*  moved into the inner circle, a cluster of extraordinarily wealthy, largely conservative members who lionized him and all that he had achieved. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=798.0s)]
*  He has granted it unusual access to the Supreme Court, where every year he presides over the group's signature event, a ceremony in the courtroom at which he places Horatio Alger medals around the necks of new lifetime members. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=808.0s)]
*  One entrepreneur called it the closest thing to being knighted in the United States. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=821.0s)]
*  His friendships forged through Horatio Alger have brought him proximity to a lifestyle of unimaginable material privilege. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=827.0s)]
*  Over the years, his Horatio Alger friends have welcomed him at their vacation retreats, arranged VIP access to sporting events, and invited him to their lavish parties. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=835.0s)]
*  Joining me now is one of the reporters who broke the story, Steve Eder, investigative reporter for the New York Times. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=846.0s)]
*  Steve, this is another blockbuster piece about Clarence Thomas. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=853.0s)]
*  And in it, it's pretty fair to say Clarence Thomas's relationship with this organization is a significant and meaningful one. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=857.0s)]
*  How specifically has Thomas benefited from the connections and the friendships he's forged with not only fellow members, but also with other Horatio Alger friends? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=864.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, thanks for having me. And yeah, it's an important piece, I think, to look at this aspect of Justice Thomas's career. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=874.0s)]
*  You know, I think when you look at the Horatio Alger Association, it is this group, it kind of does two things. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=883.0s)]
*  There's a scholarship aspect to it that involves kids and giving away money, but there's also a network there of powerful, of wealthy people. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=889.0s)]
*  And Clarence Thomas, for a long time, has been very much at the center of this organization in certain ways and befriended people who are in and around this organization, kind of at the core of it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=898.0s)]
*  And that has led to various benefits for him, to these parts of these friendships. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=909.0s)]
*  There's trips to Florida, there's ranch visits in Montana, lavish birthday parties, access to sporting events, and things of that nature that you see when you start to trace through these relationships. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=914.0s)]
*  Steve, I mean, let's be frank, who wouldn't want to rub elbows with Oprah Winfrey and Denzel Washington? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=925.0s)]
*  Before tonight's show, I actually went to the membership directory for the Horatio Alger Organization, because look, it's not just super conservative people and Republicans. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=931.0s)]
*  I mean, it's everybody, right, that really meets the requirements to join this organization. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=940.0s)]
*  But let me be clear, there are titans of industry in this organization, from aerospace to tech to energy and electronics. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=945.0s)]
*  I mean, it's inevitable that cases involving these areas might end up before SCOTUS. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=951.0s)]
*  But Steve, can you really place something if it seems to be nothing more than just a club or organization membership? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's one of the issues here is it relates to disclosure and what's disclosed and what's not disclosed. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=963.0s)]
*  And that's been a big theme in the ethics discussion around the Supreme Court. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=970.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons that this caught our eye are the types of relationships, the business relationships, the range of industries that come into play here. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=974.0s)]
*  And so, you know, it comes down to, in some ways, a disclosure question and a transparency issue. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=981.0s)]
*  And what actually is disclosed? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=988.0s)]
*  And in a lot of these cases, many of the cases that we noted, it wasn't disclosed. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=990.0s)]
*  You report that Justice Thomas received benefits, quote, from a broader cohort of wealthy and powerful friends. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=997.0s)]
*  They've included major donors to conservative causes with broad policy and political interests and much at stake in Supreme Court decisions, even if they were not directly involved in the cases. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1003.0s)]
*  Is there any way, Steve, to be able to quantify the types of benefits that Clarence Thomas has received over the years? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1015.0s)]
*  Well, based on the disclosures alone that he makes, such as required annual disclosures that federal judges make, you know, there's what's disclosed. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1024.0s)]
*  You often see, you'll see teaching, you'll see speeches, you'll see things of that nature. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1032.0s)]
*  I think where, what we're running into here is these other kinds of benefits and hospitality that, you know, that comes into play, which is very hard to add up. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1037.0s)]
*  And, you know, through some of the reporting, our reporting, other reporting, we've begun to be able to piece together some of the other aspects of this. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1046.0s)]
*  You know, Steve, what really strikes me about this is you kind of can't begrudge somebody for being able to have, what is this, you know, special tickets to suites for the Cowboys. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1053.0s)]
*  I mean, he's friends with Jerry Jones, who's a member of the organization. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1064.0s)]
*  He's also, he was friends with Wayne Heisinger, who was a Dolphins fan. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1067.0s)]
*  I mean, let's put aside the fact that Clarence Thomas says he's a Cowboys and a Dolphins fan at the same time, which kind of blows my mind in of itself. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1070.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't begrudge somebody from being able to rub elbows and to be able to be a part of this particular rarefied air. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1078.0s)]
*  But in and of itself, the fact that he has access to bend ears, but vice versa, that these people have the ability to bend his ear, that's truly the issue here. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1083.0s)]
*  So do you think it comes to the point where we've talked about reforms, we've talked about SCOTUS, we've talked about making it better, tighter and more ethical? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1095.0s)]
*  Do you think that's exactly why this type of piece you've written is necessary for the American public to know? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's about transparency and disclosure, and that's kind of at the root of just sort of what we're doing as journalists. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1109.0s)]
*  You know, but this is a case, too, where, you know, one of our big takeaways is looking at the access that Justice Thomas gave this organization, not just to the Supreme Court, but to the courtroom itself to hold their annual inauguration of these members, this very solemn ceremony that's kind of at the heart of this. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1115.0s)]
*  So there's a lot that goes into this and a lot to consider, you know, to think about the different ramifications and, you know, disclosures and transparency around it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1132.0s)]
*  Steve Eder, I appreciate you being here and for giving us this blockbuster reporting. It's really good. Thanks for being here. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1141.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1147.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucit6L0z0hs&t=1162.0s)]
