Video Description: As the CDC is tracking mutations in the bird flu virus that may make it easier for the infection to be spread from person to person, we are on the verge of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation hearings to lead the Department of Health and Human Services – with his known anti-vaccine beliefs. Asawin Suebsaeng and Brandy Zadrozny join Jason Johnson to discuss what this may mean for the well-being of Americans in the second Trump administration.

# The health risks of a second Trump administration
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw)
*  As we don't have enough to worry about during this cold flu COVID season, there's worrying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=0.0s)]
*  news about bird flu. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=6.04s)]
*  CDC says the virus now shows new mutations that may make it easier for the infection [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=7.8s)]
*  to be spread from person to person. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=13.42s)]
*  And that increases the risk of a wider outbreak of bird flu or even potentially a pandemic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=15.6s)]
*  The concerns over bird flu are rising just as we are on the verge of Senate confirmation [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=22.84s)]
*  hearings for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services, which could [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=27.2s)]
*  begin in the first or second week of January. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=31.68s)]
*  Kennedy's anti-vaccine stances are well known and deeply troubling for someone who would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=36.12s)]
*  run the federal agency responsible for protecting the health and well-being of all people living [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=40.4s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=46.08s)]
*  But it's not just Kennedy who is a concern. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=47.76s)]
*  It's the people he would bring on board with him, like a raw milk producer in California, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=50.2s)]
*  whose products have been recalled due to bird flu contamination. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=55.2s)]
*  This guy says Kennedy's team has asked him to lead the nation's policy on raw milk. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Oswin Soob Sang is a senior political reporter for Rolling Stone, where he is covering the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=65.28s)]
*  Trump transition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  And Brandy Zdrosny is a senior reporter for NBC News, who has written numerous stories [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  on R.F.K. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=76.66s)]
*  Jr. and the anti-vaccine movement. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=77.66s)]
*  They join me now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=79.56s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining me tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=80.56s)]
*  Brandy, I'll start with you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  It's very easy to just say, all right, R.F.K. is a kook who left a dead bear at a park and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=85.72s)]
*  did all sorts of things and doesn't like vaccines. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=92.52s)]
*  But I think it's always important for the public to be reminded, how big is the agency [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=95.28s)]
*  he is about to run? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=100.96s)]
*  What is the significance and the power that he will have in the agency he's going to run [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=102.24s)]
*  this new administration? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  Brandy Zdrosny Well, sure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  I mean, a former head of the HHS that he is now about to face confirmation hearings for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  called it a striking, a shocking amount of power with the stroke of a pen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  This is a huge organization rivaled only by defense. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=124.76s)]
*  And it is in charge of everything. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=128.4s)]
*  It is in charge of what we eat, the medicines we take, how we respond to outbreaks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=132.0s)]
*  It is responsible for the health of our babies and baby formula. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's everything. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=144.56s)]
*  It's every single thing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=146.56s)]
*  And if we don't have our health, we have nothing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=148.12s)]
*  And the idea, you said some of his greatest hits were, yes, the bear. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  But like in that example, a bear was killed not by Kennedy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=155.16s)]
*  And, you know, that's who cares about that, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  I care very much because the people that I talk to care very much about what he will [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  do specifically with vaccines. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=169.52s)]
*  That is the number one fear, because right now that affects our children, that affects [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=171.68s)]
*  babies all over the world. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=176.68s)]
*  And we have seen what happens when RFK gets involved with children's vaccines. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  We saw it in Samoa in 2019. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  Babies die. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=185.4s)]
*  If you if you engender mistrust in vaccines, which is what he will do because he will immediately [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=187.0s)]
*  start safety testing them, which basically means crunching the numbers we already have [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=193.16s)]
*  until his guys come back with the numbers that prove the point that he's been trying [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=197.44s)]
*  to make for decades. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  It's very, very dangerous stuff. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=204.12s)]
*  And it can't be stated. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=206.0s)]
*  It can't be overstated how dangerous this person is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=207.84s)]
*  So, Swin, I'm looking down the list of potential people who will be joining and working under [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=211.96s)]
*  RFK Jr. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=218.52s)]
*  We've got this guy, Dr. Martin McCarrie, who might be heading the FDA. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  He was also a covid vaccine skeptic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=223.56s)]
*  He's involved with some sort of weight loss diets one way or another. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=226.56s)]
*  And yet he's faculty out of Hopkins. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=230.64s)]
*  So my question for you is some of these people actually have certified, certified, certified [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=233.32s)]
*  and respected medical experience or scientific experience, but they're still considered [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  extremists. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=247.12s)]
*  What kind of problems could that create in running organizations like the FDA or the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=248.88s)]
*  HHS? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=253.84s)]
*  Well, you'll run into some problems that you have seen during the tumult and the scandalous [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=254.84s)]
*  periods of which, of course, there were so many of Donald Trump's first four years in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=262.24s)]
*  office when a lot of the people he brought in with him who had some, dare I say, freakish [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=266.56s)]
*  policy prescriptions, no pun intended, were oftentimes backed up by a bevy of credentials [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=272.88s)]
*  that by no means did not make anything that they were pitching a less extreme. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=282.0s)]
*  And something that President-elect Trump has been following through on so far during this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=286.0s)]
*  transition period, which isn't even over yet, is that he ran on a platform that signaled heavily [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=291.12s)]
*  that his administration, whether it was the Department of Defense, HHS, the White House, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=297.6s)]
*  anything else, would be packed to the hilt by people who believed in his worldview, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  which is dominated by more than anything else, a sense of rabid conspiracy theory. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=307.76s)]
*  And even though Donald Trump is the guy who likes to boast from time to time that he was behind [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=312.56s)]
*  Operation Warp Speed and things like that, there is no question that for years, starting early on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=317.2s)]
*  in his post-presidency, he has been cuddling up heavily to the incredibly dangerous and deadly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=322.4s)]
*  anti-vaccine movement. I reported back in 2021 that there were close confidants of his, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=329.36s)]
*  including veterans, senior veterans of his first administration, who came to him, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=336.96s)]
*  begging him to spearhead and star in, along with Melania Trump, a pro-vaccine campaign when the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=341.44s)]
*  Biden administration was starting to roll out heavily the initial versions of the coronavirus [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=348.32s)]
*  vaccines. He steadfastly refused time and time again. And it was very clear to people around him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=353.04s)]
*  that the reason he was doing that was because he didn't want to tick off the anti-vaccine movement, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=358.48s)]
*  which nowadays skews heavily, heavily pro-Trump and Republican. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=363.68s)]
*  And going back to something Brandi was saying earlier about just to hammer home the point, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=368.72s)]
*  and not that she needs me to hammer home the point, because she made it beautifully, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=373.36s)]
*  and not her fault, but grotesquely earlier, that children die when these things come into positions [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=377.44000000000005s)]
*  of federal influence. Scott Gottlieb, who was the FDA commissioner during the first Trump [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=384.8s)]
*  administration, he's not considered a squoosh, like a John Kelly or someone like that, who likes [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  to go out there and talk about how fascistic they think Donald Trump is. He has publicly said that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=396.32s)]
*  RFK Jr. gets in there and follows through with the policy prescriptions that he's been trotting out [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=401.04s)]
*  there. People will die. I know we're all immunized almost to a lot of the insanity coming out of this [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=406.08s)]
*  transition. But I do not remember the last time a veteran of someone's administration came out to say, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=412.64s)]
*  oh, yeah, if you do this thing that you're planning for, yeah, yeah, my former boss and his [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=418.08s)]
*  minions are going to end up killing me. Brandi, I want to follow up with this, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=423.36s)]
*  because I think this is really key. When we start talking about conspiracy theorists, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=428.16s)]
*  when we talk about people who are in charge of vast administrations, I think about the science. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=431.92s)]
*  I think about the amount of research money that is no longer going to be put into prominent [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=437.12s)]
*  universities, into breakthrough areas in science that we need to study diseases because of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  ideological beliefs of these people. Talk to us just a little bit about what could happen [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=448.16s)]
*  with funding. What could happen in funding to disease prevention and things like that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=452.72s)]
*  if you have people who believe in herd immunity or don't believe in the value of vaccines? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  How could that impact the United States down the road? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=462.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the best case scenario is that a bunch of cranks, much like we had when smoking was [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=467.04s)]
*  not necessary, when smoking was still sort of debated in the public sphere. You had people [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=476.24s)]
*  from real universities, you had people who were real EMDs, real scientists who were contrarians, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=483.6s)]
*  who were cozying up with the tobacco industry. In climate science, you have 99, 99.7 percent of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=489.6s)]
*  people agree that the planet is warming. But then you have that little group of contrarians that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=499.28s)]
*  will say, no, it's not. And what we're doing right now is we're seemingly going to fill HHS and CDC [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  and FDA and down the line with these tiny groups of conspiracy theorists and contrarians that have, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=512.88s)]
*  some that have fancy titles and Johns Hopkins and Stanford by their name. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=522.72s)]
*  And so the danger in that could be terrible. It could be a bunch of cranks pointing to things [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=527.68s)]
*  in the sky that don't exist and giving money to things that don't matter. But like you said, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=533.04s)]
*  like the thing that's worrisome is that our money goes to lots of places, very specific places. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  Like the FDA is currently focused on they have to make sure that baby formula is safe. Right. And [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=545.3599999999999s)]
*  what happens when we can't do that? We have a baby formula shortage. Vaccines don't just go out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Qi_hP_Gw&t=551.04s)]
