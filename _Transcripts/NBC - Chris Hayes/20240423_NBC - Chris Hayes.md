# ‘He has a whole lot to say’ Tabloid boss takes stand at Trump hush money trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII)
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent who's been watching from inside the courtroom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=0.0s)]
*  Andrew Rice also in the courtroom today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=4.88s)]
*  He's a writer at New York Magazine where he just profiled Trump's defense attorney, Todd [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=6.68s)]
*  Blanch, in a new cover story. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=9.8s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=11.48s)]
*  Great to have you both here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=12.48s)]
*  Let me just start top-line impressions from the day to day, Lisa. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=13.48s)]
*  I think my top-line impression is that David Pecker has a whole lot to say. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that he said at the very beginning was he was asked how often he communicated [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=21.36s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  He said after Trump became a candidate, their conversations increased, not decreased. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=26.24s)]
*  You would expect a presidential candidate would get so busy that they wouldn't really [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  have time for their old friend David Pecker. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=34.04s)]
*  And yet, they still found time to meet once a month, talked on the phone roughly once [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=36.2s)]
*  a week and sometimes more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=41.92s)]
*  We heard about two of those conversations today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=43.82s)]
*  Book ended sort of the beginning and the end of the testimony, that August 2015 meeting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  that you talked about, and that phone call during 2016 about Karen McDougal having been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=50.16s)]
*  vetted and what Trump wanted to know about that conversation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  I have to assume there are a lot more conversations that David Pecker had directly with Donald [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=59.48s)]
*  Trump and that the prosecution is going to elicit testimony about them in the ensuing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  days. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=68.16s)]
*  Andrew, what did you think? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=69.16s)]
*  I mean, I thought the most relevant thing to watch was actually sort of the ongoing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=70.16s)]
*  dichotomy between what's going on inside the courtroom and what's happening outside the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=75.4s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=79.4s)]
*  And I think that it came into relief really when at the beginning of the day when there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=80.4s)]
*  was a hearing about whether Donald Trump was going to be held in contempt for some of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  things that he had said on Truth Social about witnesses, even about a juror. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  And Todd Blanch, the guy that I profiled in the story, got up and said that our client [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=95.84s)]
*  has a right to talk about the two systems of justice that are being shown here in this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is something that we're going to see a lot, which is basically Donald Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  is not if he can win an acquittal or if he can win a mistrial, that's great for him, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=111.44s)]
*  but he's running against the system. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=116.72s)]
*  Well, OK, let me a follow up on that, because Blanch also at one point says to Mershan, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=118.44s)]
*  and we're going to talk about this in a second and more in greater detail, he says like he's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=122.64s)]
*  doing his best or something or like we're trying our best. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=125.8s)]
*  And that's when Mershan says like, you're losing credibility. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=128.38s)]
*  Like, come on, buddy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=131.04s)]
*  What is Blanch's angle here? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=132.5s)]
*  If it is the case that your understanding of Trump's approach to this is not primarily [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=134.6s)]
*  is legal, that it's primarily about the sort of making this broader case in the court of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=140.32s)]
*  public opinion, is Blanch on board with that strategy? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=144.52s)]
*  Well, I think that Blanch is ultimately trying to and they've made it very clear they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=148.88s)]
*  hoping to find a juror, one juror really, who will hold out and won't vote to convict [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=155.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. And they're hoping for a mistrial. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=161.32s)]
*  And if there is a mistrial, of course, Donald Trump will go out on the courtrooms, courthouse [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=164.48s)]
*  steps and say, I've been completely exonerated, even here in New York. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=169.12s)]
*  And and and so that's that's their strategy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=173.4s)]
*  Ultimately, the back and forth with the judge, which is happening outside of the presence [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=177.48s)]
*  of the jury, has not bled into the trial too much. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=181.76s)]
*  But it's going to be an interesting dynamic to watch. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=186.32s)]
*  Yeah, in terms of this, you know, the the pecker testimony and the notion of like a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  mistrial and one of the things that just going back to the transcripts is just sort of striking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  me again. And maybe this is such an obvious point, but just indulge me for a second is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=198.6s)]
*  like, you know, sometimes you'll have like in a classic sort of mystery courtroom drama, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=202.0s)]
*  there's a question of like, was it that person driving the car? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  Did this actually happen? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=209.88s)]
*  In this case, it's like it's clear as day all this stuff happened. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=211.32s)]
*  It's clear as day like, is there any real doubt that David Pecker met with Michael [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=215.52s)]
*  Cohen and Donald Trump that they set up the catcher? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=220.08s)]
*  I mean, I guess you could think that Pecker's lying and that Michael Cohen's lying and that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=222.56s)]
*  all the but the basics of the story that's being presented here just seem to me pretty [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  much bedrock solid. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  But let me push back on that a little. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that one of the things that the prosecution has to establish and was surprising to many [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  people in the courtroom is the extent of Donald Trump's own involvement here, which, of course, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=238.84s)]
*  as the bar here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=243.12s)]
*  Yes, which is necessary not only contextually, but to prove the crime. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=244.12s)]
*  The other thing is we all know about what I'll call the antecedent story, the setup [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=248.4s)]
*  of the hush money payments. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=253.28s)]
*  The thing that the prosecutors have to really prove, though, to show falsification of business [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=255.12s)]
*  records as a felony is that there was a cover up with the intent to commit or conceal a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=259.32s)]
*  crime and tying Donald Trump expressly to that, I think is something that none of us [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  have really seen their evidence about yet. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=270.44s)]
*  And we're all looking for it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Totally. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=276.12s)]
*  But I guess my point is that on this part of it, right, which is not the criminal part, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=277.12s)]
*  it's just like, did this arrangement happen? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=280.2s)]
*  It just seems clear that it did happen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=282.92s)]
*  I mean, again, I'm not in the jury, but just from the reporting we have from the testimony [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=284.48s)]
*  from and I also wonder also because I can't quite get it from the transcript from the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  transcript. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Pecker seems pretty comfortable and forthcoming as a witness. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  I thought that it was, you know, maybe maybe I'm naive, but I but I thought it was pretty [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=298.12s)]
*  shocking to hear him talk with such total frankness. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=303.12s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=307.2s)]
*  That's how it comes on nature of the of the relationship that he had with Donald Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=308.2s)]
*  And he actually quite candidly said on the stand that this was not normal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=313.32s)]
*  This wasn't this what even by the standards of the National Enquirer, these transactions [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  were not normal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=321.84s)]
*  They had a very special relationship with Donald Trump that they had forged and they [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=322.84s)]
*  wanted to see Donald Trump elected president and they were acting sort of as an adjunct [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=329.44s)]
*  arm of the campaign. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  And that I mean, this is has nothing to do with the criminal trial per se, but just as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  disclosures go. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  The part about the seeding negative stories like he would just send us stuff and we like [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  that is shocking and would be in any other league media enterprise. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=347.92s)]
*  An unbelievable scandal and also gives you a little sense of how Donald Trump projects [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=352.6s)]
*  his view of the media like his view of the media being like they all function like that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=357.0s)]
*  because that's what the Enquirer did for me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=362.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think the other thing that sort of was lost until today is what is David Pecker [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  getting out of this and in complimenting and praising Donald Trump, that's what made his [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  testimony so damning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=373.72s)]
*  He said he was the top celebrity among Enquirer readers, that he was knowledgeable about his [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=374.72s)]
*  business, that he was detail oriented, micromanagerial. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  All the things that he said about Donald Trump that were complimentary are eventually going [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=384.48s)]
*  to be his doom as Pecker tells his story. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  And also there's a little bit of a time machine thing about going back to The Apprentice as [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=392.5s)]
*  a hit show and like I'm trying to sell magazines, man, and this guy's got a big show and he [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  moves product. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  We need to be close to him. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  Lisa Rubin and Andrew Rice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  That was great. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=404.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGsBENKOII&t=405.4s)]
