# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Sept. 8
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg)
*  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=0.0s)]
*  He doesn't represent my party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=5.32s)]
*  He doesn't represent the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=7.2s)]
*  for. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=11.32s)]
*  And you know how you make America great again? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=12.32s)]
*  Tell Donald Trump to go to hell. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=14.44s)]
*  I've seen that clip like a thousand times. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=17.36s)]
*  I'm exaggerating. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=19.68s)]
*  50 times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=20.68s)]
*  Still really wild, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=22.16s)]
*  Back in 2015, then presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, not a big fan of Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  At one point, Trump infamously retaliated by sharing Graham's private phone number at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  a rally, which in turn led to Graham making a big show of destroying his phone to end [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=31.88s)]
*  the harassment from angry Trump fans and admittedly is a bit of a publicity stunt. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  Just a few years later, Graham was firmly on Team Trump, going so far as to assist the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  ex-president in his attempted coup by pressuring Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=46.3s)]
*  Raffensperger into overturning Biden's victory in the state, or at least maybe tossing out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=50.64s)]
*  some absentee ballots he thought might help Trump get the win. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=55.14s)]
*  It was that endeavor, of course, which led to a Georgia special grand jury recommending [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=59.54s)]
*  Graham be indicted in Fulton County, something that ultimately did not happen, likely due [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=63.86s)]
*  in large part to the logistical hurdles of indicting a sitting senator in state court. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=68.14s)]
*  Directly after the January 6 attack when Trump's mob stormed Graham's place of work, he, like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=74.7s)]
*  many others, claimed he was done. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=78.62s)]
*  But it didn't take too long before he was back on the Trump train. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  All I can say is count me out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=85.14s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=88.74s)]
*  I've tried to be helpful. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=90.42s)]
*  I'm for Donald Trump because I know what I'm going to get. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=92.1s)]
*  We need somebody that on day one can get this country back on track. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=95.22s)]
*  So what exactly happened? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=100.38s)]
*  How did Lindsey Graham go from hardline never Trumper to risking criminal exposure for the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=101.38s)]
*  ex-president, briefly back to being a never Trumper before endorsing him for a third campaign? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=106.58s)]
*  Daniel Saladin is a writer for the Bullwork who has spent a year going through Lindsey [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=112.5s)]
*  Graham's archive of public statements. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=116.26s)]
*  The end result was a book length story called The Corruption of Lindsey Graham, and he joins [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=118.66s)]
*  me now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=122.94s)]
*  Well, I've been enjoying your case study. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=123.94s)]
*  And first, let's just start with the news out of the Fulton County grand jury. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=127.58s)]
*  I mean, again, he was not actually charged, but he did make these calls. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=132.14s)]
*  And what's striking about them is it wasn't like one of these things where you get cornered [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=137.34s)]
*  by a microphone and you kind of have to say the line, you know, is the toe of the Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=141.7s)]
*  line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  This was done behind the scenes, affirmatively of his own volition and enterprise. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  This wasn't like he was pandering. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=152.5s)]
*  And that to me really sticks out about what it says about him and his character. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=155.82s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=159.7s)]
*  Well, from the beginning of right after the election, Lindsey Graham was engaged in a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  very public campaign to help Donald Trump try to overturn the results. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=166.1s)]
*  He was obviously spreading. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=171.1s)]
*  Graham was all over Fox News. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=173.22s)]
*  He was spreading myths and lies about about election fraud. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=174.78s)]
*  And this call to Raffensperger was part of a campaign. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=178.5s)]
*  Trump wanted all of his accomplices, including Graham, to be doing everything they could [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=181.78s)]
*  to try to help him overturn these state results in the key states. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=185.98s)]
*  And this this call to Raffensperger was Graham's version of the phone call that Trump later [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=190.26s)]
*  made to Raffensperger. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  And Trump's phone call is very explicit, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=198.54s)]
*  He says, I need you to find me 11,780 votes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=201.14s)]
*  Graham appears to have done a much who it Graham is a trained lawyer and a smarter guy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=204.7s)]
*  And he appears to have done a much smarter version of the call in which he didn't say [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  go find me the votes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=214.18s)]
*  He said, you know, Brad, what could you do about these counties where there were a lot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=215.64s)]
*  of mail in ballots? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=220.38s)]
*  We don't know whether the signatures were valid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=221.38s)]
*  We can't prove they aren't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=223.48s)]
*  But, you know, is there something you could do where you could just sort of set those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=224.48s)]
*  ballots, all the ballots, the mail in ballots from those counties aside? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  So he was doing a clever version of what Trump was doing to try to undermine the result. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=231.26s)]
*  And he managed to do it, obviously, in a way where Trump gets indicted, but Graham doesn't. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=235.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=240.78s)]
*  And let's be clear here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=241.78s)]
*  When he's saying that, can you set the mail in ballots? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=242.78s)]
*  We've got to go back to 2020, an election where we knew that the mail in ballots were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=244.66s)]
*  running, you know, 80, 20 or whatever they were hugely for Biden, the in-person vote [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=248.94s)]
*  going the opposite way. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=253.54s)]
*  Like, the categories of votes were proxies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=254.54s)]
*  You know what you're doing if you're asking someone to set aside mail in ballots. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=258.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  And the dispute here is, did he actually ask Raffensperger to set them aside, or did he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=264.06s)]
*  just say sort of, you know, is this a legal thing that one could do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=269.24s)]
*  Because Trump is very explicit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=273.58s)]
*  You can hear in Trump's phone call, I need you to do this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=275.36s)]
*  Graham, if he doesn't express it as an imperative, does he get away with it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=278.58s)]
*  And the answer is, with seven of the special grand jurors, apparently, that was enough. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=282.76s)]
*  And that was enough to deter Fannie Willis from proceeding with the Graham part of the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=287.48s)]
*  indictment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=291.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny, when I talk to people in the world, not on television about politics, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=292.0s)]
*  there's a bunch of questions people ask. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=296.52s)]
*  You know, one of them that comes up with some frequency is like, what's the deal with Lindsey [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=297.8s)]
*  Graham? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=300.96s)]
*  Like, it's a fairly, like, people are like, what? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=301.96s)]
*  Like, I don't get it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=304.2s)]
*  What was he pretending then? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=305.76s)]
*  Is he pretending now? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=306.84s)]
*  What's your theory, having basically written a book about this, of the answer to that question? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=314.28s)]
*  The simple answer is, there isn't a moment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=315.28s)]
*  There isn't some, you know, a lot of people you've heard say, oh, Trump blackmailed him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=318.76s)]
*  There was some golf outing where Trump, you know, told Graham he was going to spill some [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  dark secret about Graham, and then Graham came over. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  That's not what happened. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=328.96s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=330.2s)]
*  What happened is a long, slow process. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=331.76s)]
*  Remember, in the clips you played in 2015, Graham was trying to stop Trump from becoming [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=334.44s)]
*  the Republican nominee and from gaining power. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=339.84s)]
*  Once Trump got the Republican nomination, Graham started to coach him on how to win [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=342.68s)]
*  the election. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=347.08s)]
*  And then once Trump won the election and was going to be president, Graham wanted to influence [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=348.18s)]
*  policy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=353.24s)]
*  And Graham does believe in an internationalist interventionist foreign policy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=354.24s)]
*  So he wanted to have influence in Trump's White House. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=358.58s)]
*  And he gradually just began to rationalize everything Trump did. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=361.72s)]
*  You know, Chris, it was Trump's initiative, not Graham's. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump did things like firing Jim Comey. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=368.44000000000005s)]
*  And those are the things that Graham increasingly rationalized, one after another after another, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=371.36s)]
*  so that Graham could have access to Trump's ear. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=376.6s)]
*  Even today, you can see when Graham is on TV, those interviews he's doing on Fox, they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=381.12s)]
*  not for you and me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=385.48s)]
*  Those are for Donald Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=386.94000000000005s)]
*  They're for the guy that he wants Trump to believe that if Trump gets back in power, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=388.56s)]
*  Trump should call Lindsey Graham, bring him back into the White House, and for him to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=393.4s)]
*  be the voice, the counselor on foreign policy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=397.24s)]
*  This is a really good case study in a certain kind of corruption, deep, not corruption in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=400.32s)]
*  the sense of like bribery, but it's like the deep, deep sense of corruption of one's soul, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=405.24s)]
*  Will Saliton. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=409.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=410.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=411.8s)]
*  This movement is the humanitarian movement of our time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=418.56s)]
*  This strong pro-life, pro-family position attracted millions of voters, the Reagan Democrats, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=423.88s)]
*  independents, and previous non-voters. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=429.36s)]
*  I'm a proud pro-life candidate. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=431.4s)]
*  I'm a pro-life president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=432.92s)]
*  The most pro-life president in American history. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=434.4s)]
*  Republicans have spent over 30 years calling themselves pro-life, and it seemed to work [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=441.2s)]
*  because who's against life? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=444.68s)]
*  So they have been coached for decades to respond to any question about abortion with, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=447.38s)]
*  well, I'm pro-life and I make no apologies for it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=451.38s)]
*  But since the Dobs ruling, when questions include, do you think this woman should have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=454.58s)]
*  been left in a hospital parking lot to get sepsis before she got treatment, that rote [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=458.06s)]
*  answer, well, I'm pro-life, may not work as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=463.74s)]
*  So now as NBC News is reporting, Republicans are looking to move away from the term pro-life [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=467.54s)]
*  to stave off more election losses. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=471.54s)]
*  At a meeting this week, Senate Republicans were presented with poll results that suggested [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=474.14s)]
*  voters reacting differently to commonly used terms like pro-life and pro-choice in the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=478.41999999999996s)]
*  wake of last year's Supreme Court decision. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=482.46s)]
*  Many voters think pro-life means you're for no exceptions in favor of abortion ever, ever, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=485.18s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley said about the poll. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=490.14s)]
*  And Senator Ted Young of Indiana says the meeting of Republican senators was about, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=492.46s)]
*  get this, pro-baby policies. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=496.32s)]
*  Asked whether pro-baby was going to be the new pro-life, Young said pro-baby was, quote, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=499.41999999999996s)]
*  just a turn of my creation to demonstrate my concern for babies. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=503.86s)]
*  Erin Carmona is a senior correspondent for New York Magazine covering gender, politics, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  and law, and she joins me now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=512.82s)]
*  I want to start, Erin, as I was reading the story today, it strikes me that in the annals [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=515.02s)]
*  of political messaging, certainly in my lifetime and even longer, pro-life is like up there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=520.6s)]
*  in the top five, like maybe with senior citizen, which is another just totally incredible term. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=525.34s)]
*  Pro-life is an incredibly effective way of coining your message, and it has been, and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=531.92s)]
*  they have thought that for decades. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=537.64s)]
*  They have used it and the word life as a kind of siren call very effectively. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=541.76s)]
*  So much so, Chris, that actually people who supported abortion rights would tell pollsters [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=550.78s)]
*  that they were pro-life. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=555.0s)]
*  As you said, who's against life? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=556.0s)]
*  Pro-choice, by contrast, never satisfied anybody in the movement that supports abortion rights [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  because it was wishy-washy and kind of libertarian. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=563.76s)]
*  But as you well know, Republicans don't have a messaging problem. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=566.88s)]
*  They have a woman getting sexist problem. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=570.76s)]
*  They have a teenager or preteen being forced to carry to term problem. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=573.4s)]
*  They have a problem that the Alabama attorney general says he will prosecute people who [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=578.04s)]
*  try to help people cross state lines to get an abortion. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=582.0s)]
*  No language change in the world can occlude the reality of what these policies actually [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=584.98s)]
*  mean beyond the rhetoric. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=590.14s)]
*  That is extremely well said, and I think there's also part of it, too, that's almost deeper [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=592.54s)]
*  than rhetoric, which is conceptual. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=596.94s)]
*  The point is that you're saying this is a human life, and it has to be treated like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=600.46s)]
*  a human life, the six-week fetus. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=604.78s)]
*  That has implications, moral implications, legal implications that they don't want to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=607.1s)]
*  face, but are the actual implications of the thing that they're saying. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=613.3399999999999s)]
*  Look, even the alternative stretches conceptual reality, pro-baby, pro-life, I mean, pro-throwing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=617.14s)]
*  people off Medicaid or never extending it to them in the first place, pro-again, forcing [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=624.74s)]
*  people to give birth to fetuses or babies that will never be able to take more than [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=630.9s)]
*  a couple breaths and live in pain. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=636.26s)]
*  I think when we see even the paltry policy solutions, it's nice to see something, but [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=639.3s)]
*  even this is kind of a weak scaffolding in the face of very hostile environments for [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=644.3s)]
*  low-income parents. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=648.98s)]
*  I think even what they are suggesting is an alternative pro-baby, pro-mother. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=650.58s)]
*  Anybody reading the news, I mean, voters are not stupid. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=656.1s)]
*  We see again and again in referenda, in proxy elections that concern this issue, that voters [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=658.9s)]
*  actually really understand what is happening here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=664.9399999999999s)]
*  So the attempt to kind of change the subject is not effective so far. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=668.14s)]
*  And honestly, if the reality weren't so hideous, them backing away from pro-life would actually [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=672.58s)]
*  be kind of funny. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=677.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I take some humor in it because I have watched them use this for so long. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  This is all about politics, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=686.1s)]
*  So this is some of the quotes from the Wall Street Journal story. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=687.66s)]
*  This is a head of a nonprofit align with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=692.34s)]
*  The suburbs have been the killing field for Republican candidates the last few election [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=695.58s)]
*  cycles. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=699.98s)]
*  And in the group's poll, 71% of suburban women said they were somewhat or strongly opposed [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=701.82s)]
*  to this pre-pornistism. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  So they have a substance problem. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=707.0200000000001s)]
*  They don't have a messaging problem. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=709.0200000000001s)]
*  Here's how I think they understand it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  And I want to give it to you and see what you think. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=712.6600000000001s)]
*  I think they think that the extremes are what's killing them politically. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=716.0600000000001s)]
*  The story of the woman who has to get sepsis in the parking lot. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=721.2s)]
*  The story of the Texas woman who is forced to give birth and forced to carry to term [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=724.58s)]
*  a non-viable fetus. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=730.38s)]
*  The woman in Florida who had to hold this baby who took two breaths before it died that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=733.7s)]
*  her father-in-law called state sanctioned torture. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=739.0200000000001s)]
*  They're like, if we can get rid of that, maybe we put some exceptions in and we got a consensus [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=742.5400000000001s)]
*  at 12 weeks, we're going to be good. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=748.0200000000001s)]
*  That's what they think and that's what they're going to try to message on. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=749.7800000000001s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=752.24s)]
*  I don't agree that they even want to engage that much. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=754.06s)]
*  What they are actually saying is that they want to go back to the old tried and true [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=757.54s)]
*  of focusing on later abortions. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=761.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=762.66s)]
*  You actually hear a lot of those same Republicans saying, wait, we actually what we need is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=763.66s)]
*  a 15 week ban, which Rhonda Santis did before he did obviously a six week ban. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=766.78s)]
*  I actually don't even see them engaging those horrific cases except to say that it's somehow [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=772.26s)]
*  the doctor's fault or the pro-choice movement's fault. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=776.54s)]
*  They want to change the subject to exceptions, which we can see in ample reporting do not [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=779.74s)]
*  exist even when they exist on paper. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=785.86s)]
*  It's almost impossible to find a legal or a medical outlet for these exceptions. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=787.98s)]
*  And they just want to go back to saying that it's Democrats who are extreme. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=793.1400000000001s)]
*  And that's why you're also seeing people at least rhetorically, not so much with their [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  votes on the national level, but saying, OK, everybody should be supporting a 15 week ban. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe that that was the Senate Republican Campaign Committee position. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=804.98s)]
*  Now, I think it was Alabama's Robin Marty who first pointed out that when they're talking [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=809.14s)]
*  about a national 15 week ban, they're not talking about, for example, abortion being [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=812.9s)]
*  legal in Alabama for the first 15 weeks. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=820.14s)]
*  They're talking about curtailing the rights of people in states like New York, California, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=821.14s)]
*  Colorado, who have made it very clear that they want abortion. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9kH-sRANg&t=824.38s)]
