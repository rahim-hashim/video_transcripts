Video Description: “There’s no one consistent ask here. There’s no one thing Scalise needs to do. A lot of these members are beholden to a very conservative base that wants them to essentially do magic: to make a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president accept very conservative bills," says Sahil Kapur on the GOP lawmakers saying they won't back Steve Scalise for speaker.

# 'Republican dysfunction': Scalise faces GOP holdouts after speaker nomination
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY)
*  The House of Representatives briefly gaveled into session today, but is still unable to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=0.0s)]
*  take any meaningful action on the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=4.32s)]
*  And that's because House Republicans still have not chosen a new Speaker of the House [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  more than a week after they fired the last guy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=12.32s)]
*  Honestly, they're not any closer a resolution than they were a week ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=15.08s)]
*  Today in a closed-door secret ballot vote, the House Republican Conference chose Louisiana [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=19.12s)]
*  Congressman Steve Scalise as their next boss. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=23.8s)]
*  Scalise beat Donald Trump's hand-picked choice, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, 113 to 99. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=26.76s)]
*  But if you thought that was the end of the protracted fight for the Speaker's gavel, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=32.56s)]
*  you have not met the current House Republican majority. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=35.84s)]
*  You see, there was supposed to be a formal vote to elevate Scalise to the Speakership [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=38.04s)]
*  about six hours ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=42.32s)]
*  That didn't happen because it turns out he still doesn't have the votes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=43.84s)]
*  Even though Jim Jordan, the guy who's running against, and Matt Gaetz, the guy who led the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  drive to fire McCarthy in the first place, both back him in a perfect encapsulation of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=51.56s)]
*  Republican dysfunction. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=56.64s)]
*  We heard from two different House members who refused to vote for him today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=57.64s)]
*  Chip Roy of Texas, who thinks Scalise is too close to the establishment, and Nancy Mace [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=60.92s)]
*  of South Carolina, who once proudly touted Scalise's endorsement just a couple of years [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=66.16s)]
*  ago and now claims he's too extreme. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=71.64s)]
*  Are you worried about Scalise having been McCarthy's number two? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't kind of view it through those lens. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=80.04s)]
*  I will say that going down the road to the status quo is not my pro-option. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=82.4s)]
*  I personally cannot in good conscience vote for someone who attended a white supremacist [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=87.08s)]
*  conference and compared himself to David Duke. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Michael Steele is a former chairman of the RNC, Sahil Kapoor is national political reporter [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=97.16s)]
*  for NBC News. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=101.12s)]
*  His latest piece is titled, Scalise brings a fresh face but a similar policy vision as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=102.12s)]
*  McCarthy, Republicans say. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=106.32s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=108.64s)]
*  Sahil, let's just talk about what went down today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=109.92s)]
*  You've got a vote behind closed doors. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=112.44s)]
*  How does that vote work? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=115.56s)]
*  I think it's a secret ballot vote, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=116.68s)]
*  That's right, Chris. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=120.0s)]
*  It is a secret ballot vote. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=121.0s)]
*  And Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, the natural successor to Kevin McCarthy, beat [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=122.24s)]
*  out Jim Jordan, the right wing firebrand, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=127.0s)]
*  at least in public endorsements heading into this contest seemed to have an edge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=131.46s)]
*  But Scalise, it turns out, had most of the silent members, the ones who don't go on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=136.28s)]
*  TV as much, who aren't as popular on conservative media, they preferred Scalise. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=140.24s)]
*  Still it was a narrow vote. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=144.4s)]
*  And now Scalise has got to figure out how to get to 217 votes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  He's got his own Rubik's Cube here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=148.96s)]
*  McCarthy had trouble corralling the majority of the Republican conference, or rather almost [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=151.52s)]
*  every member, as he needed to do every day to keep the job. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Scalise has got a different and equally challenging equation on his hands right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=158.88s)]
*  Yeah, Michael, one thing that is notable to me, we had this happen with Liz Cheney. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=163.76s)]
*  Liz Cheney, there was a secret ballot to expel her from leadership. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=168.6s)]
*  She won that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=172.84s)]
*  Then there was a recorded vote and she lost that after Donald Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=173.84s)]
*  And I just thought it was just, it's worth noting that Donald Trump threw his weight [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  behind Jim Jordan and endorsed him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=182.0s)]
*  And in a secret ballot, they did not go with Donald Trump's suggestion, which I think is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=184.56s)]
*  pretty interesting. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, it just tells you how afraid they are of Donald Trump and more importantly, his [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=191.72s)]
*  base, who obviously are not happy about this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=196.28s)]
*  Steve Scalise has more than a numbers problem, in my estimation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  He still has a policy problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=205.84s)]
*  He has a, do I partner with Joe Biden to, you know, pay the nation's bills problem? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  How do I help, you know, fight against Hamas and stand with Israel at the same time, try [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=215.52s)]
*  to ignore Ukraine problem? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=222.24s)]
*  So there are a lot of other aspects to this, to Sahil's great reporting over the last couple [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=224.88s)]
*  of weeks about how these narratives are starting to unfold. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=230.96s)]
*  The backstory drama, Chris, is not the who's ahead in the horse race for the speaker. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=235.0s)]
*  The question I hear from a lot of Republicans, what the hell do we do once we get the job? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=241.52s)]
*  Once he gets it back, you put a new leader in, what do we do? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=247.36s)]
*  Because the base has got them boxed in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, that gets to an important thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  One of the things in covering this story we've gone back and forth on is, is there an ask [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  here? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=259.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=260.68s)]
*  Is there a demonstrable ask? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=261.68s)]
*  And there sort of was and wasn't a defund Jack Smith. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=262.68s)]
*  Not going to happen, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=263.68s)]
*  One of them was, we don't like these continuing resolutions that fund the government. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=265.36s)]
*  We want to go through regular order appropriations process. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=270.24s)]
*  So that was a big one. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=272.04s)]
*  To the extent there was like a principled one. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=273.04s)]
*  We want these dramatic cuts that are below the level that were negotiated with Biden [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=274.36s)]
*  in the deal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=279.64s)]
*  Sahil, here's my question for you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=280.64s)]
*  My understanding is that Jordan and Scalise both came before the conference to be like, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=281.8s)]
*  yeah, we're going to have to sign a CR. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=285.64s)]
*  We're going to have to do a CR, continuing resolution. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=286.64s)]
*  So there's already this concession that the whole thing this was ostensibly about isn't [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=294.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Chris. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=295.04s)]
*  It is a jumble. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=296.52s)]
*  96 percent of the Republican conference, remember, supported Kevin McCarthy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  Among that 96 percent was Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  They both spoke out on the floor just a few feet away from where I'm standing right now, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  urging those eight rebels not to evict Kevin McCarthy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=308.56s)]
*  But they didn't listen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=312.32s)]
*  And now you've got a situation where Steve Scalise is, yes, he is, you know, winning [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=313.56s)]
*  over some of those rebels who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy, including Matt Gaetz, including [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=317.88s)]
*  Tim Burchett. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=323.44s)]
*  But he's got his own problems in other areas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=325.0s)]
*  There are some members who have flipped from a yes on McCarthy to a no on Scalise. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=327.0s)]
*  That includes Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=332.92s)]
*  They had made their peace with the McCarthy speakership. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=335.24s)]
*  They both said they're not ready to support Steve Scalise for speaker. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=337.12s)]
*  And then you have Nancy Mace and Bob Good, who were a no on McCarthy and are still a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=340.2s)]
*  no on Scalise. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=344.96s)]
*  There's no one consistent ask here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=345.96s)]
*  There's no one thing Scalise needs to do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=348.08s)]
*  A lot of these members are beholden to a very conservative base that wants them to essentially [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=350.08s)]
*  do magic to make a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president accept very conservative [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=354.6s)]
*  bills that a narrow Republican House might pass, which Democrats are simply never going [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=360.44s)]
*  to. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=365.16s)]
*  So, you know, how Scalise resolves that? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=366.16s)]
*  It's very unclear. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=367.88s)]
*  Most of the Republicans I spoke to today say he shares a governing vision, you know, the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=368.88s)]
*  same as McCarthy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=373.44s)]
*  They're not that different on policy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=374.44s)]
*  But the one area where he might have a leg up, Chris, is that he doesn't have the same [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  personality clashes and feuds with people like Matt Gaetz that Kevin McCarthy does. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=380.12s)]
*  That is, if anything, his ace in the hole right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=384.56s)]
*  Well, but here's the thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=387.08s)]
*  The other part of this, do you agree, there's no like actual consistent caucus here or even [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=388.44s)]
*  a governing project that unites everyone, which I think is actually the problem at the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=392.68s)]
*  heart of this, Michael. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=396.2s)]
*  You know, the narrow majority means that it's been demonstrated you can extract some concessions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=398.48s)]
*  or you can extract fundraising or you can extract TV hits or whatever it is at the margin. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=403.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=407.68s)]
*  So, when you've got Chip Roy and you've got Nancy Mace and Bob Good and who knows who [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=408.68s)]
*  else? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=411.52s)]
*  You know, there's a few others today. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=412.52s)]
*  I thought this was interesting from Ken Buck, whose emerge is a very interesting figure [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=415.16s)]
*  in this caucus. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=419.24s)]
*  He said he asked Jordan and Scalise yesterday the flat out question, basically, who won [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=420.82s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  And I want to play you what he had to say. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=429.72s)]
*  I asked last night, will you unequivocally and publicly state that the election, the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=430.72s)]
*  2020 presidential election was not stolen? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=436.68s)]
*  He didn't answer that question very clearly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=439.62s)]
*  And Jim Jordan didn't answer that question very clearly. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=441.72s)]
*  I thought that was pretty interesting. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=444.88s)]
*  That's an interview with my colleague, Katie Turra. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=445.88s)]
*  And I also think it's like a worthwhile exercise to do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=447.56s)]
*  I mean, if you're, you know, people are holding out for for the votes like good on you, Ken [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=450.32s)]
*  Buck, if that's what you can extract. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=455.12s)]
*  Well, it's not a question so much of extracting. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=456.76s)]
*  It's just a question of kind of putting in front of the body. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=460.6s)]
*  Look at what we're going to go out to the public with. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=465.44s)]
*  I mean, I can't even inside the room get you to say, yeah, it was it was stolen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=468.32s)]
*  No, it wasn't stolen. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  How what do you think the press is going to do when you get when you get out in public? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  What does the public say? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  You put your finger on a very important strain here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=482.23999999999995s)]
*  It's governing. The word governing is having not just having majority is having a majority [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=484.88s)]
*  that can govern. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=490.4s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you can be opposition all day long. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=491.52s)]
*  You can scream and shout at the rafters all day long. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=494.76s)]
*  But at some point, the nation's got to pay its bills. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=497.52s)]
*  At some point, the nation is going to need a budget to pay the bills for next year. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  At some point, your allies are going to say, hey, can you help a brother or a sister out? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=504.44s)]
*  Yes. You've got to be prepared to do that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes. And in fact, there's there's going to be a fairly pressing things moving on, I think, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  but probably most likely Israel and Ukraine, Sahel, which is going to ratchet up the pressure. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  Michael Falls has been has been saying that as well. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=523.16s)]
*  What is the status now? Like we were going to have this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=528.28s)]
*  It was going to be they were going to take the conference vote. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  Everyone's going to come together. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=533.28s)]
*  We're going to elect a speaker today. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=534.28s)]
*  Now we're in recess. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  We still have Patrick McHenry as the interim speaker or Speaker Pro Tem, who has no actual [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  constitutional authority other than occupying the chair while we wait for a speaker be elected. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  So Sahel, what happens now? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=545.78s)]
*  We don't know yet, Chris. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=548.8s)]
*  There are no updates. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=549.8s)]
*  The House is still frozen. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=550.8s)]
*  They adjourned for the day. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  They're back tomorrow at noon. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  We don't even know if they're going to have a vote tomorrow. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=554.8399999999999s)]
*  They haven't scheduled it yet. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=556.68s)]
*  It's very simple here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  They're going to vote once Steve Scalise has at least 217 votes out of 221. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=559.28s)]
*  We have no idea how long that's going to be. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=564.04s)]
*  There is a strong sentiment within the Republican conference, nearly unanimous, I would say, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  among the people I've talked to, which is that they shouldn't go to the floor of the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=571.0s)]
*  House until they have the votes for a speaker and, you know, put themselves in the country [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=574.04s)]
*  through that humiliation of 15 ballots. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't really serve anyone, but, you know, this ultimately does come down to Steve Scalise. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=581.2s)]
*  It will come down to Steve Scalise, Republicans say, in terms of when to call that vote. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=586.24s)]
*  Only he can decide, you know, when the numbers are there, and only he can tell them, okay, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  let's go to the floor. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=594.48s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=595.48s)]
*  All right, Sahel Kapoor and Michael Steele, thank you very much. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DPns20HNY&t=596.48s)]
