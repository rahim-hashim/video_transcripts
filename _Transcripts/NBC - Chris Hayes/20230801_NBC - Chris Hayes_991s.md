# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 31
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU)
*  Joining me now is Tamar Harleman, senior reporter with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=5.26s)]
*  D.A. Willis says her team is ready to go, as we just heard her say. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=6.88s)]
*  August, of course, begins tomorrow. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=10.4s)]
*  Do we have any indication to give us any more precise idea on timing? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, we actually just got a little bit in the last hour or so. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=16.6s)]
*  George Chidi, who's an independent journalist down here in Georgia, confirmed that he got [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=20.96s)]
*  a subpoena to come testify before both of the regular grand juries that are meeting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=26.46s)]
*  here in August and are expected to hear potential Trump-related charges. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=32.06s)]
*  And his subpoena date says anywhere between August 7th and August 31st. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=37.14s)]
*  So that means we're not expecting potential indictments this week, but we could see it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=42.92s)]
*  next week, the week after, and potentially even later into August. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=46.94s)]
*  And Tamar, while we're on that, just quickly, what is his role or alleged role in this Georgia story? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=52.18s)]
*  George Chidi stumbled upon the meeting of alternate Republican electors at the state [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=59.34s)]
*  Capitol here in Georgia in mid-December of 2020. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=63.9s)]
*  He was there waiting to observe the regular Democratic electors who were scheduled to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=68.12s)]
*  go at noon, but he saw some Republicans he knew walk into a room and he thought, OK, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=74.5s)]
*  that's interesting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=79.18s)]
*  He tried to enter the room. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=80.18s)]
*  He was recording on his phone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=81.98s)]
*  He was booted out and told that it was an educational meeting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=83.1s)]
*  And of course, we find out later that that was the meeting of the Republican Trump electors [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  who did end up opening the meeting to the public so people could record. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=93.02s)]
*  But his testimony could be very crucial, especially since it looks like the DA is still very interested [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  in who organized and participated in this meeting of the electors. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=103.38s)]
*  A very educational meeting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=108.02s)]
*  Tamar, I understand that cameras are allowed in Georgia state courtrooms. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=110.02s)]
*  So let me just clarify this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=113.74s)]
*  If Donald Trump is arraigned in Fulton County, it will likely be on video. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=115.7s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=119.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=120.5s)]
*  A lot of that depends on the judge who's going to be overseeing the case that day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=121.5s)]
*  So we have to file the special paperwork if we want to shoot cameras or record audio in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=125.78s)]
*  a courtroom. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=130.74s)]
*  So far, we haven't encountered any problems with that under Judge McBurney as we've gone [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=132.1s)]
*  through the investigative part of all of this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=136.34s)]
*  Although we don't know who the judge is going to be, should Trump or others be indicted [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=138.78s)]
*  in Fulton County? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=142.58s)]
*  And it all depends on them and what they see. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=143.58s)]
*  And of course, the Secret Service will be involved in any sort of negotiations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=146.02s)]
*  Should Trump himself be indicted? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=150.06s)]
*  And of course, they don't want to do anything to put the former president in harm's way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=151.66s)]
*  So perhaps they'll make a push to not have this be televised. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=156.54s)]
*  I feel like if Donald Trump has televised arraignment, a lot of our viewers are doing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=161.5s)]
*  a Stephen Colbert popcorn gif right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=165.98s)]
*  Today, Tamar, you reported on a ruling from the judge on a motion by Trump's team to quote, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=169.22s)]
*  gut the Fulton County District Attorney's investigation of interference in Georgia's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=174.5s)]
*  2020 presidential election. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  What was the motion and how did the judge rule? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=180.66s)]
*  This was a long time coming. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=184.54s)]
*  The former president's lawyers submitted a motion back in March that sought to not only [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=186.22s)]
*  disqualify D.A. Willis from continuing the investigation, they sought to remove Judge [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=190.98s)]
*  McBurney, who's been overseeing this entire process. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=195.06s)]
*  They wanted to kill the final report of the special grand jury that helped compile evidence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=197.66s)]
*  for the D.A. and suppress any of the evidence that they had pulled together during their [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=202.74s)]
*  term. So they really tried to throw the kitchen sink at all of this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=207.38s)]
*  The judge smacked them down after we waited a couple of months for this ruling. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  There is a question about whether there will be an appeal, especially before we expect [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=216.78s)]
*  the D.A. to seek indictments. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=221.5s)]
*  And there is a hearing scheduled next week with a different judge. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=223.82s)]
*  Trump's attorneys recently tried to go over Judge McBurney's head to try and get him to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=227.94s)]
*  rule. And that hearing is on the books for next week. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=232.54s)]
*  We'll still see if that's going to happen, although it's seeming less likely, especially [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  if Mr. Trump's lawyers appeal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=240.14s)]
*  One last question tomorrow. A lot of this has been playing out publicly from D.A. Willis' [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=243.42s)]
*  interview with NBC correspondent Blaine Alexander, where she reinforced the seriousness of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=246.78s)]
*  the inquiry to the released portion of the special grand jury report, to the grand jury [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=251.26s)]
*  instructions that were recently broadcast. We just saw Willis speaking over the weekend. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=255.5s)]
*  Could this be a model for other prosecutors, particularly as they pursue cases against [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump, that this level of transparency works? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=263.82s)]
*  Potentially. And it is something that you see Trump and other folks who are targeted in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  this investigation. We've heard them complaining a lot about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=273.58s)]
*  You see it often in legal filings, this very Trump motion today that the judge ruled on, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=276.3s)]
*  one of the arguments they were making for disqualifying the D.A. from the investigation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=280.86s)]
*  was because D.A. Willis has been so out front at least explaining her process and that she [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=284.94s)]
*  was looking for justice. They argued that it compromised the probe. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=290.54s)]
*  The judge said, no, I don't think so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  But he did mention how it is a different level of not transparency, but just openness that we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  don't typically see with this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=302.7s)]
*  Today we got new polling out that is devastating news for every Republican presidential candidate, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=304.62s)]
*  not under criminal indictment. The poll results could be considered funeral rights for the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=310.86s)]
*  non-Trump Republican Party. Simply put, it's done. If you had any doubts that this is Trump's race [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=316.06s)]
*  and Trump's race to lose, this poll will clear things up for you. I mean, here is the headline [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=323.1s)]
*  from the latest New York Times, Sienna poll, and it sums up everything you've heard about [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=327.98s)]
*  Trump crushing DeSantis and GOP rivals. Among Republicans, the ex-president tops DeSantis [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=332.3s)]
*  with 54 percent, the Florida governor holding onto a mere 17 percent. That is a 37 point lead [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  that Trump holds over DeSantis, nearly 40 points. And when the whole slew of candidates is put on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=349.74s)]
*  the board against Trump, not one candidate besides DeSantis tops 3 percent. DeSantis even loses on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  fighting so-called woke-ness in this new poll. If you've been paying any attention to the 2024 [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=362.22s)]
*  Republican primary, you know that fighting the woke is very dear to Ron DeSantis' heart. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=367.42s)]
*  Because it's a war on truth, I think we have no choice but to wage a war on woke. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=373.5s)]
*  On day one, we are going to rip the politics out of the military. We're going to end the woke agenda. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=378.22s)]
*  Woke is ultimately assault on the truth. We've made Florida the state where woke goes to die. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=384.86s)]
*  And as president, I will fight the woke in the corporations. I will fight the woke in the schools. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=390.62s)]
*  I will fight the woke in the halls of Congress. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=396.38s)]
*  Stirring pseudo-Chichillion staff, but when it comes to Republican voters who want to fight woke-ness, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=404.22s)]
*  however they define it, Donald Trump again crushes DeSantis. Look at the numbers, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=410.54s)]
*  not even close. Trump at 61 percent and DeSantis at 36 percent. That is a 25-point lead for the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=414.54s)]
*  ex-president. Donald Trump is also, by the way, the fun candidate apparently. 54 percent of Republican [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=421.1s)]
*  voters say he is more fun compared to DeSantis. Trump is also far ahead of DeSantis among Republicans [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=426.62s)]
*  who quote, accept transgender people as the gender they identify with, and among those who do not, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  he beats Ron DeSantis on both fronts. When it comes to Trump's criminal indictments on dozens of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=437.98s)]
*  felonies, only 17 percent of Republican voters believe he committed a crime. 71 percent believe [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=443.98s)]
*  he has not committed any. But when that question is posted to MAGA voters, zero percent, zero, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=449.42s)]
*  believe he committed a crime. Oh, it's not a cult. That is the ex-president's loyal base standing by [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=456.94s)]
*  his side, no matter what. Simply put, Donald Trump owns this Republican party, he owns this GOP [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  presidential race, and no one is even coming close to beating him for the nomination. In fact, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=469.74s)]
*  no presidential primary candidate who has had this kind of lead in the polls at this point in the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=474.22s)]
*  primaries has ever lost. With the first primary debate in roughly three weeks, Trump has said he [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=479.42s)]
*  is not showing up, and honestly, why would he? Today he posted, quote, let them debate so I can [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=485.18s)]
*  see who I might consider for vice president. Ouch. But he kind of has a point. Right now it is a race [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=491.66s)]
*  for second place. You may remember Tricia Cotham. She is the state representative in North Carolina, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=499.34s)]
*  who abruptly switched from Democratic to Republican this past spring. Cotham's switch [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=505.82s)]
*  handed the GOP gerrymandered state legislature their a veto-proof majority. It allowed them to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=510.78s)]
*  ram through a 12-week abortion ban that was opposed by the state's Democratic governor. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  The ban not only takes away the rights of pregnant women in that state, but it also hurts people from [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=521.74s)]
*  other southern states with abortion bans who had been traveling to North Carolina for health care. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=525.66s)]
*  And this was all possible because of party-switching Tricia Cotham, who voted with [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=531.02s)]
*  her fellow Republicans for the ban. It was weird because several years before in 2015, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=535.5s)]
*  Cotham drew national attention for sharing her own abortion story on the floor of the North Carolina [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=540.62s)]
*  State House. My first pregnancy ended in an induced physician-assisted miscarriage. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=545.26s)]
*  While I served in this chamber, my doctor told me that this pregnancy would likely not be viable [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=554.78s)]
*  and that if I did not take swift medical action, my life and any hope of future babies [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=563.18s)]
*  would be in severe danger. Abortion is a deeply personal decision. It should not be a political [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=574.62s)]
*  debate. My womb and my uterus is not up for your political grab. So what on earth led that person, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=584.2199999999999s)]
*  someone who spoke out passionately for abortion rights and just ran last year as a pro-choice [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=594.4599999999999s)]
*  Democrat, to suddenly betray her voters? Two New York Times reporters did a deep dive on the very [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=599.1s)]
*  suspicious party-switching of Tricia Cotham that, quote, blew up North Carolina politics. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=605.02s)]
*  Kate Kelly, a Washington correspondent for the New York Times, was on that story, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=610.9399999999999s)]
*  and she joins me now. Kate, thanks so much for coming on the show. You report that some big-name [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  North Carolina party figures encouraged Cotham to run in the primary in 2022, but they weren't [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=619.5s)]
*  Democratic party figures, were they? No. The majority leader of the Republican Party then and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=625.42s)]
*  now, John Bell, spoke to Tricia Cotham before she filed for the primary last March and encouraged [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=631.42s)]
*  her to run. And we also learned that the Speaker of the House, Republican Tim Moore, who was [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=636.9399999999999s)]
*  Speaker last term and is now, encouraged her to run along the way, although he said he hadn't [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=641.9799999999999s)]
*  talked to her before the primary. So we know that from the very get-go, GOP, sort of deep-rooted [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=647.0999999999999s)]
*  interests within North Carolina were backing Tricia Cotham. They say they didn't know that she [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=655.34s)]
*  was going to switch parties. They say they regarded her as a centrist Democrat in a redrawn district [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=660.22s)]
*  that was going to go to a Democrat regardless, so they wanted someone who would reach across the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=665.74s)]
*  aisle. And to be fair, that is some of her history, is sort of collaborative impulses with [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=669.74s)]
*  Republicans on certain issues. However, you're very right to point out that she ran on a pro-choice [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=676.5400000000001s)]
*  agenda. She ran as an ally to the LGBTQ community. She ran as someone that was going to give local [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=681.66s)]
*  sheriffs autonomy when it came to going along with ICE, among many other policy positions that she [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=687.74s)]
*  has now effectively reversed with her votes, commentary, and other signals. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=693.3399999999999s)]
*  Yes, and you guys write how Tricia Cotham's victory in November helped Democrats lock in enough seats [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=698.4599999999999s)]
*  to prevent by a single vote a Republican supermajority in the state house. And then, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=704.14s)]
*  just three months after she took office, as we've discussed, she switches parties. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=709.1s)]
*  I wonder what has been the reaction in her district? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=712.78s)]
*  Oh, bitterness, betrayal, anger. And she's had some pretty awful things to contend with since [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=716.46s)]
*  April 5th when she switched. I mean, death threats, her tires slashed, her car keyed, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=723.82s)]
*  abusive and sort of violent messages. So none of this is good. But people are extremely bitter [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=728.62s)]
*  and feeling betrayed. I mean, she was the goat in a sort of standup comedic Saturday night live [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=735.58s)]
*  type thing in Charlotte called Charlotte Squawks that my co-writer David Perlmutt attended. That [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=741.6600000000001s)]
*  didn't even make the story because there's so many aspects to the sort of rage and frustration in [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=747.0200000000001s)]
*  that community. And part of it, Maddie, I think, is that she really hasn't fully explained her change [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=751.98s)]
*  of heart. Her party switch speech on April 5th essentially boiled down to there's too much group [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=756.94s)]
*  think in the Democratic Party. They're too process oriented. I don't recognize them. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=763.5s)]
*  And they're nasty. They've been mean to me. And throughout the reporting of the story, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=767.66s)]
*  I really tried to get her on the phone. I tried to get her to elaborate on some of the very specific [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=771.66s)]
*  policy disputes that drove her away. But I have not been able to shake that loose [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  and nor has any other reporter in the North Carolina press corps that I've seen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=780.3s)]
*  Well, you mentioned meanness. I just want to talk about that. You quote her former [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=785.26s)]
*  campaign consultant saying that she told him, quote, the Democrats don't like me. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=788.4599999999999s)]
*  The Republicans have helped me out a lot and been nice to me. We often try to reduce political [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=792.54s)]
*  battles to ideology or policy. But a lot of the time, it's ego, it's anger, it's personal stuff. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=797.26s)]
*  And I feel like we see that with Kissed in Cinema and Joe Manchin too in the Senate. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=802.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the reaction that I've heard from a lot of people in the last day or so is that [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=807.18s)]
*  this seemed like it was about petty personal rivalries. It was about a feeling of personal [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=810.78s)]
*  injury. And it's interesting, you know, the campaign consultant you mentioned told me that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  there was almost a very Trumpian kind of narcissistic approach here. Like everyone's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=820.14s)]
*  against me. They used to be for me. You know, she even before she switched stances, she was [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=825.8199999999999s)]
*  frustrated at not getting, for example, the endorsement of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=832.22s)]
*  But she also did not attend the board meetings with that group that are required to get a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=837.02s)]
*  candidate endorsement. And ironically, when she came into office in January, she soon co-sponsored [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  a bill that would have codified Roe v. Wade in North Carolina. Now think about that. I mean, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=847.74s)]
*  you're quite right to quote her famous floor speech from 2015 that's very much of a pro-choice [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=852.38s)]
*  clarion call. But as recently as late January of this year, she was a co-sponsor on a Roe bill. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=857.98s)]
*  And within, you know, three, four months, she reverses her stance on what had proved to be a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=863.74s)]
*  critical issue because this state was very much a destination, like a very rare oasis of access [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=868.46s)]
*  for abortion within the Deep South up until July 1st. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=874.7s)]
*  So I got to ask Kate, in your reporting, did you get to the bottom of all this, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=879.5s)]
*  what you highlight there? Because she's a progressive pro-choice Democrat when she's [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=884.14s)]
*  in the state house before. Then she goes out of office. She co-founds a lobbying firm where one [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=888.7s)]
*  of her partners was a major donor to state Republicans and also president of a company [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=892.86s)]
*  that built charter schools, which she was once against. She comes back into office as a Democrat [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=897.1800000000001s)]
*  only briefly and then switches to the Republicans. You report that Republicans were pushing her to [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=901.74s)]
*  run. So am I allowed to speculate and say, hold on, was she a Republican the whole time when she [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=906.54s)]
*  was coming back to office? Do we have evidence of that? Well, that's the open question. I mean, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=911.74s)]
*  I can't say more than I have learned through the reporting. I mean, we know that Republicans [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=916.78s)]
*  encouraged her to run and at least one prominent one encouraged her before she ran. We also report [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=920.78s)]
*  that some of her biggest donors on the campaign trail were two PACs, one related to dental [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=925.5799999999999s)]
*  professionals in North Carolina, another related to nursing home facilities that give almost [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=930.62s)]
*  entirely or predominantly to Democrats. We know that on the very first day of this term, maybe, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=935.34s)]
*  which was January 11th, she was one of the escorts to bring the house speaker to the dais. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=940.62s)]
*  And the other Democrats in that group, one was the minority leader from the opposing party, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=947.66s)]
*  obviously. The other two had longer tenures and were regarded as close to the speaker. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=951.58s)]
*  So there were all these signs that she was at a minimum friendly with. And yet, Kate, sorry, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=956.46s)]
*  sorry to jump in. We're out of time. And yet she switched and we still don't know why, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=961.6600000000001s)]
*  but your reporting has helped us understand. Kate Kelly, thank you so much for your reporting. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=966.22s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=970.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlX875vXrlU&t=986.46s)]
