# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 18  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=0.0s)]
*  Rough. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=3.6s)]
*  I said please don't be too nice. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump admits he crossed the line but demands immunity like a cop who gets away [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  with breaking the law. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=12.0s)]
*  The President of the United States must have immunity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=13.56s)]
*  Tonight the dark implications of Trump's new manifesto. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=18.56s)]
*  Then the latest attack on E. Jean Carroll inside the Trump defamation trial. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=21.64s)]
*  Plus. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=26.6s)]
*  Let's just wait and see what happens to New Hampshire. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=27.6s)]
*  If Nikki Haley wins New Hampshire then I think we've got a race in our hands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=29.36s)]
*  New polling and new expectation setting for the next vote in New Hampshire as global elites [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=32.96s)]
*  warm to the indicted ex-president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=38.28s)]
*  I don't think they're voting for Trump because of his family values but he wasn't wrong about [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=40.76s)]
*  some of these critical issues. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=44.36s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=45.96s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=53.0s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=54.0s)]
*  We're awaiting a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Donald Trump's audacious [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=55.6s)]
*  and dangerous claim of near total presidential immunity for crimes he committed while in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=59.32s)]
*  office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=63.96s)]
*  In court last week, as you probably remember, Trump's lawyer argued the president should [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=65.2s)]
*  have the power to effectively do whatever he wants including, for instance, having a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=68.84s)]
*  political rival assassinated by SEAL Team 6 or selling pardons and could face no criminal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=73.76s)]
*  accountability or prosecution unless he was first successfully impeached and convicted. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=80.56s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=86.12s)]
*  That's an official act in order to seal Team 6? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=92.68s)]
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=95.4s)]
*  criminal prosecution. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=100.44s)]
*  But if he weren't, there would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=101.44s)]
*  Chief Justice's opinion in Marlborough against Madison and our Constitutional tradition and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=106.96s)]
*  the plain language of the impeachment judgment clause all clearly presuppose that what the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  founders were concerned about was not... [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=117.0s)]
*  I asked you a yes or no question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=122.08s)]
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=126.96s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  So your answer is no. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=133.28s)]
*  My answer is qualified yes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=136.16s)]
*  It was always clear that these weren't particularly sound legal arguments. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=139.12s)]
*  You could almost hear the resignation in Trump's lawyer's voice as he slowly, against his own [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=142.4s)]
*  will, allowed himself to be backed into the proverbial corner. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=147.88s)]
*  And that's because these arguments are not rooted first and foremost in an interpretation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=151.2s)]
*  of the law and the Constitution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=154.76s)]
*  Rather, they were reverse engineered to arrive at the conclusion Donald Trump is demanding. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=156.2s)]
*  In case there are any questions about that, the ex-president effectively admitted it himself [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=161.76s)]
*  on social media today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=165.88s)]
*  In all caps, he ranted, quote, a president of the United States must have full immunity. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  Even events that cross the line must fall under total immunity. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=171.6s)]
*  Which sure sounds like a tacit admission of guilt, doesn't it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  In a bizarre analogy, he compared himself to a dirty cop, quote, you can't stop police [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=179.76s)]
*  from doing the job of strong and effective crime prevention because you want to guard [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=184.04s)]
*  against the occasional rogue copper bad apple. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=187.88s)]
*  Sometimes you just have to live with great but slightly imperfect. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=191.28s)]
*  And then for good measure, he ended with a not so subtle message to the 6-3 MAGA majority, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=196.32s)]
*  quote, hopefully this will be an easy decision. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=201.68s)]
*  God bless the Supreme Court. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=203.8s)]
*  Not a lot of subtext there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=206.32s)]
*  Don't need some sort of like decoder ring. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=208.96s)]
*  He's saying what he believes, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=212.44s)]
*  This is an authentic expression of Trumpism, as authentic expression of Trumpism as we [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=216.2s)]
*  have ever seen from the ex-president himself. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=220.92s)]
*  It is what this entire campaign and the movement is centered around now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is the singular animating focus, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Immunity, the concept he is above the law, the nation is under his control, that he will [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=231.0s)]
*  be a dictator on day one of his second term. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=235.0s)]
*  And for that vision to function, the ex-president needs to craft a legal context in which he [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=237.72s)]
*  cannot be held accountable by the very institutions that he wishes to control. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=241.6s)]
*  In Trump's view, even when the president, and let's just be clear, not just any president, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=246.76s)]
*  him really, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=252.12s)]
*  Like he wouldn't feel this way about Joe Biden or Barack Obama, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=253.88s)]
*  When the president, Donald Trump, does things that are obviously illegal over the line in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=257.02s)]
*  his own words, as he puts it, he still must have full immunity as long as he enough cronies [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=261.84s)]
*  on his side to prevent impeachment and conviction in Congress, which Trump knows he has, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=267.84s)]
*  I also think it's particularly notable that Trump compared himself to rogue cops and bad [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=273.44s)]
*  apples, which is to say police officers who break the law. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's true, police officers are rarely held legally accountable for official misconduct. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  The dubious legal doctrine of qualified immunity means that officers can almost never be sued [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  for violating your rights. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=293.0s)]
*  Fatal shootings by police are rarely prosecuted, even if they are unjustified. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=295.32s)]
*  But also, there is not blanket criminal immunity for cops. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=299.4s)]
*  Criminal prosecutions for accountability for police misconduct do happen sometimes, like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  in perhaps the most famous instance of a police killing in my lifetime. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  today for the murder of George Floyd. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=319.84s)]
*  Thomas Lane, one of the other former Minneapolis police officers charged in connection with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=322.2s)]
*  George Floyd's death nearly two years ago, has agreed to plead guilty. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=327.32s)]
*  Jay Alexander King took a plea deal back in October to avoid a state criminal trial. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  The ex Minneapolis officer is already serving a federal sentence related to the death. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=336.52s)]
*  This sentence of 57 months in prison for Chauvin, one of the officers involved in George Floyd's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=341.0s)]
*  death, is significantly higher than even what prosecutors were asking for. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=347.11999999999995s)]
*  Remember, those four officers were acting in their official capacity. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  No question when George Floyd was murdered, they were wearing uniforms, they were responding [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=354.88s)]
*  to a call. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=359.28s)]
*  They were still prosecuted and then convicted. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=360.42s)]
*  Trump's theory, such as it is, is that he deserves even less scrutiny than the already [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=365.0s)]
*  threadbare standard we've set for police in this country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=370.76s)]
*  Now a lot of these legal arguments surround, of course, they're about this trial that we're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=375.64s)]
*  expecting this year, particularly the trial for January 6th, the events leading up to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=379.56s)]
*  it, the attempt to subvert the Constitutional Republic, and the subtext for this entire [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=384.6s)]
*  back and forth unfolding before the courts is, will Donald Trump be able to shrug off [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=387.88s)]
*  criminal charges for attempting a coup? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=393.56s)]
*  But it also goes beyond that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  I think it's sort of important to internalize this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=397.12s)]
*  Avoiding prison may be Trump's most pressing concern, but it is not the only reason he [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=402.24s)]
*  wants total unaccountability as president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=406.8s)]
*  He is running for president again, after all. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=408.86s)]
*  As of now, he appears to be cruising to the Republican nomination. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=412.22s)]
*  If and when he is nominated, he's got a real shot at retaking the White House. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=415.14s)]
*  So imagine what he will do if the courts affirm that he cannot ever face justice without an [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  impeachment in the House and a conviction in the Senate first. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  If his lawyers will admit out loud in front of a judge that Trump cannot face charges [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=431.7s)]
*  for ordering the military to assassinate his opponents, just imagine what Trump is speculating [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=435.1s)]
*  about in private. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=439.86s)]
*  The judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals should be, and I imagine are, thinking long [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=442.86s)]
*  and hard about what affirming Trump's argument would mean for the fate of this country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=448.7s)]
*  Andrew Weissman worked for years in the Department of Justice, most recently as the lead prosecutor [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  for Special Counsel Rara Mueller's office. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=457.98s)]
*  Ellie Mistal is the justice correspondent for the nation, and they join me now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=460.1s)]
*  The legal theory is, I think, bunk. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=466.26s)]
*  But there's a deep, I mean, the theory is articulated again in this post. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=470.7s)]
*  I think it's the genuine theory of governance at issue here, and it's the one that's presented [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=475.98s)]
*  before the court. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=481.0s)]
*  Well, in some ways, there are ways that this may go even beyond what was argued. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=482.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=488.18s)]
*  It's more extreme. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=489.18s)]
*  Because you don't hear the impeachment first theory. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=490.18s)]
*  That's the argument that has been made to the court. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=493.74s)]
*  I think in many ways, though, Donald Trump, by saying this, he's always going to lose [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=496.5s)]
*  in the D.C. Circuit, and that is just not credible. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=501.42s)]
*  I don't think it helps him, actually, to say this out loud so often, especially this sort [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=506.2s)]
*  of, this is what you can expect. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=513.38s)]
*  For anybody except the most diehard sort of, we need a king, not a president, this kind [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=516.74s)]
*  of language is, oh, this is the door that you are opening. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=523.44s)]
*  I think it's both geared to this argument and an argument that I think may be made if [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=529.12s)]
*  it goes to the Supreme Court, which has to do with, was I acting as the president or [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=534.36s)]
*  was I acting as somebody campaigning? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=539.2s)]
*  So he's saying, give me the benefit of the doubt here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=542.2s)]
*  I may have crossed the line, not in terms of legality, but in terms of, I might have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=545.2s)]
*  crossed the line towards campaigning, but I should still be immune. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=549.44s)]
*  By the way, there is just no basis for either of those in terms of saying in the criminal [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=553.12s)]
*  law context. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=559.48s)]
*  Frankly, even for, as you noted, even for police officers, the qualified immunity doctrine [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=560.48s)]
*  is a civil doctrine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  It is very hard to do it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=569.72s)]
*  It should be prosecuted more, but there is no doctrine of full immunity for criminal [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=571.0200000000001s)]
*  prosecution for anyone. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=577.52s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=579.4s)]
*  For anyone. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=580.76s)]
*  And you had this observation, Ellie, which I thought was good. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=581.76s)]
*  You said to recap, everybody agrees Trump's lawyer fell into a trap last week when he [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=586.12s)]
*  said that Trump could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=589.64s)]
*  So Trump's responsibility to demand the immunity to allow him to assassinate political rivals. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  This is embracing precisely the sort of reductio ad absurdum that he was pushed into by the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=596.52s)]
*  judge. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=602.84s)]
*  What I think Trump and his lawyers forget, I think, is that they ain't president yet. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=603.84s)]
*  So if the Supreme Court says that the president have this complete immunity from prosecution [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=608.64s)]
*  or whatever, what's to stop, oh, I don't know, the actual president, Joe Biden, from launching [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=614.24s)]
*  a preemptive strike on a rebel stronghold at Mar-a-Lago to engineer regime change? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=619.88s)]
*  What's to stop Biden from doing that? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think Trump has thought this through. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=627.6s)]
*  It's like on the next page of his bedside copy of mine, he hasn't gotten to where the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=629.64s)]
*  logic of his argument goes. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  But for the record, as Andrew was saying, I do not think that Biden has the power to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=637.52s)]
*  launch a strike against his political rival. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=643.86s)]
*  I think it would violate Posse Comitatus and, you know, murder. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=646.4s)]
*  And so I think that Biden, if he did that, would be prosecuted. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=651.68s)]
*  Trump doesn't seem to understand and the people who support Trump don't seem to understand [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=655.56s)]
*  that the powers he calls onto himself then must be given to every single other president. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=660.1199999999999s)]
*  But I think John Roberts will understand that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=666.16s)]
*  That I think is important distinction because I think the Supreme Court does understand [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  that, although they could find ways around that too. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=672.0s)]
*  But I mean, like, remember, we Bush v. Gore, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=674.52s)]
*  Good for one right only. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=677.04s)]
*  But that said, I think that's exactly correct. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=679.8599999999999s)]
*  But the other thing I think about this is it's not he never he's not articulating a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=682.8s)]
*  broadly applicable principle. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=686.8s)]
*  He's talking about himself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  And not only is he talking about himself, I think very strongly this threat that the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=689.68s)]
*  republic is going to be torn apart by prosecutions as reprisal is an explicit threat to prosecute [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=699.8s)]
*  Like 100 percent. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=700.8s)]
*  It's not clever. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=702.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not subtle. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  He is saying I will. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=705.3599999999999s)]
*  That is the purpose of this entire enterprise. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=707.66s)]
*  I stay out of prison. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  I will go after my political rights. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=711.88s)]
*  You know, that issue came up in the D.C. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=713.64s)]
*  Circuit when one of the judges said, you know, if we go along with what you're proposing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=715.76s)]
*  government, won't there be this problem of, you know, enormous number of prosecutions [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=722.36s)]
*  of former presidents? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=728.2s)]
*  And the government's answer was that's been the law. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  That is the understanding. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=732.88s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=734.2s)]
*  That hasn't happened. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=735.2s)]
*  We're zero. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=736.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=737.2s)]
*  And the reason it's happening now is because we're in a situation where factually somebody [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=738.2s)]
*  has broken the law. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=742.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=743.72s)]
*  And I think that point was a really important one when it came up in our arguments. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=744.72s)]
*  But it is the reason that he specifically is raising it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=748.6400000000001s)]
*  It's also like, Ellie, to me, you know, again, everyone needs to understand the core of the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  argument being made here. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=758.5200000000001s)]
*  Like there is this kind of form and content like higher synthesis that's come together [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=759.6s)]
*  where like both the practical reason for running is immunity and the theoretical cause they're [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=763.66s)]
*  pursuing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=768.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=769.66s)]
*  Like it's all together. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=770.66s)]
*  Like I am over the law. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=771.66s)]
*  I am the state. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=772.66s)]
*  I mean, like, and we've seen this before in history. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=773.66s)]
*  What Trump is trying to do is, as you pointed out, stay out of jail. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=776.5799999999999s)]
*  But people need to, again, play the tape all the way through the end. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=780.52s)]
*  If he stays out of jail, if he wins the nomination, if he gets reelected president, y'all think [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=784.1999999999999s)]
*  he's leaving. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=789.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=790.3399999999999s)]
*  He's not leaving ever again. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=791.3399999999999s)]
*  He only leaves in a casket. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=792.86s)]
*  He's president for life or, as Caesar would have said, dictator for life if you give him [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=794.82s)]
*  power again. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=800.5s)]
*  So I think all of this is in play. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=801.9s)]
*  And this is I do believe that the Supreme Court justices understand the live wire that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=803.3000000000001s)]
*  they're dealing with. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=808.94s)]
*  Obviously, the bought justices Clarence Thomas and Alito, they probably like it that way. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=809.94s)]
*  But I think there is a great chance that people like Roberts, people like Barrett will say [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=814.12s)]
*  we can't have this because and the last point I'll make about this, a guy like Roberts, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=820.54s)]
*  a guy like Neil Gorsuch, what they're most concerned about is their own power. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=825.9s)]
*  And I do think at some level, they have to understand that if they let Trump get back [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=831.1s)]
*  in, the Supreme Court is moot. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=835.78s)]
*  Actual threat to the power of the court. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=837.78s)]
*  And we saw in oral arguments yesterday, as you were talking about with Joy last night [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=839.9s)]
*  and online about this sort of imperiousness to their sort of power grab. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  That's a direct threat to them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=847.6600000000001s)]
*  Why have we not gotten the decision yet? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=850.58s)]
*  You know, that's an impossible question. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=854.7800000000001s)]
*  But it's on our minds. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=856.74s)]
*  You know, so first, remember, they're right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  They're going to write something that they have to be bulletproof. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=861.86s)]
*  They know that this could be and there's a good chance it got reviewed by the Supreme [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=864.94s)]
*  Court. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=868.58s)]
*  So there's that to it is not one judge. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=869.58s)]
*  It's three judges. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=873.62s)]
*  And so to the extent that at the oral argument, you know, Henderson may be deciding on a different [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=875.06s)]
*  ground. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=882.8599999999999s)]
*  There will be, I think, a lot of back and forth to try and see if they can find some [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=883.8599999999999s)]
*  unanimity on a particular theory. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=887.0999999999999s)]
*  That would be my guess because you're working as a committee. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=889.4599999999999s)]
*  Now, Henderson is Republican appointee. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=892.8599999999999s)]
*  The other two judges were appointed by Democratic presidents. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=895.26s)]
*  Henderson was appointed by George H.W. Bush. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=897.6199999999999s)]
*  And even she was like, this is crazy for me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=899.9799999999999s)]
*  So trying to get them all together on the same page, I think. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=903.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  Andrew Weissman, Ali Mastal, we will keep watching. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=906.9399999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=909.54s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=910.54s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=911.54s)]
*  Tomorrow, maybe? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=912.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=913.54s)]
*  Coming up, Donald Trump wasn't at his New York defamation trial today. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=914.54s)]
*  That did not stop a flurry of damning new testimony against him. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=918.1s)]
*  And you know, we're going to cover the trial even when he's not there. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=921.06s)]
*  Lisa Rubin was in the courtroom today. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=924.66s)]
*  She joins me with all the details next. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=926.22s)]
*  For the first two days of E.G. Carroll's second defamation trial, Donald Trump came to court [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=931.46s)]
*  to make a spectacle of himself, to seemingly try to intimidate Carroll on the witness stand, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=935.7s)]
*  to cast himself as a real victim, to the media to pick a fight with the judge. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  He was not in court today, but footage of what he said at that press conference yesterday [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  was. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=948.5400000000001s)]
*  Carroll's attorney showing the jury the moment he claimed that it's all a, quote, made up, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=949.5400000000001s)]
*  fabricated story. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=954.02s)]
*  Remember, a separate jury already after a trial and evidence found Trump liable for [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=955.86s)]
*  sexually assaulting Carroll in the dressing room of the Manhattan department store in [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=962.26s)]
*  the 1990s and for defaming her by calling her claim, quote, a lie. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=966.5s)]
*  The current trial is only to determine damages for other defamatory statements made by Donald [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=971.18s)]
*  Trump. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=976.74s)]
*  Today, E.G. Carroll was back on the stand where Trump's lawyer asked her about becoming, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=977.74s)]
*  quote, famous because of what happened. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=981.9s)]
*  Do you believe you're more well known because the allegations you brought against my client, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=983.46s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=987.7s)]
*  Carroll responding, yes, I am more well known and I am more hated by a lot of people. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=988.7s)]
*  I am partaking in this trial to bring my old reputation and status back. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin has been inside the courtroom since the trial began and she [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=997.7800000000001s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1003.1800000000001s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  What happened in court today? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1005.98s)]
*  Today was like a study in two courts, right? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1006.98s)]
*  We had the morning session where E.G. Carroll was still on the stand until lunch and then [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1009.74s)]
*  we had a very soporific afternoon session where both sides examined E.G. Carroll's damages [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1013.62s)]
*  expert who testified to the fact that in her estimate it would cost somewhere between $7 [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1019.82s)]
*  and $12 million to restore E.G. Carroll's reputation. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1025.02s)]
*  That was slow. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1029.26s)]
*  It was ponderous. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1030.6200000000001s)]
*  There were lots of objections. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1032.14s)]
*  It was a study in how Lou Kaplan has maintained control of his courtroom and lost control [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1033.86s)]
*  sometimes of his patients. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1038.3s)]
*  But E.G. Carroll was the star of this morning. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1040.06s)]
*  And as you noted, Alina Haba's theme seemed to be Donald Trump made you famous, didn't [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1043.6200000000001s)]
*  he? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1049.7s)]
*  And E.G. Carroll's response to that was, no, first of all, if people know me better now, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1050.7s)]
*  not everybody likes me. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1055.7s)]
*  My life has been turned upside down. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1056.9s)]
*  And to the extent that I am famous, it's because of my hard work, not because of his defamation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1059.54s)]
*  It's also interesting, too, like, just what, you know, defamation is something that goes [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1065.96s)]
*  all the way back to common law, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1072.04s)]
*  And the notion is the value of someone's reputation is important. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1074.72s)]
*  This is like there's biblical injunctions about this, both in the Old Testament. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1078.68s)]
*  And what's being sort of litigated here is like what the tangible material harm done [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1082.92s)]
*  to a person by calling them a liar. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1087.72s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1090.0s)]
*  In fact, Ashley Humphreys, who's E.G. Carroll's expert, testified to that today because she [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1091.0s)]
*  was asked sort of what are the components of her reputation? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1094.72s)]
*  And she said, well, reputation has two parts. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1097.56s)]
*  Part of it is economic. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1100.16s)]
*  Will people hire you? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1101.54s)]
*  Are you less employable because of damage to your reputation? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1102.66s)]
*  But the other part is moral. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1105.76s)]
*  Are you a trustworthy individual? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1107.58s)]
*  Do people want to associate with you? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1109.18s)]
*  So to your point, there is a sort of moral or ethical component to the restoration of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1111.22s)]
*  her reputation. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1116.24s)]
*  And I'll venture a guess that to E.G. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1117.24s)]
*  Carroll, that's the more important part here and the one that's more difficult to quantify, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1118.74s)]
*  even though it's separate from the emotional harm that she has suffered as a result of [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1124.12s)]
*  Trump's attacks. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1128.04s)]
*  What I find so interesting here is that this is someone, what he has done to E.G. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1129.04s)]
*  Carroll is particularly, in my mind, despicable and targeted and destructive, but it is of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1133.36s)]
*  a piece with things that he has done to so many people. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1138.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1141.6399999999999s)]
*  And today, he's, I mean, this is the other thing, right? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  There's the sort of sense of like restitution for the price of what you have suffered, right? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  The cost of it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1152.2s)]
*  He's on Truth Social today. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1153.32s)]
*  I mean, he will not stop defaming her over and over and over again. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1154.8s)]
*  And on a day that he's supposed to be mourning his former mother-in-law, who by all accounts [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1159.52s)]
*  was very devoted to his wife and child, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1163.68s)]
*  A person who probably deserved his attention today didn't get it because he was too busy [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1166.8s)]
*  defaming E.G. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1171.3s)]
*  Carroll. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1172.3s)]
*  I should also note that you mentioned the video that he made as recently as today and [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1173.3s)]
*  that Robby Kaplan tried to show it to the jury but was stopped because Alina Haba said [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1178.22s)]
*  it was a partial clip of the entire press conference that Trump had given. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1183.8000000000002s)]
*  And somehow, she wanted the jury to see all of it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1188.76s)]
*  I'm not sure how Trump's defense gets any better by playing the rest of what he said [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  other than, you know, a small clip of his further defamation of E.G. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1197.72s)]
*  Carroll, but that's the sort of wacky world we live in, in Trump legal minds. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1202.28s)]
*  There's been back and forth. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1206.94s)]
*  I mean, one of the things we saw yesterday, the day before, and a bit today is Trump's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1207.94s)]
*  lawyer, Alina Haba, sort of jousting with Kaplan. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1212.76s)]
*  I saw someone, a person who's practiced in the federal bar saying, I would like, if this [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1216.28s)]
*  happened to me in a federal district court, I would like leave the court and walk into [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1220.6000000000001s)]
*  the sea because Judge Kaplan once said, like, why don't you take a break and go remember [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1223.84s)]
*  how to introduce things into evidence? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1228.08s)]
*  There has been a real kind of like envelope pushing by Haba, a la Donald Trump, all throughout. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1230.64s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just Haba. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1236.3600000000001s)]
*  Her partner, Michael Medeo, who examined the damages expert today, at one point, Kaplan [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  got so angry with him and essentially said, we all know Lincoln was the 16th. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1244.3600000000001s)]
*  Move on. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1249.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, because they kept circling the same wagons, they can't pivot. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1250.3200000000002s)]
*  They're not nimble with the rules of evidence to understand how to move forward when they're [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1253.5600000000002s)]
*  blocked on a particular line of questioning. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1258.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1261.3200000000002s)]
*  And Kaplan, again, we sort of have been talking about these trials as interesting, you know, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  precursors and prologues for the criminal trial. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1271.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1273.76s)]
*  They're different in certain ways. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1274.76s)]
*  We saw Judge Angoran really struggling to control Trump and Trump's lawyers. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1275.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  Kaplan seemed to have a bit of a harsher line and a sort of stronger hand, but also struggling [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1281.6399999999999s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1285.76s)]
*  What would you say about his control of the courtroom? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1286.76s)]
*  I think Kaplan is in control of the courtroom. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1288.6799999999998s)]
*  That having been said, Alina and her co-lawyers are definitely trying to suggest to the jury, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1291.48s)]
*  even in their body language and their acceptance of defeat by him, that he is 100% biased against [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1298.4s)]
*  them and not giving them a fair shake. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1304.68s)]
*  So when he shuts her down, she'll say things like, okay, sure. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1306.44s)]
*  As if to suggest there's something illegitimate about this and you should be suspicious of [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1311.56s)]
*  it as well. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1315.76s)]
*  I'm so glad that you're in the courtroom, honestly, and that you're coming here to talk [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  to us because you can't get this stuff, obviously, through courtroom sketches and even textual [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1321.3999999999999s)]
*  reporting. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1325.48s)]
*  So thanks for doing it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1326.48s)]
*  Well, I wish the cameras were there, but thank you for having me. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1327.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1329.48s)]
*  Lisa Rubin. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1330.48s)]
*  Still ahead, the ever-shrinking Republican majority. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1331.48s)]
*  How new court orders are chipping away at the Republicans' chances to keep control of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  the House of Representatives. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1337.8s)]
*  Next. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1342.8s)]
*  The slim House majority, or the Republicans won in the 2022 midterm election, has dwindled [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1346.88s)]
*  significantly. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1352.48s)]
*  Thanks to the vacancies caused by, one, George Santos' expulsion, and two, Kevin McCarthy's [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1353.68s)]
*  abrupt retirement after being turfed out of the speakership, Republicans now control just [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1359.16s)]
*  220 seats compared to the 213 seats Democrats hold. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1364.4s)]
*  That's a difference of seven, which means they could only lose three votes to carry [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1369.92s)]
*  a majority. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1373.3600000000001s)]
*  And in this election year is actually looking more like Democrats have a decent chance of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1375.14s)]
*  retaking the chamber. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1379.18s)]
*  Now, those chances are aided by a set of court decisions that have thrown out some wildly [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1380.38s)]
*  and aggressively gerrymandered and unconstitutional congressional maps to certain states. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  Remember, it started in Alabama last October when a federal court picked a new congressional [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1389.6200000000001s)]
*  map for that state. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1394.8600000000001s)]
*  It said, quote, completely remedies the vote dilution that we found. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  For an idea of how gerrymandered the Alabama congressional map was, the state population [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1400.5800000000002s)]
*  is about 27 percent black. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1404.74s)]
*  But because of how the districts are drawn, black voters only had one majority district, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1406.5400000000002s)]
*  giving them about 14 percent of the representation in the House delegation. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1410.7s)]
*  Supreme Court itself said that was unconstitutional and violated the Voting Rights Act. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1415.0600000000002s)]
*  With the new map, that representation could go up to 29 percent closer, much closer, to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  the proportion of the Democratic vote in the state, mostly black. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1424.22s)]
*  Louisiana is in a similar situation with a new map that adds another black majority [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1428.66s)]
*  district, which likewise could give Democrats an additional seat. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1433.42s)]
*  That new map passed the state Senate yesterday. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1436.9s)]
*  It's now in Louisiana House for debate. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1439.0600000000002s)]
*  So those are two seats that can flip from Republicans to Democrats. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1440.66s)]
*  And then in Wisconsin, this is really interesting. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1444.7s)]
*  So remember, the state Supreme Court in Wisconsin, just throughout their wildly partisan, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1447.38s)]
*  gerrymandered state maps, that's the state legislature and state Senate, there is now [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1452.22s)]
*  a lawsuit over their congressional maps that are also quite aggressively gerrymandered. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1456.0600000000002s)]
*  It cites the fact that in 2022, Republicans running for the House, Congressional House, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1461.1399999999999s)]
*  won about 57 percent of the vote. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1466.5s)]
*  That translated into control of 75 percent of the state's House seats. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1469.3s)]
*  Joining me now is Mark Elias, a lawyer specializing in election litigation, founder of the website [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1475.02s)]
*  Democracy Docket that tracks that litigation. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1479.6999999999998s)]
*  He's also representing the Wisconsin voters currently challenging their congressional map. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1481.82s)]
*  All right, Mark, let's start with Wisconsin. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1486.58s)]
*  This is very interesting. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1488.4599999999998s)]
*  The Supreme Court has ruled that partisan gerrymandering as opposed to racial gerrymandering [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1490.02s)]
*  is not something the court can do anything about. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1496.02s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1498.22s)]
*  Your lawsuit is not to the federal Supreme Court, but rather to the state Supreme Court, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1499.46s)]
*  but about the congressional maps. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1504.66s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1506.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1508.5s)]
*  So look, we have a federal system in which you can bring claims in federal court. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1509.5s)]
*  If there are federal claims in state court, you can bring state constitutional claims. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1513.82s)]
*  You could also sometimes bring federal claims. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1517.46s)]
*  So it's not that unusual. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1519.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, my law firm, in addition to the Alabama case and Louisiana case you mentioned [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1520.46s)]
*  in federal court, we've successfully, for example, challenged the fact that the New [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1525.3s)]
*  York map congressional map needs to be reopened and we're successful there. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1530.06s)]
*  And so in Wisconsin, what happened is that the governor, the Democratic governor and [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1534.86s)]
*  the Republican legislature after 2020 was unable to pass a map. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1540.78s)]
*  They were unable to agree on a new congressional map. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1544.62s)]
*  And so the came to the courts to do so. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1547.9s)]
*  And the state Supreme Court, which at that point was one of the most conservative majorities [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1552.02s)]
*  in the country, said bizarrely that you would use the least change approach. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1557.1000000000001s)]
*  In other words, they would start with the map that the that had previously been in place. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1562.26s)]
*  Well, that map had been an extreme Republican. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1567.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1569.98s)]
*  So so, you know, what happened recently is that the state Supreme Court in the state [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1570.98s)]
*  legislative case you mentioned said the least change approach is wrong. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1576.38s)]
*  It violates the state's constitution. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1580.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not appropriate in Wisconsin. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1583.0600000000002s)]
*  So we then my law firm then promptly brought this case under that directly in the state [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1584.98s)]
*  Supreme Court, actually reopening the prior case. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1591.18s)]
*  Yeah. So there's so there's a bunch of there's there's a bunch of litigation happening on [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1593.8600000000001s)]
*  these state maps. New York, we've seen Alabama, Louisiana have drawn new maps. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1597.22s)]
*  New York's probably going to have to draw new maps. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1600.7s)]
*  You've challenged the maps in Wisconsin. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  There's also a lot of litigation ongoing around access to the ballot and voter ID. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1604.94s)]
*  This is a tweet from Ronald McDaniel saying the GOP and the North New Hampshire GOP filed [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1609.94s)]
*  a motion to defend New Hampshire's voter ID law from bad faith DNC attacks that it's the [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1615.18s)]
*  75th election integrity lawsuit. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1619.94s)]
*  The RNC is engaged in this cycle alone. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1622.26s)]
*  We will keep fighting for fair and transparent elections. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1624.3000000000002s)]
*  How much are you meeting? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1627.5800000000002s)]
*  How much is this this sort of fight happening in the states around questions of voter ID [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1629.1000000000001s)]
*  and ballot access? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1633.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh, tremendously. The rules of voting matter. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1635.54s)]
*  You know, where you put polling places determines who gets to vote, how you allow people to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1638.1399999999999s)]
*  obtain and return mail in ballots affects the outcomes of elections. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1644.1799999999998s)]
*  We know that it's not just ID. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1648.4599999999998s)]
*  It's a whole range of rules where Republicans try to make it harder to vote and easier to cheat. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1649.86s)]
*  And so Democracy, which you mentioned, I found in 2020 just put out its annual report. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1655.2199999999998s)]
*  And what it found is that there were 146 court orders last year in across 34 states. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1660.26s)]
*  And the good news is that the conservatives and the Republicans lost twice as many as we want. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1668.78s)]
*  So the good news is the good guys, not just me, but generally the good guys, the pro voting guys won [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1678.82s)]
*  two times as many as the other side did. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1684.5s)]
*  So they file a lot of lawsuits, but they lose a lot. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1688.54s)]
*  It was striking to me, you know, Nikki Haley, I was I was thinking of you actually when this [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1691.18s)]
*  happened in that the other night, I believe, was in the debate with DeSantis. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1694.98s)]
*  And she said, you know, Joe Biden won, which was good. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1701.34s)]
*  Like, well, that's true. Earth is round to start. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1705.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's this round crowd exists. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1709.22s)]
*  But before she did that, she did a whole preamble about the problems of the election. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1711.42s)]
*  We need election integrity and all this. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1715.46s)]
*  And so one of the things I've seen is that even Republicans who will reject the big lie, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1717.22s)]
*  right, which is sort of just a preposterous lie and indefensible, will also sort of see this kind of [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1721.9s)]
*  sense that like there's something amiss, there's something wrong, there's something that has to be [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1728.14s)]
*  tightened up. And I wonder what effect you think that rhetoric has even from people who are doing [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1732.14s)]
*  it in the context of rejecting the big lie. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1736.98s)]
*  Oh, I think it's incredibly corrosive and I think it's putting democracy under enormous amount of [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1739.7s)]
*  pressure. And I think we're going to see that in 2024 because, you know, our system of elections have been [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1743.82s)]
*  badmouthed now by one political party, not just Donald Trump, but by the entire political party now for [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1749.1s)]
*  four plus years. And our system is set up where there is a pageantry of democracy that all [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1754.82s)]
*  people buy into, whether they are win, whether they win or they lose, whether they're happy or unhappy with [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1762.06s)]
*  the results. And the Republicans have weaponized that pageantry of democracy and turned it into a cynical [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1766.3s)]
*  game to try to discredit the outcome of elections. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1771.78s)]
*  I'll tell you one quick statistic. So in the, you know, as you pointed out, after 2020, Donald Trump and his [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1774.8999999999999s)]
*  allies litigated a lot of cases. I was fortunate enough to represent President Biden and the DNC. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1781.3799999999999s)]
*  We won 64 of 65 cases. And one of those cases was, as you recall, and I think we talked about it at the [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1786.1399999999999s)]
*  time, the state of Texas tried to throw out the election results of four entire states in late December. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1793.02s)]
*  Counties. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1799.54s)]
*  2020. And 126 members of the House signed on to that brief. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1801.42s)]
*  126. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1807.74s)]
*  Now, 126 members of the House signed on to a brief to throw out the results in four states. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1809.34s)]
*  Then you have January 6. That night, 139 Republican House members voted to throw out one or more [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1815.8999999999999s)]
*  results. Now, fast forward to just yesterday and the brief filed by the 140 [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1823.02s)]
*  members of Republican members of Congress to try to keep Donald Trump on the ballot, notwithstanding [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1829.82s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. Chris, the problem is getting worse. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1836.74s)]
*  It's not getting better. And, you know, you do a tremendous job of pointing that out, but we can't let ourselves [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1840.02s)]
*  become desensitized to just how bad Republicans are on voting. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1846.26s)]
*  Mark Elias, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1851.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1854.66s)]
*  Still to come, Donald Trump, the politician, has always claimed to be against the elites. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1855.7s)]
*  So why is Wall Street lining up behind the so-called man of the people? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1859.3000000000002s)]
*  That's next. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1862.5s)]
*  There's been a lot of really good reporting on the possible agenda of a second Trump administration, and [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  largely it's terrifying. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1873.94s)]
*  It's a vision of retribution based government or presidential dictatorship that crushes dissent, triggers [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1876.26s)]
*  mass deportations, or for all those radical plans to essentially subvert American [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1881.34s)]
*  democracy. There is a central aspect of Trumpism that's very old school Republicanism, and that is helping [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1886.86s)]
*  out the richest Americans and the biggest corporations. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1892.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, you don't hear it from Trump on the campaign trail, and he heaps on the populist authoritarian [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1895.62s)]
*  red meat to adoring crowds of, quote, everyday people. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1900.3s)]
*  But as Jeff Stein of The Washington Post reported this month, behind closed doors, Trump is telling people [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1903.1s)]
*  close to them he would like to push through a big second round of tax cuts for the biggest corporations. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1908.42s)]
*  If you were paying attention, this has been a dynamic of Trumpism all the way back to 2016. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1915.42s)]
*  All of Trump's America First populism had him railing against the establishment donor class and taking [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1920.66s)]
*  back the country for the little guy and doing it with really dark overtones. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1925.7s)]
*  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1930.98s)]
*  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interest, they partner [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1936.1s)]
*  with these people that don't have your good in mind. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1942.22s)]
*  So that's what he said to voters. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1947.42s)]
*  And then a week after he won that election, he went to the 21 Club Restaurant Midtown Manhattan, a former [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1948.74s)]
*  speakeasy frequented by the rich and the powerful. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1954.78s)]
*  And he told the plutocrats there something completely different. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1957.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1962.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1963.3799999999999s)]
*  Happy Sir President Elected. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1963.8999999999999s)]

*  We'll get your taxes down. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1966.18s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1967.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1968.18s)]

*  Make America great again. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1974.18s)]
*  Yeah, they loved him. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1975.98s)]
*  We'll get your taxes down, don't worry. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1976.98s)]
*  That was one of the rare promises that Donald Trump absolutely kept. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1979.54s)]
*  In 2017, he signed a one point five trillion dollar tax cut bill largely for the rich and corporations. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1983.1s)]
*  It was hands down the largest, the least popular piece of legislation he ever signed and his [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1989.02s)]
*  most important, a plan that gave lots of breaks to the rich, to corporations and didn't stimulate [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=1995.06s)]
*  the economy. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2000.1s)]
*  It also, and people forget this, it gave Trump his lowest approval rating until the Capitol [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2001.1s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2005.9s)]
*  Trump is now thinking about doing it again because fundamentally that is whose interest [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2006.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is looking to serve, even as he accuses his challengers of being captured [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2011.82s)]
*  by rich special interests. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2017.02s)]
*  Nikki Haley has been in the pocket of the open borders, establishment donors her entire [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2019.58s)]
*  career, and she's a globalist. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2024.06s)]
*  You know, she likes to globe. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2026.66s)]
*  I like America first. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2028.42s)]
*  She likes the globe. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2031.26s)]
*  What makes that rhetoric especially rich is that at this very moment, the globalists, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2033.1s)]
*  the global financial elites are gathering together in the stately Alpine ski resort [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2036.98s)]
*  town of Davos, Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum convention. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2040.54s)]
*  So is the donor class fearful of what another Trump term portends for them? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2045.42s)]
*  Nope. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2049.42s)]
*  Not according to multiple US executives in Davos who spoke with CNBC this week. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2050.78s)]
*  One prominent US business executive who asked not to be named said a Trump victory won't [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2055.3s)]
*  be the end of the world. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2059.34s)]
*  Another US bank CEO privately told CNBC that Trump is quote, all bark and no bite. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2060.86s)]
*  The bank chief then added quote, he's going to win the presidency. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2065.34s)]
*  Many of his policies were right. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2068.6600000000003s)]
*  The point that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, had no trouble making on the record. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2070.1400000000003s)]
*  He's kind of right about NATO. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2075.82s)]
*  Kind of right about immigration. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2077.94s)]
*  He grew the economy quite well. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2079.9s)]
*  China virus. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2081.86s)]
*  Tax reform worked. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2082.54s)]
*  He was right about some of China. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2083.82s)]
*  As a CEO of a multinational global business, what you think would be better for the business? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2085.2200000000003s)]
*  I have to be prepared for both. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2091.78s)]
*  I will be prepared for both. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2093.7400000000002s)]
*  We will deal with both. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2095.42s)]
*  My company will survive and thrive in both. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2097.1400000000003s)]
*  I love Jamie Dian saying tax reform work. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2100.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2103.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2104.7s)]
*  JP Morgan got an enormous tax cut like every other corporation it worked. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2105.66s)]
*  The global financial elites of Davos will be just fine because the Trump tax cuts were [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2110.58s)]
*  great for them. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2115.74s)]
*  As everyday Americans consider how a reinvigorated revenge seeking President Trump will stick [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2116.98s)]
*  it to the left and to immigrants, to gay and trans folks, to women seeking bodily autonomy, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2122.1s)]
*  it is absolutely clear to me that while a second Trump term threatens American democracy [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2126.7799999999997s)]
*  and threatens a lot of Americans, it sure does not threaten America's Davos set. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2130.98s)]
*  There was supposed to be a debate tonight. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2139.62s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2141.14s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2141.98s)]
*  ABC and CNN both canceled the Republican primary debates. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2142.98s)]
*  They had scheduled ahead of next Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire after Donald Trump [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2146.18s)]
*  and Nikki Haley declined to participate. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2151.22s)]
*  Now, Trump also skipped the previous debates and nevertheless won Iowa with 51 percent [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2153.3s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2158.22s)]
*  Nikki Haley has absolutely zero reason to do single combat with Ron DeSantis, who's [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2159.1s)]
*  way behind her in New Hampshire. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2163.38s)]
*  The Granite State looks to be make or break for Haley's campaign. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2165.38s)]
*  She's hoping independence will break for her. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2168.18s)]
*  The latest tracking polls are not looking amazing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2170.38s)]
*  So no more debates, no more drama for once. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2173.74s)]
*  A lack of drama might work to Trump's advantage. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2176.74s)]
*  Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party who left the Republican [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2179.94s)]
*  Party in 2020. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2184.34s)]
*  Brendan Buck served as counsel to Speaker Paul Ryan and press secretary, Speaker John [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2185.86s)]
*  Boehner, and they both joined me now. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2189.78s)]
*  Jennifer, let me start with you as someone who knows New Hampshire politics. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2191.98s)]
*  What is your read on how things are looking there as we are just a few days away from [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2195.34s)]
*  the primary? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2200.34s)]
*  Well, I would say that I don't I don't see I don't see things going well for Nikki Haley. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2202.42s)]
*  I think that dropping out of the debates was a big mistake. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2208.1400000000003s)]
*  Frankly, she seems to have forgotten that debates aren't supposed to be about the candidates. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2211.38s)]
*  They're about the voters. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2216.1400000000003s)]
*  And in New Hampshire, there's a strong sense of wanting maximum exposure to the candidates, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2217.54s)]
*  getting maximum information from them. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2223.94s)]
*  And she needed something big and bold and different in order to kind of make up that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2226.3s)]
*  gap between her and Donald Trump. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2232.46s)]
*  And she's just not doing it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2234.3s)]
*  Instead, what we're seeing are the numbers that came out yesterday. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2235.7400000000002s)]
*  Post Iowa actually have Trump higher. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2238.1800000000003s)]
*  He's over 50 percent in at least two of them. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2240.58s)]
*  And the gap between them is growing. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2242.9s)]
*  That's interesting. I mean, one of the things, Brendan, one of the things that sort of the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2246.06s)]
*  question here is about independents who it's not affiliated voters can vote in the New [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2250.74s)]
*  Hampshire primary. All the polling suggests those folks are much more amenable to Haley [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2254.86s)]
*  than Trump. But Republicans are much more amenable to Trump. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2258.9s)]
*  This, of course, is not anything new. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2261.94s)]
*  And New Hampshire has a wrinkle because there might be a lot of independent voters, but [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2263.94s)]
*  it's still, as DeSantis said, an uphill climb to win a Republican primary if you're not [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2268.34s)]
*  winning a majority of Republican voters. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2273.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. You have to be a conservative to win the primary. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2276.02s)]
*  And I think Nikki Haley is certainly a conservative. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2280.3s)]
*  The problem is, though, that she has developed a bit of a reputation as being a never Trump [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2283.34s)]
*  at this point. And that's really working against her. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2288.38s)]
*  And her unfavorables are way higher than you would like to see. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2290.82s)]
*  It's the catch 22 that any of these Republicans have. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2294.1000000000004s)]
*  You need to go after your opponent. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2297.18s)]
*  You need to go after Donald Trump if you're going to take him down. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2298.66s)]
*  And they failed to do that. But if you do, like Chris Christie did, you become wildly unpopular [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2302.2999999999997s)]
*  with a lot of Republicans. So there's no real good, safe place to go. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2307.3799999999997s)]
*  Now, ignoring him, I don't think was the right path. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2311.7s)]
*  I think we'll look back and say that that was a big failure on all of their parts. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2314.18s)]
*  But there's just to be clear, there was no easy way to beat Donald Trump. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2318.3799999999997s)]
*  He was probably always going to be the nominee, but they clearly didn't bring any any [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2321.94s)]
*  game changing strategies that put that in question. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2326.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to your point, I think you're right. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2329.62s)]
*  Like to the degree of some sort of like taint of being a never Trump or has sort of wafted [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2331.74s)]
*  over Nikki Haley, it's because she's running Donald Trump and doing decently well, hence [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2337.8999999999996s)]
*  competing with him. And as a logical matter, that must be the case. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2342.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. Like this is the sort of inescapable by Jennifer that everyone has found. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2347.14s)]
*  And I mean, it's the reason that you left the Republican Party fundamentally. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2353.38s)]
*  I think there's some question of like, oh, does the makeup of New Hampshire voters like [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2356.94s)]
*  this is the St. Anson poll just to show it, you know, among registered Republicans, Trump's [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2360.1400000000003s)]
*  up by 40 point 65, 25 to Sanchez eight among undeclared. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2364.5s)]
*  It's Haley 52, Trump 37 to Sanchez four. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2368.94s)]
*  But again, it doesn't you don't think there's going to be enough of those latter category [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2372.82s)]
*  in order to tip the balance. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2377.86s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2380.46s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to me to hear the idea that Nikki Haley is being looked at as [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2383.06s)]
*  a never Trump or that that's what's keeping her down. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2390.26s)]
*  Nikki Haley served in his administration. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2392.58s)]
*  Nikki Haley has already committed her vote to Donald Trump. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2394.42s)]
*  Right. He become the nominee. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2397.54s)]
*  But the I think the issue here is less about Nikki Haley and more about Donald Trump. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2399.9s)]
*  Donald Trump's support in the Republican Party has been unwavering for eight years now. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2405.18s)]
*  To Buck's point, there was never a chance that anyone other than Donald Trump was going [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2412.42s)]
*  to be the nominee. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2418.46s)]
*  And Nikki Haley simply hasn't shown, I guess, the courage that is necessary to take on Trump [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2419.8199999999997s)]
*  in a way that would actually impact his support within the voter base. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2426.8599999999997s)]
*  And in the primary, no matter what those undeclared voters do, in the end, the as you [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2432.22s)]
*  just showed in the numbers, the Republicans overwhelmingly want Trump. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2438.7s)]
*  Brendan, to stay with us for a second, there was a moment where people and again, we don't [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2445.2999999999997s)]
*  know what will happen on Tuesday. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2449.98s)]
*  It's possible the voters surprise us. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2451.1s)]
*  I was in New Hampshire in 2008 when everyone had written the obituary for Hillary Clinton's [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2452.7799999999997s)]
*  campaign. It didn't work out that way. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2457.22s)]
*  She won that she won that primary that led to a very, very long extended primary fight [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2459.5s)]
*  between Barack Obama and her. So who knows? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2465.46s)]
*  That said, there was a reason people didn't think they could dislodge him back after the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2468.06s)]
*  twenty twenty two midterms. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2473.38s)]
*  There was a reason all those people got in the race and his polling reflected it. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2474.78s)]
*  Like, do you think I guess the question is like how inevitable were things turning or [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2479.06s)]
*  were there missed opportunities earlier on? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2483.58s)]
*  So I think there's a couple of missed opportunities. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2485.38s)]
*  One, I think it was a huge failure not to somehow draw him into any of the previous [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2487.58s)]
*  debates. He had no reason to debate, but they ignored him at the debates. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2491.5s)]
*  They didn't try to use his ego against him in any way. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2495.1s)]
*  But I think probably more than anything, there was really no appetite at any point for [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2499.1s)]
*  that. So, you know, this was this was probably an uphill climb from the very beginning. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2504.54s)]
*  We'll see what happens on Tuesday. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2510.06s)]
*  Jennifer Horn and Brendan Buck, thank you very much. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2511.46s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2513.54s)]
*  That does it for All In. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mNvxP74rE&t=2513.94s)]
