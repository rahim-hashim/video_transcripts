Video Description: “There is just no way for a reasonable person with elementary critical thinking skills to deny the seriousness of this case. This is about a real and existential threat to our nation. It’s about Donald Trump’s attempt and his continuing attempts to undermine and possibly end our democracy as we know it,” says Ali Velshi, as Trump faces a potential third indictment in the Department of Justice’s investigation into efforts to interfere with the 2020 Presidential election – which led to the insurrection on Jan. 6.

# Trump prepares for ‘Arrest and Indictment’ in Jan 6. probe
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk)
*  The gravest crime that Donald Trump ever committed was to undermine democracy, the will of the people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=0.0s)]
*  by trying to overthrow a free and fair election. And today we saw the first signs that justice [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  may be coming for him. Today we learned that the ex-president received a letter from the special [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=10.8s)]
*  counsel Jack Smith indicating that he is the target of a criminal investigation into efforts [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=15.52s)]
*  to interfere with the presidential election of 2020, leading to the insurrection on January 6, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=21.44s)]
*  2021. According to Trump, the special counsel gave him a four-day deadline in which to speak [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=27.76s)]
*  to the Washington DC grand jury hearing the case, it's an offer he will almost certainly not accept, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=33.6s)]
*  seeing that anything that he says can then be used against him in a subsequent trial. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=39.6s)]
*  And all of this indicates that the Department of Justice is wrapping up what has been a long and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=44.08s)]
*  sprawling investigation led by this man Jack Smith for the past eight months. We do not have any [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=49.44s)]
*  indication of what the exact charges are that Smith is considering, and the ex-president said [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=55.84s)]
*  himself a target letter like this quote, almost always means an arrest and indictment are coming. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=61.2s)]
*  That's exactly what happened just last month when Jack Smith sent Trump another target letter [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  regarding the investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. And just days after that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=71.76s)]
*  letter became public, Smith brought a 37-count indictment against the ex-president, charging him [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=77.12s)]
*  with seven federal crimes. Of course, that was already the second indictment against Trump this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=83.68s)]
*  year, following the 34 counts of falsifying business records charged by this man, the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg in April. But this indictment, the third against the ex-president, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=94.56s)]
*  and if and when it comes, will be by far the most consequential. While some people might argue that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  the charges about Donald Trump's business practices in New York, for instance, don't really matter, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=107.12s)]
*  or they just don't care that much about the documents at Mar-a-Lago, there's just no way for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=111.76s)]
*  a reasonable person with elementary critical thinking skills to deny the seriousness of this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=116.64s)]
*  case. This is about a real and existential threat to our nation. It's about Donald Trump's attempt [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  and his continuing attempts to undermine and possibly end our democracy as we know it. And [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=130.0s)]
*  in fact, there's already been a long and thorough investigation into this, resulting in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  recommendation of multiple criminal charges. That was done by the House January 6th committee. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=139.28s)]
*  Last year, they methodically laid out the evidence against the ex-president, showing the American [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=146.4s)]
*  people exactly how he attempted to remain in power against their will. He knew that he had lost the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=150.32s)]
*  2020 election, but he spread the lies about the fraud anyway, and his own attorney general at the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=156.4s)]
*  time, Bill Barr, said this to the committee. The president said something like, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=162.24s)]
*  well, we could get to the bottom. You know, some people say we could get to the bottom of this if [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=169.44s)]
*  the department sees the machines. It was a typical way of raising a point. And I said, absolutely not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  There's no probable cause, and I'm not going to seize any machines. I said, how long is he going [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=182.96s)]
*  to carry on with this stolen election stuff? Where is this going to go? And by that time, Meadows had [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=189.84s)]
*  caught up with me leaving the office and caught up with me and said that, he said, look, I think [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=197.12s)]
*  that he's becoming more realistic and knows that there's a limit to how far he can take this. And [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=212.0s)]
*  then Jared said, you know, yeah, we're working on this. We're working on it. Now that January [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=218.32s)]
*  6th committee also detailed how Trump launched a massive pressure campaign to try to get nearly [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  all corners of the government to do his bidding, including his own vice president. He tried to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  pressure state legislatures to reverse the results of the election in their states, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=233.92s)]
*  but they refused. He tried to enlist the Department of Justice in his efforts to overturn election [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  results, but officials leading the department refused to comply. So eventually he latched on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=247.36s)]
*  to a completely nonsensical and anti-democratic theory that one man, his own vice president, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  could determine the outcome of the election. He wanted the vice president to unilaterally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  select the president. And of course, on the advice of his own lawyers, Mike Pence decided [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=270.56s)]
*  that that was not his role. Donald Trump then summoned a violent mob of his supporters, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=277.76s)]
*  hurling them at the Capitol in a bloody attack on American democracy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=282.0s)]
*  Trump has given us marching orders. One post on the Donald dot win wrote, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=286.8s)]
*  basically, if you're east of the Mississippi, you can and should be there. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=291.6s)]
*  Advance on the Capitol. One user asked, is the sixth D-Day, is that why Trump wants everyone there? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=296.88s)]
*  Another asserted, Trump just told us all to come armed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=306.56s)]
*  I overheard the president say something to the effect of, you know, I don't f-ing care that they [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  have weapons. They're not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing mags away. Let my people in. They can [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  march the Capitol from here. Let the people in. Take the f-ing mags away. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=320.88s)]
*  That was the former White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, recounting how Trump wanted [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  the mags removed. Those are magnetometers that help detect guns. At the end of the January 6th [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=329.36s)]
*  investigation and after 10 public hearings, the committee referred four criminal charges against [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=334.88s)]
*  Donald Trump to the Department of Justice. We propose to the committee advancing referrals [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  where the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm and the centrality [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=352.32s)]
*  compel us to speak. Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=358.0s)]
*  and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. But until now, that's exactly what's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=365.52s)]
*  happened. The foot soldiers have gone to jail and the masterminds and the ringleaders have, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=371.76s)]
*  for the moment, had a pass. So here we are, seven months later at an historic moment with the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=376.32s)]
*  Department of Justice poised to finally bring charges against the ex-president in the January [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=381.12s)]
*  6th case. We've already seen and heard the evidence about Donald Trump's attempts to overturn [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=385.92s)]
*  the election and bring down our system of government. And if you believe that evidence, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=390.56s)]
*  then criminal charges are the only possible response because our democracy itself is at stake. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=396.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1J22ZlUMk&t=411.12s)]
