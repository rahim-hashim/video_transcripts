# 'Enraging': Republicans ‘suddenly’ see disinformation problem amid hurricane crisis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E)
*  Far-right cooks and conspiracy theories of all sorts have been part of our political landscape for a very long time now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=0.0s)]
*  But they're more powerful than they've ever been in my lifetime. They're on social media [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=5.84s)]
*  They're on Fox some now hold elected office even at the very top [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=10.16s)]
*  Now whether they do it out of cynicism cynicism or self-delusion or like they've just got brain worms [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=14.36s)]
*  They're all happy to promote outrageous [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=20.36s)]
*  Disinformation out the libs and the globalists and immigrants and lots of other people who can't defend themselves [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=23.2s)]
*  But then every once in a while [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Their ceaseless lies present a practical problem to the Republican political establishment. They serve [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=30.24s)]
*  There's a moment that I think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=36.04s)]
*  Exemplified this back in November of 2020 after Donald Trump won after Joe Biden won and Donald Trump started spinning lies about a rigged result [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=38.12s)]
*  There was still remember a pair of critical Senate runoff elections in Georgia [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=46.64s)]
*  Which would determine party control the Senate and Ronna Romney McDaniel the RNC chairwoman of the time [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=51.68s)]
*  Struggled to convince Georgia Republicans to vote [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=57.92s)]
*  Because they falsely believed their votes wouldn't be counted [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we have to we didn't see that in the audit so we've got it just that evidence I haven't seen so I will wait [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=74.32s)]
*  I'm gonna give money and work when it's already decided [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=82.48s)]
*  It's not decided. This is the key [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=86.84s)]
*  It's not decided if you lose your faith and you don't vote people walk away. That's that will decide it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=90.12s)]
*  Oh really? Oh now now you don't like that disinformation Ronna Romney McDaniel now you're standing up to tell them. No, no [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=96.12s)]
*  It's not decided. It's not rigged now. It's time to tell the truth that there will be bad consequences [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=102.82s)]
*  Republicans lost both those elections by the way [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=108.2s)]
*  And so now here we are watching Hurricane Milton hitting, Florida while still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in the southeast [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=110.46s)]
*  and I keep thinking of that Ronna Romney McDaniel clip because you've got government officials of both parties and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=117.7s)]
*  apolitical civil servants struggling to combat the rampant misinformation that far-right politicians pundits and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=124.0s)]
*  Influencers are spreading about the storms and disaster response from congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=130.64s)]
*  Posting repeatedly about they can control the weather to Elon Musk the diehard Trump supporting owner of the website [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=135.8s)]
*  Formerly known as Twitter using his site and his personal account to spread lies that officials say are hampering recovery efforts [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=143.48s)]
*  Listen to some of the lies that congressman Chuck Edwards decided he needed a rebut to be clear [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=151.56s)]
*  He's a Republican whose district covers some of the parts of North Carolina that were worst hit by Helene [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=157.56s)]
*  He felt the need to tell his own constituents that no [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=163.36s)]
*  Hurricane Helene was not geoengineered by the government to seize and access lithium deposits in Chimney Rock [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=166.62s)]
*  Adding quote nobody can control the weather [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=172.72s)]
*  He also stressed that FEMA has not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=176.0s)]
*  Diverted disaster response funding to the border or foreign aid more on that particular line a moment [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=179.28s)]
*  Also stating that no FEMA is not going to run out of money and that FEMA cannot seize your property or land [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=184.72s)]
*  That's a conservative Republican congressman trying to save his constituents from disinformation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=191.84s)]
*  spreading primarily among Republicans and conservatives on social media [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  He's not alone when social accounts started spreading a false rumor that FEMA was hiring private security [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  Contractors in Florida to keep evacuees away from their homes [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, it was debunked online by Christina pushaw a staffer for Florida governor Ron DeSantis saying spreading lies like this could have serious [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=214.84s)]
*  Consequences if people in evacuation zone see this and decide not to evacuate despite warnings from state and local emergency management [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=223.38s)]
*  They are unnecessarily putting their own lives and lives of first responders at grave risk [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=230.84s)]
*  If pushaws name sounds familiar, it's because she has spent much for career spreading anti-semitic anti-gay [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=235.88s)]
*  Anti-media conspiracy theories and fake news [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=242.4s)]
*  She helped popularize the term groomers a disgusting term to condemn anyone critical of Florida's don't say gay law [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=245.12s)]
*  Now imagine how bad the misinformation has to be for Christina to push off to say enough to enough is enough [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=252.44s)]
*  You're endangering people's lives [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=257.72s)]
*  Same can be said for Florida Senator Marco Rubio who just last week as we quoted on the show was telling his social media [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=260.12s)]
*  Followers, you can't trust the Biden White House and Bureau of Labor statistics on jobs numbers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=266.16s)]
*  Another fake jobs report out from Biden Harris government today. All the fake numbers in the world aren't gonna fool people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=270.44s)]
*  But this week Rubio was on Twitter telling his followers the path of hurricane Milton mirrored [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  What federal weather officials told him was a worst-case scenario [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=281.44s)]
*  You see now he needs his constituents to trust federal civil servants and follow their guidelines to survive the storm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=285.4s)]
*  Just days after he told them that the same federal civil servants lie [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=293.2s)]
*  See the problem here, right and of course the ultimate example of this is the big lie circulating about FEMA [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  Kamala spent all her FEMA money [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=307.06s)]
*  Billions of dollars on housing for illegal migrants housing assistance under FEMA [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  Almost any reasonable person would think would be available for Americans who are displaced from their houses in a time of disaster [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=316.58s)]
*  But that has been used on illegal immigrants [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=324.38s)]
*  How can we afford to give billions of dollars to illegal immigrants in this country? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=327.34s)]
*  But we've got to go back to the well to provide disaster relief for our own citizens. That's a disgrace [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=331.06s)]
*  Well, they can't even take care of people in North Carolina from a hurricane because they're too busy spending our taxpayer dollars [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=335.74s)]
*  Taking care of illegal aliens. This is the Biden Harris administration [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=342.44s)]
*  Caught red-handed [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  Dedicating a massive amount of money that was supposed to be there for emergency relief for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=348.22s)]
*  Americans in North Carolina Georgia and elsewhere to dispense to illegal immigrants while hurricane [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  Ravaged victims all over the country are left out to dry to be clear [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not like one of these things where it's a matter of interpretation or a kernel of truth. It's an absolute lie [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  stone-cold lie [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=371.54s)]
*  Started by Donald Trump then spread by his running mate his supporters on Capitol Hill all the lackeys you saw there Steve Scalise [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  The number two man in Congress his supporters on Fox [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  The lie says that FEMA lacks the resources for disaster victims because it spent the cash on undocumented migrants [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=382.74s)]
*  It is a lie that as you just heard was debunked by a Republican congressman from the affected area [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=388.94s)]
*  So here are the facts [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=395.62s)]
*  FEMA has enough funding in the short term to address immediate needs for both Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=397.22s)]
*  There is no funding connection between shelter for migrants and funding for disaster relief [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=403.62s)]
*  There is no intermingling of funds between these two programs [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=409.18s)]
*  That's not me saying it. It's the Republicans in charge of the House Appropriations Committee [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=413.94000000000005s)]
*  In a fact sheet they shared yesterday with Chad Pergam the congressional reporter for Fox [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=420.18s)]
*  Because they felt the urgent need to push back on a lie that is being spread by Fox News and by Donald Trump a lie [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=425.86s)]
*  Started by their candidate for President Donald Trump and amplified as you see by his campaign surrogates [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=433.02000000000004s)]
*  Passed along on the social media site owned by the billionaire funding one of his super PACs [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=438.22s)]
*  Republicans who suddenly see a conflict between the welfare of their constituents and the toxic affect their party's propaganda and also don't want to fly back [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  to Washington for an emergency session to fund FEMA when FEMA has money [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  Now struggling to explain their audiences that well up is up and down is down and water is wet and two plus two equals four and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=455.26s)]
*  You could laugh at it when their different major disinformation was mainly just costing them votes in winnable elections like Georgia [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=463.38s)]
*  But now it could cost lives in a massive complex disaster recovery. It is enraging [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=470.06s)]
*  That it took a crisis of these proportions to convince politicians who politicized everything that some government functions need to be above politics [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=476.14s)]
*  You [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV_PetaL6E&t=484.34s)]
