# 'This guy': Trump Jr.’s hunting buddy to be top food regulator at FDA
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI)
*  Amidst the ongoing bird flu epidemic that has pushed egg prices to new records, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=0.0s)]
*  will be pleased to hear we've got a new person in charge of food safety at the FDA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=4.64s)]
*  It's this guy hugging the dead bird on the left, a Florida lawyer who just happened to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=10.24s)]
*  be a hunting buddy and beer bros with Donald Trump Jr. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=14.8s)]
*  You see them there together. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=18.16s)]
*  They look happy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=19.16s)]
*  His name is Kyle Diamantis. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=20.16s)]
*  We think it's hard to find any record pronunciation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=22.64s)]
*  And he will be responsible for ensuring the safety of about 80% of the nation's food [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=27.6s)]
*  supply. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, his only relevant experience appears to be advising food companies and litigation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  against government regulations he is now set to oversee. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=39.32s)]
*  This is happening within days of Donald Trump firing the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=44.72s)]
*  General C.Q. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=49.2s)]
*  Brown, a black man who is a four-star general with over 40 years of military service, who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=50.2s)]
*  you can see here seated on the left in this photo of all the Joint Chiefs a few months [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  Trump also fired the head of the Navy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  Let's see if you can see which one that is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Yes, that would be Admiral Lisa Franchetti, a 30-year veteran who commanded at every level [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  and served in every fleet and who you can see standing in the back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=68.52s)]
*  This is the wall of the photos of all the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon yesterday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=73.12s)]
*  Do you notice who's missing? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=78.28s)]
*  The one black man and the one woman. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=80.3s)]
*  A hunting buddy of Trump Jr. is hired as an eminently qualified black man and woman who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=83.28s)]
*  have served their country for decades are fired. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=88.84s)]
*  What we're seeing from this administration is literally an inversion of a merit-based [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=92.8s)]
*  system into a spoil system for cronies and buddies of Trump and his kids. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=96.8s)]
*  As Adam Serwer writes, much of the callous lawlessness and destruction in the past few [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=105.32s)]
*  weeks can be understood as part of the administration's central ideological project, restoring America's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=109.36s)]
*  traditional hierarchies of race and gender. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=114.52s)]
*  Call it the Great Resegregation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=117.44s)]
*  Adam Serwer, staff writer at The Atlantic, joins me now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=120.24s)]
*  Adam, I really, really like this piece and the way that it framed what we've seen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=123.8s)]
*  What's your sort of major argument here about what I think is too charitably or credulously [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=127.44s)]
*  characterized as anti-DEI or anti-diversity moves by the Trump administration? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=133.68s)]
*  Well, I think the left did all this analysis about racial inequality persisting because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=139.44s)]
*  of structural factors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=146.24s)]
*  And I think the right essentially said, well, that's good. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=148.16s)]
*  We should not only keep those factors in place, we should keep anyone from analyzing or teaching [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=150.8s)]
*  about them and we should dismantle anti-discrimination law while we're at it just to make sure that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=155.34s)]
*  people who have been historically disfavored or historically judged as inadequate for getting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  jobs regardless of their qualifications should not be able to get those jobs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=165.04s)]
*  They want to take away the ladder of mobility for people they don't believe should have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=169.12s)]
*  it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=173.2s)]
*  And generally that means women and people of color. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=174.2s)]
*  Now look, if you happen to be an extreme Trump-toty, then they'll take a second look at you, obviously. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the point here about this sort of resegregation, there's a historical resonance [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=186.68s)]
*  here and one of the sort of periods we always forget because the way we're taught civil [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=193.08s)]
*  rights struggle and the struggle for black freedom particularly is as a kind of like [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=197.96s)]
*  continuous upward slope. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=202.8s)]
*  But Woodrow Wilson came into office and resegregated federal employment after it had been desegregated. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  In fact, it was one of the big accomplishments of the Reconstruction Republicans in the era [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=212.28s)]
*  was a federal government that was actually not segregated and Wilson resegregated it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=216.44s)]
*  Well, I think you need to remember, Chris, is that so much of private sector employment [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=222.52s)]
*  depends on network effects. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=229.0s)]
*  So the federal government has really been a tremendous ladder of upward economic mobility [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  for black people in America because the anti-discrimination protections are very strictly enforced. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=236.8s)]
*  And it doesn't depend on who you know. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=242.68s)]
*  You can work hard and work your way up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=244.28s)]
*  And so it's no coincidence that these stereotypes about federal workers being lazy, even though [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=247.0s)]
*  the data doesn't back that up at all, have come out, these stereotypes, and that they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=251.44s)]
*  being used to justify destroying what is an effective ladder of upward mobility for historically [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=256.84s)]
*  disfavored groups that are, again, judged not on their merit but on the color of their skin. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=263.48s)]
*  Yeah, and there's an irony here, which is that the actual system of civil service protections [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  in the federal government are what's called merit protections. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=274.76s)]
*  The whole idea is that it actually is a system that protects people based around their qualifications [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=280.04s)]
*  to do the job as opposed to, did you go hunting with the president's son, which is another [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=287.88s)]
*  alternate form of figuring out who to hire. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=294.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=297.24s)]
*  I mean, the only merit aspect of the Trump administration's hiring is how good you would [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=298.68s)]
*  be at licking the dirt off of Donald Trump's boots. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  Other than that, you know, it really doesn't have anything to do with whether or not you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=306.92s)]
*  can do the job, which is ironic, or maybe not so much ironic, but it's deliberate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=310.44s)]
*  They keep talking about how they will be colorblind or merit-based. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=314.6s)]
*  And what we see in terms of their hiring is the opposite of that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=317.8s)]
*  They are color-conscious, and merit is irrelevant as long as you are a Trump-toting. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that color-conscious point, which you make in the essay, I think is important, like [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=325.88s)]
*  the symbolism of firing C.K. Brown, General Brown, and the sense of head-hunting prominent [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=329.4s)]
*  women and people of color, black folks particularly, to kind of send the message, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=338.76s)]
*  like you are not welcome here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  You're not—we don't want you at the highest levels. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=345.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=349.4s)]
*  What they're saying is it doesn't matter if you're twice as good because you're not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=349.96s)]
*  the kind of person we want. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=354.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCv2BhnjPuI&t=355.88s)]
