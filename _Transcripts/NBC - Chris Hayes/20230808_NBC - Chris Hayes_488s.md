# Ohio Issue 1 fails in key victory for abortion rights
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ)
*  Today in the dog days of August, it was Election Day in Ohio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is thanks to state Republicans who earlier this year hastily changed their own laws [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=4.0s)]
*  to shove a special election onto the calendar during a time of year Republicans themselves know typically see low turnout. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=8.6s)]
*  It was a desperate, transparent attempt to stop Ohio voters from being able to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this fall. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=16.0s)]
*  You see, the ballot measure being voted on today, known as issue one, would raise the threshold to amend the state constitution from a simple majority vote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=25.0s)]
*  which it's been for over a century, to 60 percent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=32.0s)]
*  And it would come just in time to make it that much more difficult for what they should they know will be a big showdown in the fall. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=35.0s)]
*  That's when Ohio voters will have a chance to pass a constitutional amendment that would secure abortion rights in the state. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Basically, Ohio Republicans wanted to raise the threshold to 60 percent for that vote because they think they're going to lose it otherwise. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=48.0s)]
*  Progressives and abortion rights activists, along with all sorts of good government groups, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=56.0s)]
*  including quite a few former Republican officials, current Republican officials, have all rallied against issue one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=60.0s)]
*  Right now, according to the Secretary of State's tally, the no vote is enjoying an overwhelming lead. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=66.0s)]
*  With about two thirds of the vote at this hour, we are waiting for the Associated Press to make a projection. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=72.0s)]
*  But the Columbus Dispatch newspaper has already tonight made their call that issue one has failed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=77.0s)]
*  Jen Miller is the executive director of the Ohio Legal League Voters, part of the coalition leading the charge against issue one. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=83.0s)]
*  David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, author of Saving Democracy, a user's manual for every American. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=90.0s)]
*  And both join me now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=97.0s)]
*  Jen, first, tell me about the messaging, the organizing, the motivation around this, because at some level it's somewhat abstract procedural issue. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=99.0s)]
*  But one thing that is clear, independent of the outcome, was there was enormous turnout. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=108.0s)]
*  This was very, very much an issue front of mind for voters, despite the fact it happened the first week of August. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a neighbor to neighbor campaign where every day Ohioans got out and they knocked on doors and they sent postcards and they made phone calls and sent texts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=122.0s)]
*  And our strategy was simple, just to tell Ohio voters the truth, that our very freedoms were at stake here, that ballot issues are how we hold our government accountable when they're acting corrupt or they're not acting in our best interests. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=132.0s)]
*  And what we had was really a pan-partisan movement of Republicans, Democrats, independents, the libertarians, civic organizations, first responders, nurses, so many different groups of people coming together to defend our freedoms here in Ohio. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=149.0s)]
*  So it's a really exciting evening. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, those images you see are a rally for the no side that was opposing this and they're sort of holding a victory party. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=167.0s)]
*  Again, we don't have a call yet from the EAP. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=175.0s)]
*  Columbus Dispatch has called it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=177.0s)]
*  David, you and I have talked about this and about the sort of transparent bad faith at play in the gerrymandered Republican legislature shoving this onto the ballot in August, hoping to forestall and change the threshold for that fall vote on abortion rights. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=179.0s)]
*  What is your takeaway from what we're seeing unfold here? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=192.0s)]
*  Well, obviously it didn't work that people saw through it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=196.0s)]
*  Ohioans have done this a few times before. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=199.0s)]
*  There was an attack 11 years ago or so on labor rights. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=201.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=205.0s)]
*  I think the no side was very organized. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=206.0s)]
*  It crossed every partisan divide. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=209.0s)]
*  And the yes side, I think, in the end, they really, in the end, to the broader point, they couldn't really hide the fact that, again, this was all about abortion in November. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=211.0s)]
*  And in the end, Ohio's a 60-40 state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=220.0s)]
*  I think people saw this as a sneak attack. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=222.0s)]
*  And so those who care about abortion access showed up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=224.0s)]
*  But people far beyond that showed up and voted no because it just seemed to be this shameless attack on democracy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=228.0s)]
*  People saw through it, showed up and obviously voted down early. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=233.0s)]
*  And my guess is we're going to see the early vote. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=237.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=239.0s)]
*  The day of vote is pretty good for no as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=240.0s)]
*  You had it all up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=242.0s)]
*  But I think we have a nice win tonight for democracy, for abortion access. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=243.0s)]
*  And by the way, for the future of more reforms like ending gerrymandering that would have been cut out of the knees if this thing had passed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=246.0s)]
*  Jan, I've seen some people say, you know, independent of how this went down, maybe it should be the case that there's a higher threshold for a constitutional amendment for the state. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=253.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that in your communications with voters, maybe some people will raise that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=263.0s)]
*  What has been your argument about that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, some of the best policies that have been passed in Ohio have been done through constitutional amendments. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=270.0s)]
*  A lot of them did not pass by 60 percent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=275.0s)]
*  Even things like integrating the National Guard did not pass by 60 percent. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=278.0s)]
*  And so we have been able to point out this beautiful track record that we have here in Ohio where we've made our economy stronger, where we've extended rights, where we've awarded pensions to war vets and raise the minimum wage. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=285.0s)]
*  All of these things are how we were able to talk to everyday people and get them to turn out and vote no. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, we have some breaking news. The Associated Press has now called it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=306.0s)]
*  They have now called the race. We can call that issue one in Ohio that would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to 60 percent has gone down to a defeat, according to the Associated Press. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=310.0s)]
*  That's the news organization we're using to make the call. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=320.0s)]
*  A pretty stunning rebuke here. Not unexpected given what we've seen in the last hour. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=323.0s)]
*  But now we have an official, David. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=328.0s)]
*  I mean, this was a real there was some real hubris on the part of Republican lawmakers, the secretary of state of your state, the gerrymandered legislature to try to do this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=330.0s)]
*  Do you think there's lessons here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=340.0s)]
*  Do you think they will get the message here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=342.0s)]
*  And what is it set up for the fall? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=344.0s)]
*  I mean, they won't learn them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=346.0s)]
*  This group, my worry, whenever they lose, they double down their lawlessness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=348.0s)]
*  This is already very gerrymandered legislature. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=351.0s)]
*  I don't expect them to learn any lessons. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=354.0s)]
*  But let me just the good news here is that this is part of a longer winning streak for democracy that started last August in Kansas, included some big statehouse wins in November. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=356.0s)]
*  The Wisconsin Supreme Court race. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=366.0s)]
*  There's a pro-democracy army building in this country, and it's starting to figure out that the front line of attack on democracy are the states and the statehouses. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=368.0s)]
*  And when it sees democracy under attack in these places, this included election denying running Secretary of State Kennings. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=378.0s)]
*  It's rallying around these races. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=384.0s)]
*  And so my sort of call out to those who are doing this, keep seeing the attack for democracy is a deeper level in the state level. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=386.0s)]
*  And if you rally like we've done in all these states for the last year, we can put together one heck of a winning streak long term. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=393.0s)]
*  But we've got to focus beyond just a few federal swing states into all these states where the other side is dominated for too long. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=399.0s)]
*  Take advantage of the fact that we haven't seen the battle there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=407.0s)]
*  When we rally and we pay attention, which we did here, we can win in Kansas, Ohio, Wisconsin, you name it, because in the end, most people in America want to function in democracy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=410.0s)]
*  They don't want what the Republicans of Ohio are arrogantly trying to create here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should say we don't have the final results, but no tracking to come in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=423.0s)]
*  Double digits above the numbers of say, Democratic state candidate in the 2020 election. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be a large margin, much higher. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=434.0s)]
*  And the other lesson strikes me here just that we've seen this time and time again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=438.0s)]
*  The media focus may waver from time to time about abortion rights, but. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=444.0s)]
*  Voters have shown themselves that they will crawl over broken glass coast to coast, state to state to repudiate the Dobbs decision and the banning of abortion, the taking away of that right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=450.0s)]
*  It keeps happening, and I think it's going to keep happening a lot more tonight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=462.0s)]
*  Another turning point that Jim Miller, David Pepper, thank you very much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=465.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmxThlN1SYQ&t=479.0s)]
