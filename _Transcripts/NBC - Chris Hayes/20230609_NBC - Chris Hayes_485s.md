# Two Trump lawyers resigned following his indictment. But why?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8)
*  One of the most gripping aspects of the indictment is the tale of how one of Trump's own attorneys [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=0.0s)]
*  deftly avoided being recruited into a criminal conspiracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  On June 2, 2022, Trump attorney Evan Corcoran goes to Mar-a-Lago to review these boxes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=10.0s)]
*  And he goes there, and he's the one who's going to search the storage room, find the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=18.0s)]
*  classified documents, shun them over the government. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=22.44s)]
*  Now, what's happened in the intervening two weeks in Suspina is that Walt and – Walt [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Natta and Trump have gotten rid of the bunch of boxes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=28.96s)]
*  Corcoran goes in, passes through, he finds 38 classified documents, he puts them in a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=32.52s)]
*  folder, he binds them with clear duct tape. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=35.96s)]
*  He goes into Mar-a-Lago to meet with Donald Trump, who says, innocently, I'm sure, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=39.72s)]
*  do you find anything? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=44.28s)]
*  Is it bad? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=46.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=47.08s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=48.08s)]
*  Corcoran, they talk about what to do with the folder, and I'll read from the indictment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=49.08s)]
*  here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump and Trump attorney one then discuss what to do with the red-willed folder. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  This is the folder that has the classified documents, containing documents with classification [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=57.88s)]
*  markings and whether Trump attorney one should bring them to his hotel room, put them in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=61.32s)]
*  a safe there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=64.92s)]
*  During that conversation, Trump made a plucking motion, as memorialized by Trump attorney [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=65.92s)]
*  one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  He made a funny motion as though, well, okay, why don't you take them with you to your [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  hotel room, and if there's anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=73.68s)]
*  That was the motion he made. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=78.84s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=79.84s)]
*  So this is what happens, and this is the best part. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=81.68s)]
*  And Alex, I want to get your reaction. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=86.48s)]
*  This is not on the level. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=88.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=90.12s)]
*  And yet Corcoran is the lawyer who has to turn to the FBI and certify it's on the level. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=91.12s)]
*  So what Evan Corcoran does, which is pretty smart, Trump attorney one contacted another [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump attorney, Trump attorney three, and asked her if she would come to the Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=100.64s)]
*  Club the next morning to act as custodian of records and sign a certification regarding [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=105.72s)]
*  the search for documents with classification markings in response to the May 11th subpoena. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=110.2s)]
*  Trump attorney three, with no role in the review, agreed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=115.76s)]
*  I wrote in the margins there, Christina Bob thrown under bus. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=118.76s)]
*  That is what happened there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Although she's shielding herself from being a liability quite skillfully, that Christina [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=124.28s)]
*  Bob. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  But the story of the way in which Trump lied to his lawyers, put them in harm's way, expected [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  that they would do his dirty work is stunning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=134.16s)]
*  And it bears mentioning because there's been so much news today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=136.60000000000002s)]
*  The two lawyers, John Rowley and Jim Trusty, who were handling all of this, resigned this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=140.0s)]
*  morning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=144.36s)]
*  Well, can I just on the question of resign in Trump world, resigned, fired. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  That same thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=150.56s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=151.56s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=152.56s)]
*  Tim parlatory is on CNN all the time and MSNBC talking about this case. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=153.56s)]
*  Lindsay Halligan is left on the team. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  She has very little experience on this level at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=161.24s)]
*  And Todd Blanch is also representing Boris Epstein. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=165.02s)]
*  Evan Corcoran, who is the source of so much of this just damning material, is still representing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=167.52s)]
*  Trump in the January 16th. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  And Lawrence, this is what you get here from the Corcoran is doing memos to file. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=174.92s)]
*  It's the James Comey thing, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  Comey. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  These are lawyerly tactic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  You have a conversation with Donald Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=182.27999999999997s)]
*  You immediately go to his notes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=183.88s)]
*  Because it's like handling the fecile material. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=186.55999999999997s)]
*  It is so dangerous to be around this guy that you need to protect yourself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=189.48s)]
*  This is your client. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Protect yourself with these contemporaneous notes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=194.7s)]
*  You know, you were amused as you were describing this situation and the boxes moving around [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=196.61999999999998s)]
*  and Evan Corcoran. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=203.06s)]
*  And it is kind of funny. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=204.5s)]
*  And that continues the tone on HBO's latest version of Watergate, which is White House [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=206.7s)]
*  Plumbers, where Woody Harrelson and Paul Thoreau, Paul Thoreau playing Gordon Liddy and Woody [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=213.82s)]
*  Harrelson playing E. Howard Hunt, they're playing it for the comedy because at this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  point they can look back at that and say, look at how crazy and silly they tried to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=224.62s)]
*  break in four times, like three times before. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=229.44s)]
*  Things I didn't know that are goofy and silly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=232.9s)]
*  At the time, in the present tense, none of that was regarded as goofy or silly for one [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=236.74s)]
*  second. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=242.5s)]
*  It was dead serious. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=243.5s)]
*  This thing already plays as goofy and silly when you just see it laid out here, but also [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=244.74s)]
*  clearly very, very dangerous. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=252.3s)]
*  And incredibly damning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=255.7s)]
*  Rachel, the part of this that is different, and Ari made this point earlier and others [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=257.29999999999995s)]
*  have is the Corcoran piercing the attorney-client privilege because you tried very hard to recruit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  your lawyer into criminal conspiracy, which again, he managed to dodge, provides a window [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  into activity and conversations that happens in maybe not one out of a thousand criminal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  trials. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  You don't get the client talking to the lawyer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=284.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  And there's all these quotations in the indictment where Trump is saying, as you mentioned earlier, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  wouldn't it be better if these documents weren't there at all? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=297.3s)]
*  Do we have to hand these things over? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=299.38000000000005s)]
*  Those are the kinds of questions that you can ask your lawyer, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=302.66s)]
*  Between you and your lawyer, you can ask all sorts of dumb and incriminating sounding questions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  It's just between you and your lawyer. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=310.06s)]
*  The only reason that you should ever have those things made public beyond the relationship [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=311.5s)]
*  between you and your lawyer is if you try to engage your lawyer in the commission of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=316.46s)]
*  a crime. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=319.98s)]
*  So don't do that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=320.98s)]
*  And so it's a bad thing for us to have a window into, but we have a window into it for a very [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=321.98s)]
*  specific reason. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=327.86s)]
*  But I do have one admittedly dumb question here, and maybe Andrew Weissman is best placed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=328.86s)]
*  to answer this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=334.18s)]
*  I thought it was surprising that when we got the indictment unsealed and when we learned [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=335.78s)]
*  that Trump was indicted, also his lawyers resigned. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=340.94s)]
*  Is there anything about this indictment that says why two of his lawyers had to resign? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=343.9s)]
*  Was it an obvious consequence of this indictment? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=349.7s)]
*  What did you make of the fact that that was that those things happened and coincide? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  I thought I didn't think that it was about the substance of the charges. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  I thought there were two possible explanations. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=364.82s)]
*  One explanation is that when you are handling the investigation and you have a client who's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=369.3s)]
*  hoping not to get indicted, when the indictment comes in, the client says, thank you so much. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=376.94s)]
*  You didn't accomplish what you did. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  The client blames the lawyers, even though, of course, usually the problem is the client, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=385.14s)]
*  not the lawyers, because it's what they did that's leading this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=390.94s)]
*  So that's one possibility. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=393.54s)]
*  He's just honestly upset that they didn't do their job when they, in fact, could have. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=395.94s)]
*  The second is that once you file a notice of appearance, once you as a lawyer appear [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=401.34s)]
*  in a criminal case, not just in the investigation, but you actually say, I am representing Donald [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=408.18s)]
*  Trump in a criminal case, you cannot withdraw without court permission. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=413.74s)]
*  And a lot of times judges will say, you're in. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=419.02s)]
*  So what do people do? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=422.3s)]
*  They do something which I referred to when I was a baby prosecutor and someone said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  the defense lawyer was like, well, I'm not yet in the case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  And I was like, well, why not? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=431.3s)]
*  And he said, I'm waiting for Mr. Green. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=432.3s)]
*  And I didn't know what that meant. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  And Mr. Green is a reference to money. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's just sort of a euphemism that certainly was used in Brooklyn all the time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=440.18s)]
*  And so here you can imagine the two defense lawyers saying, look, if I'm going to stay [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mox4LTYSQa8&t=445.04s)]
