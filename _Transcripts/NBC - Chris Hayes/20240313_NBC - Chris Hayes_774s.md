# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: March 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM)
*  Joe Biden is officially the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=0.0s)]
*  His 2024 reelection campaign begins full force. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=4.4s)]
*  He will be running primarily on his record, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=7.7s)]
*  What he has gotten done with the American people over the last four years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=10.6s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=13.3s)]
*  This election's interesting and different. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=14.8s)]
*  For the first time since 1892, when President Benjamin Harrison faced a rematch against his predecessor, Grover Cleveland, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=16.8s)]
*  Biden will be running against the man who held the office just before him, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=25.0s)]
*  the man he beat, the man who didn't want to leave. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=28.8s)]
*  It sets up one of the most clear-cut apples-to-apples comparisons possible in a presidential election, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=32.0s)]
*  Usually one of the people is an incumbent, the other is just sort of like talking about what they would do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=37.5s)]
*  They don't have a record. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=41.6s)]
*  But here, in this case, you got two records to compare. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=42.9s)]
*  How is the country doing when Donald Trump was president as he catastrophically bungled the response to a once-in-a-century pandemic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=46.2s)]
*  and then left in disgrace, having fomented an unsuccessful coup and getting impeached for it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=52.8s)]
*  And how are things now, four years later, under this President Joe Biden? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=58.3s)]
*  There is quite a story to tell about the general trajectory of American life in the last four years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=63.0s)]
*  And we just so happen to have some visual aids to help tell that story. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=67.6s)]
*  We're going to show you some charts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=71.3s)]
*  And here's the thing about the charts, all right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=72.8s)]
*  Generally, you want the good stuff to go up and the bad stuff to come down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=75.0s)]
*  Okay? Pretty simple. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=81.4s)]
*  You want to see good stuff go up, bad stuff come down. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=82.8s)]
*  So this is how that looks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=85.2s)]
*  Let's just start with GDP gross domestic product. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=86.2s)]
*  That is the measure and the value of all goods and services produced in the United States, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  It's the size of the U.S. economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  And like the rest of the world, we saw a significant drop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=95.9s)]
*  See when it goes down there, the constriction, that in GDP in 2020. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=98.9s)]
*  That was the pandemic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=103.1s)]
*  That was under Donald Trump's watch. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  But just look at the recovery in the four years since. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  Look at that go up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=109.2s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. had the strongest recovery of all of its peers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=110.7s)]
*  Every country faced similar headwoods and challenges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=115.4s)]
*  Last year, our economy grew faster than any other nation in the G7. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  And when you zoom in a little further, now showing only the Biden years, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  it's essentially a straight line going up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=126.7s)]
*  That was not foreordained. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  A lot could have gone wrong. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=131.1s)]
*  It's hard to pick yourself back up from the once in a century pandemic and the disruptions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=132.3s)]
*  We've seen this growth now reflected in the stock market. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=137.0s)]
*  Again, start low, go high, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=139.5s)]
*  Four years ago, Dow plunged. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=141.8s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=143.7s)]
*  Recording its worst ever drop in a single day on March 16th, 2020, almost exactly four years ago. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=144.1s)]
*  Under President Donald Trump, he was obsessed with the stock market. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=149.6s)]
*  Four years later, not only is it back on track, it hit an all-time record high at the end of last month. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Once again, over the past year, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  From here to there, getting better. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, there's a bunch of reasons for this really remarkable economic performance and growth in this era, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=166.2s)]
*  the Biden era, last few years. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=172.5s)]
*  Jobs have really bounced back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=174.1s)]
*  Labor force participation rate, that's the percentage of people who are in the labor force, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=175.9s)]
*  really increasing steadily from the COVID era lows, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=180.1s)]
*  It hit lows during the pandemic and then it goes up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=182.8s)]
*  New business applications. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=186.8s)]
*  This is people starting businesses, which is, you know, the American dream. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=188.4s)]
*  In 2023 alone, Americans filed five and a half million new business applications. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=192.0s)]
*  That was a record high for the year. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=196.1s)]
*  In fact, that was the third year in a row of record breaking applications for a total of 16 million [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=198.9s)]
*  over the first three years of Biden administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=204.8s)]
*  Starts down here, goes up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=206.8s)]
*  Manufacturing is also booming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=209.5s)]
*  Thanks to a flurry of Biden signed legislation, more and more goods being produced in America again, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=211.8s)]
*  bringing good paying manufacturing jobs back into the U.S. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  See? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=222.4s)]
*  See how that goes? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Hospitality jobs in particular have bounced back after plummeting after the pandemic. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=225.0s)]
*  Again, not a given the industry will recover fully post-COVID. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=230.5s)]
*  You see it go down here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=234.9s)]
*  But travels back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=237.1s)]
*  We can see from the number of passengers flying on U.S. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=238.4s)]
*  Airlines when Joe, this is the summer of 2020, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=241.6s)]
*  In the depths up to now July 2023 across the board. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=244.6s)]
*  And this is key. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=250.0s)]
*  Wages are rising, rising fast inflation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=251.3s)]
*  I mean wages rising in real terms. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=253.9s)]
*  Okay, workers now make an average of more than $34 an hour. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=257.2s)]
*  Earnings are outpacing inflation crucially. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=260.7s)]
*  That means there is more money in Americans pockets to spend. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=264.3s)]
*  Disposable personal income. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=268.2s)]
*  This is one of the most important charts here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=270.5s)]
*  Took a huge hit when COVID support ended and inflation spiked. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=272.5s)]
*  It was really bad on people's balance sheets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=275.6s)]
*  Now it's on the right track. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=278.5s)]
*  This is the last two years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=280.6s)]
*  Having significantly increased in the last two years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=281.8s)]
*  From down here to up there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=285.0s)]
*  Another thing we're doing in the last four years, we are producing more of our own energy here in the U.S. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Crude oil production. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=293.3s)]
*  Basically no one in America knows this so listen closely. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  Crude oil production under Democratic President Joe Biden broke records last year. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  It is outpacing projections so far in 2024. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=303.1s)]
*  In fact, we're producing right now more oil than any other nation ever has at any time ever. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=306.1s)]
*  Now you might say as I do when I say that sentence from a climate perspective, not great, which true. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=313.3s)]
*  But crucially also renewable power is booming. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=319.1s)]
*  Renewable power generation is also up amid President Biden's $370 billion investment in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=323.7s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=333.5s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=334.3s)]
*  Remember they named it that? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=335.0s)]
*  Not necessarily because it was an inflation bill but because of this chart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=336.4s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  This is the whole story of the last four years in some way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=341.4s)]
*  It's the reason I think that Joe Biden's faced political headwinds. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=345.0s)]
*  This is also the story in every other country on earth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  Inflation has had a rocky ride since the pandemic and the massive supply chain interruptions it brought. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  The consumer price index. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=358.0s)]
*  That's the measurement, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  Measurement of change in the average price of goods and services hit 9% in the summer of 2022 right there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  And that was bad. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=368.5s)]
*  It caused severe financial strain for people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  And crucially, this is a global phenomenon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=372.5s)]
*  Happened basically everywhere. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=374.6s)]
*  But look at this since then, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  It has come way down. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  It's now hovering at 3%. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  Again, this was not guaranteed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=381.3s)]
*  If you go read the economic press back here, people are like we're going to need a recession or it's going to keep going up forever or we're screwed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  Or we're walking the catastrophe. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=390.3s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  It has come down to 3% and like economic growth, this is better than basically any of our peer countries. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=393.5s)]
*  They would all trade places to be us. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=401.3s)]
*  The unemployment rate has also dropped massively after hitting an unprecedented spike of nearly 15% in 2020, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=403.7s)]
*  The same story in the chart. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=410.6s)]
*  Bad things happen in 2020 and then they get better after Donald Trump leaves office. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=412.1s)]
*  Over the past couple of years, the Biden presidency, unemployment has actually been hovering below 4% for an unprecedentedly long period of time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=418.6s)]
*  In the past year, amid all these economic improvements, mortgage rates, which have risen quite a bit as the Federal Reserve hiked rates, have started coming down as well, which is welcome. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=427.8s)]
*  We're seeing gas prices drop. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=439.0s)]
*  Remember? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=440.70000000000005s)]
*  Remember this story from a spike in nearly $5 per gallon the summer of 2022, people going around putting on their Joe Biden stickers on gas pumps saying I did that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=441.70000000000005s)]
*  You don't see that so much anymore because we're now down to a little over $3 per gallon. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  They start up here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=455.1s)]
*  They go down there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=456.1s)]
*  And finally, and this is the one conservatives love to get wrong, one we're obsessed with here on the show. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=458.6s)]
*  There has been a big decrease in violent crime under President Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=463.5s)]
*  2020 was one of the most dangerous years in America in decade under Donald Trump. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=468.7s)]
*  Violent crime spiked around the country. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=473.9s)]
*  It spiked in both urban and rural areas. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=475.5s)]
*  But in every year, the Biden administration violent crime has come down. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=477.9s)]
*  In fact, according to the latest estimates, 2023 is on track to have one of the lowest violent crime rates in half a century. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=482.7s)]
*  So compared to four years ago when Donald Trump was president, these are just the facts. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=490.8s)]
*  OK, the country is safer. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=495.09999999999997s)]
*  It is more prosperous. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=496.9s)]
*  It is more energy independent. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=498.2s)]
*  There are more people working and making higher wages, more people starting new businesses, more people working in manufacturing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=499.8s)]
*  The last year of the last president's term of Donald Trump's term was a nightmare. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=508.2s)]
*  And because it was a nightmare, it's easy to block out. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=514.8s)]
*  But look how far the country's come. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=517.6s)]
*  This is what has been achieved under President Joe Biden. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=519.8s)]
*  And it is the pitch you can expect him to be making to voters all this year. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=524.3s)]
*  So it's been a few days since the Republican response to the State of the Union. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=530.3s)]
*  By now, the performance of Senator Katie Britt has been roasted and panned by Democrats, Republicans, SNL, pretty much everyone. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=533.4s)]
*  But beyond the spectacle of it, there is a very serious story of misinformation she included that night. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=542.0s)]
*  Now she's being called out for it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=547.8s)]
*  In the speech, if you recall, Britt took the horrible, incredibly graphic and disturbing story of a Mexican sex trafficking survivor from 20 years ago in Guadalajara in the interior of Mexico and tried to blame Joe Biden's current border policy for it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=550.4s)]
*  Britt was roundly criticized by journalists and by the survivor herself. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=567.6s)]
*  In fact, I hardly ever cooperate with politicians because it seems to me that they only want an image. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  I think she should first take into account what really happens before telling a story of that magnitude. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=579.2s)]
*  That was Carla Jacinto Romero with good advice that Republicans absolutely refused to take her story, her horrible story appropriated by Katie Britt. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=585.5s)]
*  The twisted claims were wildly and grossly misleading. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=595.2s)]
*  She implied it was happening in the U.S. now because of Biden's border policy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=598.2s)]
*  But here's the thing. That's gotten a lot of attention. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=604.1s)]
*  It's dime a dozen when it comes to right wing immigrant fear mongering. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=606.5s)]
*  Remember this guy? Remember him? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=611.2s)]
*  He's a migrant from Venezuela named John Buada. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=613.4s)]
*  He was the focus of the right wing media's hate last month after he was accused of being part of a gang that attacked NYPD officers in Times Square. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=617.6s)]
*  And then he was subsequently photographed flipping the bird while leaving court. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=626.4s)]
*  And to be clear, when I saw that image and this story break earlier this year, I thought if I were a Fox producer or worked the New York Post, I'd be running with this. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=630.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm a bleeding heart liberal and even I found this image provocative, let's say. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=639.7s)]
*  So did actual Fox producers who covered Buada in at least, get this, 84 segments over 38 days, according to Media Matters. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=644.2s)]
*  We're caught on tape. Given the middle finger as they waltzed out of jail. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=655.0s)]
*  He's being let out of court yesterday on bail and he gives America, the press, everybody there, the double bird. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=659.0s)]
*  So let me get this straight. He strolls across the border, was given free shelter, beat up cops and suffered no consequences. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  And this is how he thanks us. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=672.6999999999999s)]
*  This guy coming out and flipping off the camera. Really, what are you doing? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=674.6s)]
*  And he's flipping off all of America. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=679.3s)]
*  The Hayfest even went from Fox News to a political ad cut by a pro-Trump super PAC. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=682.4s)]
*  But then this month, guess what happened? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=688.9s)]
*  Manhattan prosecutors dropped the charges against Buada. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=692.0s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=694.9s)]
*  They told the judge that further investigation proved that Buada, that guy who had always professed his innocence, did not participate in the attack in question. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=696.1s)]
*  They misidentified him. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=707.8s)]
*  It wasn't him. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=708.9s)]
*  They got the wrong guy. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=709.6999999999999s)]
*  Not him. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=711.1s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=711.8s)]
*  Have you seen coverage of that? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=714.0s)]
*  You think they've run 84 segments on Fox News about that? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=716.0s)]
*  Of course, by then the man's life is upended. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=718.9s)]
*  The myth of migrant crime had already become a roar on the right-wing media machine and they will do it over and over again. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=721.6999999999999s)]
*  Whether it's false rumors of a migrant caravan about to destroy America or the guardian angels live on Fox, wailing on a man they claimed was a migrant thief when he was neither. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=727.6999999999999s)]
*  He was an American for the Bronx who hadn't stolen anything. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=737.9s)]
*  That happened last month. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  Remember all of this the next time you hear an immigration horror story out of Republicans. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=743.6s)]
*  Aiming for fear, not facts. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=750.6s)]
*  You [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wML-Qsa0spM&t=772.6s)]
