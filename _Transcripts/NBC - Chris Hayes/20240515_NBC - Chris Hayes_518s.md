# Bible-loving Mike Johnson attends Trump 'porn star mistress' trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Alicia Menendez in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=0.0s)]
*  While star witness Michael Cohen testified against Donald Trump at his New York trial [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  yesterday, the former president was joined by quite the entourage of defenders. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=7.96s)]
*  Now, according to reporting from Rolling Stone, quote, in the early days of the trial, the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=12.56s)]
*  former president was infuriated by the lack of visible support from his allies at the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=16.68s)]
*  courthouse. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=21.68s)]
*  Where are they, he complained earlier this month? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=22.68s)]
*  Well, Trump's allies, they now appear to have heard those complaints loud and clear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=25.0s)]
*  They showed up in full force in downtown Manhattan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=29.92s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump received visible support from multiple members of his family, his son [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=32.64s)]
*  Eric, along with daughter in law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Laura, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  as well as a who's who of Republican politicians. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=41.64s)]
*  The surrogates included former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=44.6s)]
*  congressman Cory Mills and Byron Donalds, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, and even Speaker [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=50.08s)]
*  of the House Mike Johnson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=55.88s)]
*  Donald's entourage was united in their message as they all spoke to the cameras. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=58.32s)]
*  All of us are here as friends of Donald Trump, supporting him in our personal capacity. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=63.76s)]
*  President Trump is innocent of these charges. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  The American people have already acquitted Donald Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=71.44s)]
*  The judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=74.48s)]
*  This trial is a joke. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=78.8s)]
*  This thing is a farce. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=80.76s)]
*  There's no crime here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=82.0s)]
*  Where's the crime? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=83.2s)]
*  There is no crime. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=84.32s)]
*  It's so corrupt and everybody knows it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=85.32s)]
*  Trump surrogates also used their time at the microphone to level more personal attacks [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=87.84s)]
*  against Michael Cohen, a witness, even Judge Juan Marchand's family. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=91.64s)]
*  Of course, they were saying what Trump himself cannot because he is currently under a gag [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=95.56s)]
*  order. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=99.76s)]
*  We're going to talk more about that later in the show. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=100.76s)]
*  But the other clear intention of the Trump gang was to bring the campaign to the courthouse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=102.84s)]
*  Several of the surrogates were obviously auditioning for vice president with Ramaswamy, Donalds [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=107.92s)]
*  and Burgum, all reportedly under consideration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=112.28s)]
*  The entire group in coordinating outfits, a dark suit and a red tie, even recorded a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=115.82s)]
*  fundraising plea for Trump's campaign, led by Laura Trump and posted to her social media [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  account. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  We're here in court with President Trump standing with them, but we need you to stand with them [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=131.7s)]
*  Go to DonaldJTrump.com, support President Trump in his efforts to win this election. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=132.7s)]
*  These Democrats are nuts and they must be defeated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=136.94s)]
*  Anything you can give would make a world of difference. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=139.5s)]
*  We are here fighting the good fight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=142.38s)]
*  They cannot win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=144.14s)]
*  We need your help to make America great again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=145.62s)]
*  Let's make America great again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=148.06s)]
*  And he's the man to do it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=150.06s)]
*  So while Trump's entourage may have provided some moral support, politics was clearly their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=154.38s)]
*  main purpose. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=159.54s)]
*  I'm joined now by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=160.54s)]
*  Congressman, first, your impression of the political support you saw for the former president [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=164.62s)]
*  this week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=168.86s)]
*  Well, you know, they're all attracted to the Mecca of the courthouse in order to demonstrate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=170.3s)]
*  their complete obeisance and sycophantcy to Donald Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=176.58s)]
*  And I think it's a good thing that they are identifying themselves, the people who have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=182.94000000000003s)]
*  completely allowed Donald Trump to devour their critical thinking skills and their political [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=187.62s)]
*  and moral independence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=193.3s)]
*  I mean, Speaker Johnson is a guy who has said that the Bible is his guiding document and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=194.74s)]
*  is basically the law of the land. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  And yet he's made the pilgrimage to New York to demonstrate, you know, how obsequious [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  he can be to Donald Trump, a guy who is now an adjudicated rapist, an adjudicated fraudster [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=209.74s)]
*  in New York. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  He's on trial for cooking the books for lots of money in order to cover up hush money [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=218.34s)]
*  payments to his porn star mistress. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=225.66s)]
*  So you know, I'm a member of the Free Thought Caucus, and we've been saying all along [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=229.82s)]
*  that Speaker Johnson's adherence to religion is just a form of political tribalism. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=235.54s)]
*  It doesn't have anything to do with religious principle, and now he's showing the whole [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  world that that's true. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  Especially interesting, since he is not on that list, what I would call a long list, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=247.06s)]
*  not a short list of potential VP picks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  How is the fact that you have all of these sitting members of Congress traveling to New [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=254.34s)]
*  York to do Donald Trump's political bidding impacting the workflow of the U.S. House of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=258.7s)]
*  Representatives? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I know that they have to move one farce, which is the scheduled hearing and markup [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  session about holding Attorney General Garland in contempt for actually complying with their [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=274.58s)]
*  order and turning over the complete transcript of Donald Trump's interview with special [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=280.38s)]
*  counsel Herr. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=287.18s)]
*  Now they've decided that's not enough. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=288.42s)]
*  They don't just want the verbatim transcript. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=289.78s)]
*  They want the audio tape. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=292.58s)]
*  And in order to salvage their completely discredited and humiliating impeachment voyage, they're [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=294.14s)]
*  trying to hold Merrick Garland in contempt. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=301.02s)]
*  Well, that was scheduled for 11 a.m. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=303.3s)]
*  tomorrow. And we just got notice it's been moved to 8 p.m. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  because a bunch of members of the majority in the Oversight Committee are traveling to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=307.94000000000005s)]
*  New York so they can soothe Donald Trump's wounded feelings that nobody was there to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  support him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=317.38000000000005s)]
*  As you said, one farce crowding out the other. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=318.5s)]
*  So all of this, right, that they're standing in front of the courtroom, they're doing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=321.18s)]
*  fundraising appeals from inside the courthouse, all in the service of a second Trump term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=324.54s)]
*  When we talk about the potential dangers of that possibility, there was reporting in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  The Washington Post about a Mar-a-Lago dinner where the former president, he promised to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=333.38s)]
*  ease regulations on the oil industry while asking executives to steer one billion dollars [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=337.26s)]
*  to his campaign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  You have now opened an investigation into that dinner. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  Which details are you hoping to gather and how do you establish that as a quid pro quo? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=345.62s)]
*  Well, it's just amazing how explicit all of this is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  He's basically saying to the oil and gas execs, pony up a billion dollars, which will [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=357.18s)]
*  go in some part to his campaign, but mostly probably to his lawyers and his legal expenses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=362.5s)]
*  And who knows how much of it makes its way back to the Trump family. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=369.02s)]
*  But in any event, he's saying, give me a billion dollars and I'm going to reverse the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=372.5s)]
*  Biden administration's actions on liquefied natural gas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=378.5s)]
*  I'm going to blow the roof off the house in terms of allowing you to drill wherever [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=382.5s)]
*  you want to drill and so on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=388.86s)]
*  And everybody knows where Donald Trump stands, but it's almost as if he wants to walk right [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=391.66s)]
*  up to the line of criminal bribery and state what the quid pro quo is. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=396.38s)]
*  Obviously, there can be no criminal or civil action before the election. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=401.86s)]
*  I mean, look at the trials that are taking place now based on things that transpired [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=405.9s)]
*  several years ago. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  But at least the public can see this for what it is. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=412.5s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is saying at events, if you want to come up and make a speech, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=416.5s)]
*  give me a million dollars. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=420.86s)]
*  I'll let you do it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=421.86s)]
*  And people said, yes, two people jumped up on that stage, Congressman. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=422.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=428.1s)]
*  And that in itself might be a campaign finance violation. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  Again, we've got a kind of dysfunctional arrangement at the FEC because the Republicans [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=432.98s)]
*  blockade any action. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, he asked for a million dollars, which is more when you add it up than all [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=439.54s)]
*  of the different elements he could actually be soliciting for. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=445.34s)]
*  But again, I don't want to place too much faith in the legal system, the campaign finance [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=449.06s)]
*  regime. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=454.66s)]
*  I'm putting my faith in the people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=455.66s)]
*  The people have got to understand what's going on. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=456.86s)]
*  We've got two completely contrasting schools of thought about what government is. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zWOuCRfgg&t=459.1s)]
