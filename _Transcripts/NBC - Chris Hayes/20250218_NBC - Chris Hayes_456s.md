# Trump says AP is banned from White House until they use 'Gulf of America'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E)
*  For over 175 years, the Associated Press has been one of the single most vital organizations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=0.0s)]
*  for informing Americans about their world, their country, and their government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=5.58s)]
*  And Donald Trump and his White House have banned them from the Oval Office and now also [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  from Air Force One, all because the AP has not followed Trump's orders in referring to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=14.02s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico solely as the Gulf of America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=19.88s)]
*  According to the widely used AP Stylebook, which is an arbiter of language and usage [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  around the world and often used by journalists, the body of water remains the Gulf of Mexico [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=28.8s)]
*  with a reference to Trump's order to call it the Gulf of America. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=34.28s)]
*  Today Trump was finally asked to defend the AP's White House ban. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=38.88s)]
*  The Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what is taking place. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=43.52s)]
*  It's called the Gulf of America now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  It's not called the Gulf of Mexico any longer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=52.56s)]
*  I just say that we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=54.84s)]
*  Gulf of America. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=58.32s)]
*  We're very proud of this country and we want it to be the Gulf of America. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=59.32s)]
*  Now the Associated Press, as you know, has been very, very wrong on the election, on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=62.88s)]
*  Trump and the treatment of Trump and other things having to do with Trump and Republicans [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  and conservatives. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=74.5s)]
*  And they're doing us no favors. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=76.6s)]
*  And I guess I'm not doing them any favors. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=78.2s)]
*  That's the way life works. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  No, that's not the way life works in a democracy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=81.4s)]
*  The press does not exist to do the government or the president favors. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=84.16s)]
*  The press exists to hold the government and the president to account. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=87.14s)]
*  Press freedoms in the United States are at risk. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Just one of the many threats that Donald Trump poses to American democracy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=93.5s)]
*  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic Senator of Missouri. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=97.78s)]
*  Tim Miller is the former spokesperson for the RNC, now a writer at large for the Bullwork. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=100.3s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  Great to see you both. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=105.82s)]
*  Claire McCaskill, that is deeply, deeply offensive. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=106.82s)]
*  And that's something for Donald Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=109.14s)]
*  The concept that that's the way it works, that the Associated Press or any of us should [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=111.7s)]
*  be under any rules dictated by the president of the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're seeing some scary stuff, especially around the First Amendment and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=121.78s)]
*  the rule of law. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=126.46s)]
*  We're seeing a few people stand up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing a few people do the right thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  But many of them are lawyers who have an ethical requirement to behave a certain way or they [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=133.66s)]
*  lose their license to practice law, like Rudy Giuliani has lost his. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=139.54s)]
*  So I would like to see some of the people that are elected to office, that have an [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=144.98s)]
*  R behind their name, show the same courage that some of these lying prosecutors have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  shown in the Department of Justice. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=153.5s)]
*  And frankly, I'd like to see other news outlets stand up in unity against what Donald Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  is doing to the AP. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=161.5s)]
*  Tim, what's your take on this part of this nonsense that we're seeing? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=162.78s)]
*  It is, Donald Trump's kind of just making up rules, but it was very chilling that he [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=167.94s)]
*  makes up rules about what the press must do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=173.82s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=177.06s)]
*  Rules that are not true. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=178.66s)]
*  Yeah, two thoughts on this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=179.66s)]
*  Well, one, it's pretty ominous. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=181.66s)]
*  And some of this is just ridiculous and silly, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=183.66s)]
*  Like the press secretary saying that this is the Gulf of America. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=186.38s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=190.3s)]
*  Like some of this could be out of a farcical movie. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=191.3s)]
*  But it's pretty ominous when the president of the United States is saying that the AP [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=193.46s)]
*  isn't following the law. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=197.22s)]
*  Like, that's what he used the word that he used in that clip, the law, as if he can mandate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=198.22s)]
*  what people call bodies of water and declare that to be a legally binding rule put in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  place by the president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=210.62s)]
*  I just thought that's not how things work. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=211.62s)]
*  Obviously, everybody watching this knows that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  But it is pretty chilling to think that that is how the sitting president wants things [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  to work and is trying to make things work. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=222.62s)]
*  So and that's the first element that's showing to me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=224.5s)]
*  The other thing to Claire's point about the other media outlets standing together, this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=227.22s)]
*  is a tricky situation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  And I think it's pretty clarifying about the right wing media and the mega media, because [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=233.02s)]
*  when Fox was kicked out of the pool during the Obama era, the mainstream, NBC, the network, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=236.5s)]
*  CBS, ABC, stood in solidarity with Fox. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=243.18s)]
*  You're not seeing any of that from the mega media now standing in solidarity with the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=246.5s)]
*  AP. And unfortunately, for the other mainstream outlets, you can stand with AP, but like [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=250.86s)]
*  boycotting probably doesn't do you any good because the Trump smite just kick you out of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  the pool altogether. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=261.94s)]
*  So I think it's a tricky situation for the other mainstream media outlets. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=263.58s)]
*  Yeah, Tim made an allusion to something that Donald Trump again said today, an implication [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=269.02s)]
*  that Donald Trump and the attorney general determine what the law is, determine what's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=274.86s)]
*  legal and what's not legal might sound interesting to people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=279.86s)]
*  Again, Claire, it's it's you're a United States senator. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=283.74s)]
*  That's just not actually true. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=287.14s)]
*  It's just not actually true. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=289.18s)]
*  And I'll tell you who gets to decide what the law is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=290.82s)]
*  The courts get to decide that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  And this is going to be a presidency that is written about in terms of court cases. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=295.62s)]
*  There are going to be so many court cases that it's going to be as difficult to keep [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=302.14s)]
*  track of them as a nonsensical BS that comes out of the overall office. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  And you're going to see a bunch of them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=310.26s)]
*  And these lawyers that have resigned know that judges are going to be looking over the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=312.14s)]
*  shoulder of the decisions of some of these folks that are doing Trump's bidding. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=316.42s)]
*  And the courts are going to determine what the law is, whether Donald Trump likes it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=321.42s)]
*  or not. Tim, one of the I guess these are abstractions to some people, right, whether [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=325.14000000000004s)]
*  it's called the Gulf of America or the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=330.62s)]
*  But some of the things that are going on in the government are not abstractions. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=332.74s)]
*  There's been a U.S. judge has temporarily halted the firing of seven of 11 CIA officials. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=335.62s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that they accidentally fired officials working [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=341.22s)]
*  on bird flu and they're trying to get them back. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=345.06s)]
*  Same thing with a nuclear protection site. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=347.62s)]
*  They've apparently overfired people and they're you know, they're worried about safety [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=349.66s)]
*  issues. At some point, this is going to for some Americans not be an abstraction. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=353.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, it already is not an abstraction, certainly for all of the federal employees [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=359.7s)]
*  who have lost jobs, who did not get unfired, you know, and that includes people in the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=364.98s)]
*  Veterans Administration. You know, it's not just nothing against random bureaucrats [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  sitting in offices in Washington, D.C., but it's not just random bureaucrats sitting in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=374.98s)]
*  offices in D.C. You know, we've seen at the VA and USDA people have jobs out across the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=378.74s)]
*  country, people that were, you know, serving abroad at USAID, including Christians, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=385.58000000000004s)]
*  evangelical Christians who think that was part of their commitment to serve the least [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=392.06s)]
*  fortunate throughout the world. So there are a lot of people who have already lost jobs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  I do also think that there will be medium to long term ramifications, you know, whether [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=399.42s)]
*  that be in the food safety or the infectious disease or the FAA or the FAA firings, like who [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=403.74s)]
*  can predict. But certainly it's going to get real for people quite soon. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=409.98s)]
*  Yeah. And Claire, it is one of those issues where we are going to need to convince Americans [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  about the value of these civil servants. The system has worked so well that people, it's a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=421.02s)]
*  background app, right? You just don't know that they're doing their jobs. But when your planes [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=426.62s)]
*  don't crash into each other, your checks arrive on time. It's because the government is doing its work. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=430.14000000000004s)]
*  Thanks to both of you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiHbZ7nj1E&t=435.14000000000004s)]
