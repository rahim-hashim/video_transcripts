# Trump loses latest bid to halt sentencing in hush money case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA)
*  Donald Trump just lost his latest attempt to wriggle out of his hush money conviction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=0.0s)]
*  He had filed for an emergency stay of his scheduled sentencing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=5.0s)]
*  His lawyer is arguing he's already protected by a presidential immunity. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=9.0s)]
*  Prosecutors countered. There's no basis for that argument, as there's only one president at a time, and he is not president yet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=12.0s)]
*  Today, after hearing from both sides, a New York appellate judge denied Trump's bid for a stay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=18.0s)]
*  He's scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts this Friday, just 10 days before he takes the oath of office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=23.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent who's been following this closely, and she joins me now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=29.0s)]
*  So the Trump argument was, so Judge Murchon said, I want to sentence you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=33.0s)]
*  He already said, I'm not going to give you any time or fines or anything, so don't worry. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=37.0s)]
*  We're not going to saddle the incoming president with some burden. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=42.0s)]
*  We're not going to have to solve for some law school exam type of hypothetical. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=46.0s)]
*  Can he be in inauguration jail? We're not doing any of that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=50.0s)]
*  Trump's people argued it should be stayed. Why? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=54.0s)]
*  They argued it should be stayed for reasons of presidential immunity and sort of twofold. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=57.0s)]
*  They said, first of all, the conviction should have been vacated because it was predicated on evidence that came about through his term of office. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=61.0s)]
*  And therefore, that's the official acts, not the signing of the checks per se, but conversations with Hope Hicks, the tweets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=68.0s)]
*  That's official acts evidence. But they also then tried to apply this sort of sitting president immunity from all prosecutions to the transition period, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=74.0s)]
*  sort of moving it backwards, applying this ever elastic theory of presidential immunity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=82.0s)]
*  And that's where Judge Gessmer or Justice Gessmer of the Appellate Division today said, Mr. Blanche, what precedent is there for applying presidential immunity to a president in transition? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=86.0s)]
*  He said, Your Honor, there is none. There's never been a case like this. But she wasn't exactly satisfied by that either. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. Although, you know, we we made up this for cocked immunity argument before it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=102.0s)]
*  I wanted the Supreme Court. So like, why not keep generating more for cocked immunity arguments? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=107.0s)]
*  Although at some point, the elastic is going to snap back. And I think they really have to be careful here because at some point, the Supreme Court is going to say to them, it may not be on this instance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=113.0s)]
*  Right. They're going to say at some point, this is not what we intended. You are reading our decision far beyond even the breadth of this decision. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=121.0s)]
*  It's Tuesday night. Yeah. Friday's the date. What I just refuse to believe it's going to happen on Friday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=129.0s)]
*  Not for any legal reason, just pure experience like, yeah, if past is prologue. Right. So they're going to try to make this not happen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=135.0s)]
*  They can appeal to the Court of Appeals. That's right. New York State. Confusingly, it's the highest court. It's called the Court of Appeals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=143.0s)]
*  I guess they could try some federal judge injunction. Hail Mary. Some federal judge. That's what I originally thought they were going to do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=149.0s)]
*  They have a pending federal appeal on the issue of whether or not this should have been removed to federal court in the first place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=156.0s)]
*  OK, that's a case that's not yet right for oral argument. The DA's office has a brief due next week, but they could effectively try to hinge it on that and ask the Second Circuit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=161.0s)]
*  That's the federal court of appeals for New York, Connecticut and Vermont to stay or issue even a writ of mandamus preventing Judge Marchand from proceeding with the sentencing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=171.0s)]
*  And then, of course, if all else fails, they have their friends at the United States Supreme Court and they could try with them as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little emergency rocket docket situation over there. There was another bit of legal news today that I saw and literally didn't understand. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=187.0s)]
*  I was like, am I reading a Mad Libs right now, which was Judge Aileen Cannon, federal district judge in Florida, who, of course, has been extremely favorable to Donald Trump in the documents case there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=194.0s)]
*  Telling the federal government, Jack Smith, he couldn't issue a report on what Donald Trump did. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=205.0s)]
*  And I was like, wait, why is that even? How can she do that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=211.0s)]
*  So let's start with let's start with the premise that the special counsel is required under the existing regulations to turn in a report to the attorney general at the completion of their work required by law in the statute that creates. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=214.0s)]
*  Well, in the regulations, the regulations are the same regulations that Judge Cannon already found are invalid under the Constitution. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=226.0s)]
*  And she dismissed the case on that grounds. So last night, Trump's lawyers went to Judge Cannon and said, you should stay the release of any special counsel report. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=233.0s)]
*  They hours later went to the 11th Circuit. That's the federal court of appeals for that area. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=242.0s)]
*  Ask the same thing. And Judge Cannon, without even hearing substantively from the Department of Justice, said, yes, I will grant you that stay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=247.0s)]
*  And I will temporarily enjoin the Department of Justice, Jack Smith's office and anybody who works with or for those two people from not only releasing the report, but also disseminating any information contained in that report. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=255.0s)]
*  And that's an order, Chris, of extraordinary breath, because just think about it this way. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=268.0s)]
*  If I'm the 11th Circuit, I can't even ask the lawyers of the Department of Justice to tell me what's in the report privately. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=273.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. Well, Aileen Cannon, man, doing her thing. You know, I guess I guess it's worked out for her so far. We'll see if that continues. Lisa Rubin, thank you very much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=279.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfkuLib7oKA&t=309.0s)]
