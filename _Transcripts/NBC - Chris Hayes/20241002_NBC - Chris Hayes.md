# Maddow reacts to new Jack Smith evidence against Trump 'Sent a chill down my spine’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ)
*  That point about the sort of drama in the document and the sort of and the narrative arc of it, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  specifically the pressure on Pence, which comes through in the January 6 committee report a bit, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=6.16s)]
*  and it is really a focus here that, you know, on January 5th, the defendant told Pence, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=10.96s)]
*  I think you have the power to decertify. When Pence was unmoved, the defendant threatened to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=15.52s)]
*  criticize him publicly, which again, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. We know what that means. I'm going [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=19.52s)]
*  to have to say you did a great disservice. And then this timing, it's possible again, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=23.52s)]
*  it's easy to lose track of what has been entered into the public record and what hasn't, Rachel, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=30.08s)]
*  but this timing of that tweet, and we played you, I think that's Nick Fuentes, the notorious [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Nazi who dined with the president in the bullhorn reading out about Pence not doing what he's called [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=40.96s)]
*  to do. At 2.24 p.m., Trump was alone in the dining room when he issued a tweet attacking [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=46.0s)]
*  Pence and fueling the ongoing riot. Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=50.64s)]
*  been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=57.6s)]
*  previously certify. USA demands the truth. And then Jack Smith writes, one minute later, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=62.64s)]
*  at 2.25 p.m., the Secret Service was forced to evacuate Pence to a secure location. Rachel, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=69.12s)]
*  it doesn't quite say cause and effect, but it just lays the cause and the effect right there [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  next to each other in adjacent sentences. There's so much detail that they are presenting about that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=81.28s)]
*  tweet and the context of it. They go to great lengths and great detail to explain that Trump [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=88.72s)]
*  was alone in the dining room off the Oval Office when he sent it. They go to great lengths to say [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  that, yes, there was another staffer who did have the, was sort of cleared to tweet in Trump's name, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=100.88s)]
*  but he did not do that tweet. They go to great lengths to show that at the time that Trump sent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=108.32s)]
*  that tweet while he was alone and nobody else was there, it was definitely him who did it, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=113.6s)]
*  he was both watching Fox News, which had already reported at that point and was continually [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=118.0s)]
*  reporting that the Capitol had been breached, that the rioters had made their way inside [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=123.2s)]
*  Congress where Mike Pence was. He was also watching Twitter where it was being reported [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=128.48s)]
*  in real time. I mean, they are saying, they go through all of those details, like it was him [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=132.72s)]
*  and this is what he knew when he did it, and then they establish, you know, some of the other things [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=138.0s)]
*  that he tweeted around the election and around January 6th, arguably under the Supreme Court's, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=142.72s)]
*  you know, rules around these things could be construed as official actions. When he did [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=148.32s)]
*  send statements in a sort of milquetoast way that said people should go home in peace and love, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=152.32s)]
*  that was a kind of presidential thing to do. He was acting on the institutional [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=156.8s)]
*  interest of the US government. Presidential-ish. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=160.72s)]
*  But when he said Mike Pence, yes, but when he said Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=162.4s)]
*  needed to be done, there's nothing presidential about it. There is no way that this could be [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=168.24s)]
*  construed as doing anything other than advancing his personal, private, criminal interest in that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  moment. They just cover every single angle of it in a way that I, it just feels like a straight jacket. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=178.0s)]
*  There's also something, I mean, you made this mention before, Rachel, I mean, and we were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=184.72s)]
*  sitting together, Lawrence, on the day of that immunity, both oral arguments and decision. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=189.44s)]
*  You know, this effort basically, a largely successful effort in certain ways, aided by [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court, right, to make all this just disappear down the memory hole, right? As we sit [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  here 34 days from an election, in which we all know, everyone who covers this, everyone in politics, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, across the ideological spectrum, understands that he's going to try [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=209.28s)]
*  to do the same thing again. That's obviously a certainty, right? And so this part, which seemed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=212.64s)]
*  relevant today, and particularly relevant after your very funny line last night about [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  JD Vance being the first vice presidential nominee not to know who won the previous election, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=223.76s)]
*  this, the defendant and his co-conspirators also demonstrated their deliberate disregard for the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  truth when they repeatedly changed the numbers. I love this, changed the numbers in their baseless [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=234.48s)]
*  fraud allegations from day to day. The conspirators started with the allegation that 36,000 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=240.8s)]
*  non-citizens voted in Arizona. Five days later, it was beyond credulity that a few hundred thousand [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=247.68s)]
*  didn't vote. Three weeks later, the bare minimum was 40 or 50,000. So the timing of this, less than [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=252.72s)]
*  24 hours after we saw JD Vance on the debate stage, unable to answer the question of did Donald Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=259.44s)]
*  lose the election? And JD Vance having publicly already said he would not have done what Mike Pence [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=267.84s)]
*  did. He would have done exactly. Donald Trump would only have to ask him once. In fact, might not even [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  have to ask him. He might do it proactively. And so, and then for this document to emerge today, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  where the star of today's document is Mike Pence, because he hasn't been in anything else we've been [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=285.12s)]
*  able to read. So this really is Mike Pence's moment in this story today. And every single step [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=292.24s)]
*  of this story that Mike Pence is in, Mike Pence is doing and saying the right thing every time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=299.68s)]
*  He's saying and doing what he was elected to do, what his oath of office told him to do, which is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=306.56s)]
*  when Donald Trump says to him, you really should do this every single time, every time he says no, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=312.72s)]
*  every single time. Against interest and of course against the political pressure. Rachel? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=318.8s)]
*  I just wanted to jump in there and just follow sort of in the shadow of what Lawrence just said [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=325.04s)]
*  there. You noted, Chris, like it's kind of hard to keep track of what's in the public record. And [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=330.16s)]
*  Lawrence was saying this sort of feels like the screenplay version. This helps you connect [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=335.36s)]
*  different things. One of the things that I never connected before, it's something that's described [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  on page 63 of this document. We knew from Pence's memoir that when he was really making clear as of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=342.8s)]
*  New Year's Day, as of January 1st, that he was not going to go along with this, that all the lobby of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  him was not working. We know from his memoir that Trump threatened him and said, quote, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people are quote, gonna hate your guts. We knew that he had done that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=362.8s)]
*  What I did not know before reading this today is that he's threatening them that hundreds of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=369.2s)]
*  thousands of people are gonna effectively come after him for what he's doing here. And then [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=374.08s)]
*  immediately after he says that to Pence, immediately afterwards, he tweets a reminder to all of his [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=378.96s)]
*  supporters to make sure you're going to be in Washington, DC on January 6th. I mean, when he [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=386.0s)]
*  makes that threat to Pence, he's already announced, we'll be wild. Everybody come for January 6th. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=391.2s)]
*  He tells him hundreds of thousands of people are gonna come for you. And then he hits a reminder [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  in Twitter telling people that they need to show up so that he can make good on the threat. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=400.88s)]
*  It is just wielding the promise of an angry mob as a deliberate threat and as one that he is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=405.52s)]
*  planning to make good on. And I've never seen it laid out that way before, even though I knew [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=412.88s)]
*  the individual pieces of it. And it just sent a chill down my spine. Yeah. And Rachel, that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  dialogue that you pointed out there, there's a key line at the end, which would play to a jury [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=421.92s)]
*  so perfectly. When Donald Trump is saying to Mike Pence, you know, you really got to do this, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Pence saying he's not gonna do it. And then he's, Pence's, he's telling Pence, people are gonna be [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=432.16s)]
*  very disappointed in you. His last line to Mike Pence is, you're too honest. That tells you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  what Donald Trump thinks the truth is that Mike Pence is actually telling the truth. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=445.04s)]
*  You're too honest, Mike Pence. Yes. You're too honest being an admission of guilt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=452.24s)]
*  So state of mind for Donald Trump exists throughout the document, including in the present, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=457.44s)]
*  in those moments, you're too honest, but they carry the state of mind proof years after the fact, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  right up to 2023, right up to last year, where they're quoting Donald Trump, praising the people [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=468.0s)]
*  who attacked the Capitol, calling the martyrs, calling them heroes, calling them patriots, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=474.16s)]
*  raising money for specifies that he raises money for them, that he praises them at his campaign [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  events, that he plays their song at the campaign events. That's all goes into Donald Trump's mind [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  about what he was actually doing and how willful it was. That that what one of the things that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=491.04s)]
*  shows up here, Rachel, to what you just said, Lawrence, about all the stuff he's done [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=495.36s)]
*  subsequently about these folks who are his people. I mean, from signing the backpack of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=499.84s)]
*  the woman who came to the event to the J six choir creepy song being played at the rally to the promises [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=505.67999999999995s)]
*  of pardons, which essentially none of that is explicitly that stuff, criminal activity, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  and Smith isn't alleging it is. But to to show it's essentially a continuation of the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=517.92s)]
*  of what was happening in the run up in the aftermath. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=524.08s)]
*  Yeah. And page 100. You've heard today it's 165 page document. There's a whole lot of stuff that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=528.0s)]
*  is still redacted that we haven't seen at all appendices to this document, which may yet be [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=534.24s)]
*  released. And who knows when that will be. But towards the very end of this 165 page document, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=538.88s)]
*  page 162 and 163, they explicitly say that his post presidential statements go to explain his [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=543.68s)]
*  intent, his endorsements of the violent actions of his supporters in an ongoing way and the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=552.4s)]
*  promises of pardons and lionizing them and celebrating them and justifying it. Those things [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  may be distasteful, but not criminal unless it is being used as part of the criminal case against [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=564.24s)]
*  you because it shows that you were encouraging their actions, believed in their actions and were [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=569.04s)]
*  on their side and trying to use them as a lever in your personal crimes. It's not, I think, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  particularly useful or edifying for me to say this, but I'll say it, which is that it did make [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=580.4s)]
*  me enraged at the Supreme Court all over again. I mean, the degree to which the degree to which [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  again, the plain facts of this, everything that's been established, all of the due diligence that's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0f1aiPDBDQ&t=591.76s)]
