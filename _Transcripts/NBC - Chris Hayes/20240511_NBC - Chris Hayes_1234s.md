# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights May 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and today marks day 15 of Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan. It was obvious to everyone involved the ex- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=4.44s)]
*  president, who is not known for what you might call a strong attention span, is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=8.28s)]
*  losing his patience. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=12.44s)]
*  They don't like it when I talk to them during the day because they'd rather not have me talk at all. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=15.44s)]
*  So I'll now go and sit in that freezing cold courtroom for eight or nine hours and think about being on the campaign. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=19.44s)]
*  After complaining about the temperature, the 77-year-old ex-president sat down at the defense table and began shuffling through a large stack of papers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=27.880000000000003s)]
*  You might think he was poring over evidence or notes or arguments related to his legal defense, but no. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=35.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is leafing through positive press clippings about himself, much like a child with an iPad at a restaurant. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=40.88s)]
*  The ex-president needs to be entertained during the less salacious portions of his trial. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=47.88s)]
*  As Maggie Heberman in the New York Times puts it, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=53.32s)]
*  That guy was president. The whole country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, as we've covered on this show before, those articles come courtesy of one of Trump's aides, who his staff have nicknamed the human printer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm not making any of this up, okay? Quote. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  She has also been spotted running after Trump's golf cart on the golf course so that he can read things, presumably positive press, between holes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=83.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's need to be mollified, validated, apparently even extends to his actual legal defense. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=94.32s)]
*  So today, the ex-president's attorneys displayed this January 2017 New York Times front page as evidence with its rather critical headline, quote, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=101.32s)]
*  Strange thing to introduce in evidence. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=113.32s)]
*  According to reports, Trump is enamored with how he looks in the attached picture, which I find sort of adorable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=116.32s)]
*  And his former aide testified today that he sent a copy of the photo to multiple people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=124.32s)]
*  Like, don't I look good? Is that a good picture of me? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=128.32s)]
*  Now, Trump's need for additional distractions may have stemmed from the somewhat more technical nature of today's testimony. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=131.32s)]
*  Compared to the past two sessions with bombshell testimony from Stormy Daniels, today was a little on the drier side. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=138.76s)]
*  NBC News referring to it as, quote, the metaphorical eye of the storm, caught between yesterday's testimony from Daniels and Monday's expected testimony from former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=144.76s)]
*  We're going to have much more on him a bit later in the show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=156.76s)]
*  Much of today's proceedings was so run of the mill that many reporters spent part of the day on a rather particular fixation, with something stuck in Donald Trump's hair. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=158.76s)]
*  And as we heard from eyewitnesses in the courtroom, notice what looked like a piece of ribbon affixed to the back of his head. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=168.2s)]
*  For what it's worth, Maggie Haberman reported it was a particularly dark spindle of hairspray. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=173.2s)]
*  As for today's substance, we heard from a number of prosecution witnesses about the relevance of potential evidence, including representatives from AT&T and Verizon about phone records, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=179.2s)]
*  multiple paralegals from Manhattan District Attorney's Office about social media posts and phone data. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=187.2s)]
*  Because for as much as Donald Trump whines about this process and how long it's taking and how unfair the gag order is and how he should be on the campaign trail, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=191.64s)]
*  he is part of the reason why the trial is taking as long as it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=200.64s)]
*  Because his lawyers have taken this strange and rare step of refusing to stipulate, as it's called, the evidence being presented by the prosecution. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=203.64s)]
*  As the Washington Post explained last month, quote, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  But because, of course, Trump's tactic of choice has always been to delay things as much as possible so he can return to the White House and immediately make his legal woes disappear. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Joining me now are two people who watched this unfold at the courthouse today. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=238.52s)]
*  Suzanne Craig, an investigative reporter at New York Times who's been covering the trial, as well as Robert F. Kennedy's brain worms. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=241.52s)]
*  And Kristi Greenberg served as a federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=247.52s)]
*  I had to get a picture of that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=252.52s)]
*  It's one of the best scoops I've read recently. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=254.52s)]
*  Okay, so can we start on this? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  You're a lawyer and I want to start on this weird process thing because that dominated much of today. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  You've got this sort of, we've seen this before, essentially custodial testimony, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=263.96s)]
*  This record is what it purports to be and I can tell you that because I'm the paralegal who did it or I'm the person who transcribed it, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=268.96s)]
*  Why is this necessary again? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=275.96s)]
*  Okay, so you have to be able to show kind of that there is a basis to have this evidence be admitted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=277.96s)]
*  And usually that's a thing where again, if it's something like phone records, there's usually not really a dispute that this phone called this number at this time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=286.4s)]
*  And this is how long the call lasted for. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=295.4s)]
*  These are usually like pretty basic facts that everybody can agree to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=297.4s)]
*  But they are not stipulating to those, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=300.4s)]
*  The parties can't agree, so they have to bring in an evidence, a witness, somebody from Verizon, somebody from AT&T to just walk through what those mean. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=304.4s)]
*  So there are probably two reasons why the defense is doing this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=313.84s)]
*  I want to hear them because I'm confused as to why. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=316.84s)]
*  No, honestly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=318.84s)]
*  So one reason is, yeah, the jury is bored, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=320.84s)]
*  They're bored with this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=325.84s)]
*  This is not the most scintillated. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=327.84s)]
*  This is a let down from Stormy Daniels fireworks from yesterday. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=329.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=332.84s)]
*  They're bored and so they're sitting there and they're listening to all of this and who do they blame for it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=334.84s)]
*  Who's the one putting on these witnesses? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=337.84s)]
*  The prosecutors. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=339.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=342.28s)]
*  These are the prosecution's witnesses. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=343.28s)]
*  Because they have to because the defense is making them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=344.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=346.28s)]
*  But the jury doesn't know what the defense is. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=347.28s)]
*  The jury doesn't know what a stipulation is. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=349.28s)]
*  The jury doesn't know that in usual cases these kinds of things aren't put on as evidence. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=351.28s)]
*  So they're like, ugh, the prosecution, they're kind of lumbering in their case. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=355.28s)]
*  That's one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=358.28s)]
*  Two, it actually seems like the defense attorneys were really questioning the witnesses. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=359.28s)]
*  They weren't necessarily agreeing everything was what it said. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=364.28s)]
*  Like, well, couldn't this call, couldn't it just be a pocket dial? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=367.28s)]
*  So they're trying to raise actual doubts about it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  Like, oh, this says a minute, but really that could be 15 seconds and it rounds it up to a minute. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  They're trying to like, oh, and you have this call number calling this call number, but you don't know who's behind each of these calls. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  So there's actual substantive doubt sowing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  So they were doing two things, I think, at the same time. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Last month, Donald Trump summoned a who's who of top lobbyists and executives from the oil and gas industry to the upscale La Quinta slash bribery palace, he calls Mar-a-Lago, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=396.16s)]
*  and proceeded to solicit a billion dollars from the fossil fuel companies to get them elected as multiple outlets have now reported. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=405.16s)]
*  In exchange, the Washington Post reports, quote, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens of President Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=413.16s)]
*  The New York Times says, quote, Trump told the group that they should donate a billion dollars to his presidential campaign because if elected, he would roll back environmental rules that he said hamper their industry. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=422.6s)]
*  He told executives the amount of money they would save in taxes and legal expenses after repeal regulations would more than cover a billion dollar contribution. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=433.6s)]
*  And to be clear, this is not prosecutable under current law, particularly in the way that the Supreme Court has come to define bribery as a crime, which is extremely attenuated these days. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=442.04s)]
*  But in common parlance, it is a political quid pro quo, one that is so shocking that while we don't know the sources of these articles, it sure looks like Trump's offer managed to stun even a bunch of oil executives who are used to the most craven parts of big money in politics as anyone in the entire country. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=451.04s)]
*  Lisa Friedman is an author of that article for the New York Times, where she covers climate policy and politics, and she joins me now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=469.48s)]
*  Lisa, great to have you. We just described to me the setting, the conditions under which this event happened, what the folks who were invited were told. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=476.48s)]
*  Sure. Thanks so much for having me. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=484.48s)]
*  So last month, around April 11th, a number of executives and lobbyists for oil and gas companies arrived at Mar-a-Lago for what was described as an energy roundtable. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=486.92s)]
*  They dined on chopped steak, we were told, by people in the room. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=501.92s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump promised to unravel President Biden's climate change agenda. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=506.92s)]
*  Top on the list, we were told, were regulations that were put in place recently encouraging electric vehicle deployment. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=515.36s)]
*  Wind energy was a target, and of course, a temporary ban that the Biden administration imposed on permitting new liquefied natural gas terminals. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=526.36s)]
*  The former president then told the crowd that they should want to raise a billion dollars for him because this was going to help their industries, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  and the money that they would save in taxes and legal fees, fighting regulations, would be dwarfed. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  So there's sort of two pieces of context here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=558.24s)]
*  One is that before Citizens United, this wouldn't even really be a plausible ask, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=560.24s)]
*  I mean, if you're trying to raise a billion dollars in hard money, you know, campaign-limited $2,600 bytes, it's not going to happen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=566.24s)]
*  It is in the environment we live in now where the ask if audacious is plausible in the sense that, you know, the American Petroleum Institute could get a billion dollars channeled into something that some super PAC, right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=573.24s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I would note that the way it was relayed to us was less of a, you do this for me, I'll do this for you, and more of a, you in the room should want to raise a billion dollars for this campaign [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  because Trump too will be ready on day one to unravel the regulations and policies that are hurting your businesses. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, one of the other interesting bits of context here is that obviously the people in that room, I think, are opposed to the Biden climate agenda on green energy [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=612.12s)]
*  and also opposed to those regulatory stances you took, no new permitting on exporting liquid, nitfied natural gas, a pause on permits to Gulf and Mexico, taking Alaska offline, et cetera, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=622.12s)]
*  But if I'm not mistaken, we're pumping more oil and gas than any country in history ever, and they're making record profits, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  It's incongruous, isn't it? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, you're absolutely right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration is overseeing record oil and gas production. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  He is getting no credit for that from the oil and gas industry. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  And he also, and you know, the administration also has been pretty quiet about that fact, you have to mention also. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=660.0s)]
*  They're not eager to tout that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=669.0s)]
*  They, you know, they're very worried that environmental groups, especially young people, remain concerned about a number of green lights that the administration offered, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=672.0s)]
*  you know, last year, particularly on Willow, a major oil development in Alaska. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=687.44s)]
*  There's a lot of lingering anger over that, especially with young people. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=692.44s)]
*  And so we're finding the administration is not, you know, isn't out there telling people that they're doing a lot of development. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=695.44s)]
*  Totally. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=706.44s)]
*  But the people who do know it, I would suspect, are the people in that room. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=707.44s)]
*  And they give him no credit. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=710.44s)]
*  They probably know that they're pumping more oil and gas and doing pretty well, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=712.8800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think they know that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=717.8800000000001s)]
*  But they're still very angry at him, is my sense, from people I've talked to inside the energy world in the U.S. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=718.8800000000001s)]
*  You know, I've talked to executives with some major oil and gas companies who are very much in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=725.8800000000001s)]
*  the landmark climate law that has pumped $370-some-odd billion into renewable energy, also carbon capture and storage, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=735.32s)]
*  something the fossil fuel industry is eager for, also direct air capture, also hydrogen. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=745.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=752.32s)]
*  At the same time, when President Biden made the decision to pause LNG exports, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=753.32s)]
*  it really touched off a nerve within the oil and gas community that was already angry and frustrated over decisions [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=761.7600000000001s)]
*  like curtailing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and other places. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=770.7600000000001s)]
*  This has really struck a nerve, and there has been, you know, certainly no credit given to the administration for the record output of oil and gas [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=774.7600000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing right now. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=784.7600000000001s)]
*  The argument from the oil industry is that that is because of policies that preceded the Trump-Biden administration. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=785.7600000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=791.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=792.2s)]
*  Well, they're gentle souls, and they get very upset when things don't go their way. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=793.2s)]
*  And so maybe they'll come up with a billion dollars for the guy who's promising the agenda of their dreams. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=799.2s)]
*  Lisa Friedman, thank you very much. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=805.2s)]
*  You know the old saying, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=808.2s)]
*  Kristi Noem doesn't. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=811.2s)]
*  You may have heard that the Republican South Dakota governor's new book boasts about the time she shot and killed Cricket, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=813.6400000000001s)]
*  a 14-month-old wire-haired pointer that crossed her. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=819.6400000000001s)]
*  But have you heard the audiobook? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=823.6400000000001s)]
*  When I got back into my truck, Cricket was sitting in the passenger seat, looking like she had just won the lottery, the picture of pure joy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=827.6400000000001s)]
*  I hated that dog. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  As I drove home, I realized that I had no choice. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=837.6400000000001s)]
*  Cricket was untrainable, and after trying to bite me, dangerous to anybody that she came in contact with. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=842.08s)]
*  A dog who bites is dangerous and unpredictable. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=848.08s)]
*  Are you listening, Joe Biden? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=851.08s)]
*  I stopped the truck in the middle of the yard, I got out my gun, grabbed Cricket's leash, and I let her out into the pasture and down into the gravel pit. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=853.08s)]
*  It was not a pleasant job, but it had to be done. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=862.08s)]
*  Now you may already know that story, and also how moments later she came across a family goat and ended its life in that same gravel pit. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  But what you probably didn't know was that there were witnesses to the Kristi Noem spree killings. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=873.5200000000001s)]
*  And they were pretty creeped out. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=878.5200000000001s)]
*  My uncle, who was the general contractor building our house, called me and he said, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=880.5200000000001s)]
*  What got into you today? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  Nothing, I responded. Why? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=888.5200000000001s)]
*  He said, Well, the guy said you came barreling into the yard with your truck, you slammed the door, took a gun and a dog over the hill out of sight. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=891.96s)]
*  They heard one shot, you came back without the dog, then you grabbed the goat and headed back up over the hill, then they heard another shot. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=898.96s)]
*  You came back, slammed the pickup door again, went back, they heard another shot, and then you came back without the goat. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=904.96s)]
*  They said they hurried back to work before you decided they were next. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=910.96s)]
*  She put that in the book! [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=914.96s)]
*  That! [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=918.96s)]
*  Now, in the past week, Noem had been on a publicity tour for that book, which was obviously envisioned as part of a campaign to position herself as Donald Trump's possible vice presidential nominee. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=921.4000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately for Noem, it is not really playing out that way. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=932.4000000000001s)]
*  The book rollout has been an unmitigated disaster, the worst I've seen in a while. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=936.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I didn't even know it was possible anymore in American politics to have as bad of a week as Kristi Noem has had. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  We've all gotten used to so much insanity. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=947.84s)]
*  I mean, the guy at the top of the Republican ticket for whom she's auditioning is sitting in a New York courthouse, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=949.84s)]
*  while an adult film actress talks about him paying her off so she wouldn't talk about a trist between them that she said was the definition of bad sex. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=954.84s)]
*  And yet, even under our new political rules, Kristi Noem has managed to implode spectacularly. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=961.84s)]
*  Not simply because she killed an untrained puppy that did not hunt and a goat that smelled, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=967.84s)]
*  but because her response was to keep the story alive and even embellish it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  The truth of the story is that this was a working dog, and it was not a puppy. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=979.2800000000001s)]
*  It was a dog that was extremely dangerous. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, at one point, Greta Van Susteren tried to throw Noem a lifeline on Good Old Newsmax, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=989.2800000000001s)]
*  pivoting from the puppy she shot and killed and the goat she shot and killed to the not one, not two, but three horses Noem reluctantly had to put down in that same gravel pit. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=994.2800000000001s)]
*  These horses were old. They were in their late, late 20s. They were our rodeo horses, ranch horses, and they raised my girls. They took care of them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  Amazingly, showing the pictures of the horses in the gravel pit and adding to the number of animals that she's had to kill did not boost her chances. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  But then another problem was discovered. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1026.28s)]
*  Noem wrote in the book that she met North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and stared him down. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1029.72s)]
*  But it never happened, and it got pulled from the book. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1034.72s)]
*  The thing is, it wasn't just a lie. It was a lie so ludicrous it demonstrated just how little she understands world affairs. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1038.72s)]
*  In what universe is the leader of the so-called Hermit Kingdom meeting with the governor of South Dakota? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1045.72s)]
*  Did Noem go on a little junket to Pyongyang? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1051.72s)]
*  Did Noem do a state visit to Pierre that somehow flew under the radar? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1055.16s)]
*  It was a dumpster fire, and she kept throwing fuel on it, leading to some of the most genuinely heart-stopping interview moments on live TV I've ever seen. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1058.16s)]
*  So you did not meet with Kim Jong-un? That's what you're saying? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1071.16s)]
*  No, I've met with many, many world leaders. Many world leaders. I've traveled around the world. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1076.16s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1079.16s)]
*  That's a simple question. Did you or did you not meet with Kim Jong-un? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the answer that I have for you. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  Why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed? I've looked at your last several weeks. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm quoting you. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  If you were writing the book today, would you include the dog story? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1094.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, this is a wonderful book. Did you read the book? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1100.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, you should. Oh my goodness. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  We've been consumed with emails saying, I won't vote for this person. I won't vote for Trump if he puts her in the vice presidential spot. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, Stuart, I'm sorry you're not hearing from real Americans that live on farms and ranches. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1110.04s)]
*  If, Governor, if you asked me a month ago who's at the top of the list to run with Donald Trump, I would have said your name. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1114.04s)]
*  If you asked me that same question this morning, I don't even think you're on the list. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1119.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1123.04s)]
*  So my question for you... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1124.04s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1125.04s)]
*  Yes, really. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1126.04s)]
*  No one was getting beaten up so badly that she stopped doing interviews altogether. She even canceled on Fox News, which they did not take well. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1127.04s)]
*  Today she canceled on us. Yeah. The one time I actually read the book. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1134.04s)]
*  So moving forward with the interview, standing in for Kristi Noem is somebody she wished she had listened to before she ever wrote the stupid book, Dana Perino. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1139.48s)]
*  So Dana, AKA Governor Noem, did you write the book yourself? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1152.48s)]
*  You know, that's a great question for someone who wrote the book. And I don't think I will dignify your question with a response. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1157.48s)]
*  There are so many other important issues in the world like animal cruelty. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1164.92s)]
*  OK, you got to get on a curb. It's not a comedy show. But if you think that's vicious, you should read the Amazon reviews of Noem's book, which the retail giant locked down after a flood of what they called unusual reviewing activity, including one reader who said, my cat loved this book. He says cricket was asking for it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1170.92s)]
*  So where does Governor Kristi Noem go from here? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1189.92s)]
*  Apparently back home. A spokesman for Kristi Noem now says she has left her book tour, is going back to South Dakota to be prepared for some potential emerging bad weather systems. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  The title of Noem's book, by the way, is wait for it. No going back. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  That is perfect. I have no notes. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  You [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLGSAzUUYM&t=1222.92s)]
