# Elon Musk says he ‘can’t wait’ to work in the Trump White House
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U)
*  Foreign interference in American elections, something we've all been on the lookout for since 2016. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=0.0s)]
*  But there's also like a really disturbing information environment in America right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=5.0s)]
*  Domestically in this campaign year, there's nothing to do with illegal foreign interference. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=11.0s)]
*  In fact, it's an American is apple pie, a long tradition of extremely rich, real right-wing cranks from Henry Ford to H.L. Hunt. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=15.0s)]
*  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, is trying to control American politics. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=24.0s)]
*  He talks to Donald Trump several times a month, according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=29.0s)]
*  Trump has expressed interest in offering Musk a role auditing government agencies in his second administration, according to the Washington Post. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=33.0s)]
*  An idea Musk enthusiastically embraced just yesterday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=39.0s)]
*  Because Elon Musk runs one of the most influential Internet platforms, or at least it used to be, formerly known as Twitter, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=43.0s)]
*  and he has essentially turned that platform into a pro-Trump, pro-authoritarian disinformation machine [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=48.0s)]
*  where he just posts vile bigotry and disinformation that millions of people see and share. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=55.0s)]
*  Despite his site's own policy that you may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=60.0s)]
*  Musk does that basically all day long. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=68.0s)]
*  On Monday, he posted this like weird and pretty schlocky AI-generated image of what is supposed to be Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=70.0s)]
*  but doesn't really look like her in a Soviet-looking uniform commenting, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=78.0s)]
*  Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=81.0s)]
*  Can you believe she wears that outfit? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=84.0s)]
*  In point of fact, I can't because she doesn't and it's AI. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=86.0s)]
*  That post alone was viewed more than 81 million times, at least according to Twitter's metrics, which, you know, who knows if you can trust them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=89.0s)]
*  Then there's this from just yesterday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=97.0s)]
*  Musk boosted an hours-long interview between Tucker Cross, remember that guy, and a Nazi apologist, writing, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=99.0s)]
*  Very interesting. Worth watching. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=106.0s)]
*  In that interview, the Nazi apologist says how the Nazis weren't prepared for all the detainees they had and people just died in the camps. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=115.0s)]
*  Later, Musk deleted the post, but not before at least 8 million people saw it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=117.0s)]
*  So if you go onto Twitter, you likely saw it yourself because since he took over, the algorithm has been tweaked to make sure every post by Elon Musk is seen by everyone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=121.0s)]
*  Tech newsletter platformer received documents last year showing that Musk ordered his engineers to build a system promoting his posts to everyone on the platform, regardless of whether or not they follow him, which is, let's be honest, probably the real reason he bought the thing in the first place. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=131.0s)]
*  Brian Mack is technology reporter for The New York Times who covered the right-wing pairing in an article on how Elon Musk chose Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=148.0s)]
*  He's co-author of the forthcoming book, Character Limit, How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter, out September 17th, a book I'm very excited to see, and he joins me now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=156.0s)]
*  Ryan, I think that Musk's presence on the platform is one of those things where it's a little like Donald Trump's social media presence where if you're not exposed to it all the time, you can't really appreciate how extreme it is, how constant it is, how many blatantly untrue things that are happening. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=164.0s)]
*  And then there's a tweet over this weekend saying, you know, he thinks that women shouldn't vote, essentially, yesterday's tweet endorsing the Nazi apologists. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=216.0s)]
*  These are, you know, kind of out of bounds kind of things that he's kind of mainstreaming now with his 170 million followers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=227.0s)]
*  It also seems like in two ways the entire platform seems more and more engineered towards that kind of sort of like trollish right-wing politics, both as embodied by him who gets promoted to everyone and also other people on the platform and the people he interacts with. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=236.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like someone posting something like clearly untrue or some like gross conspiracy theory or innuendo that, you know, Nancy Pelosi's husband was not actually attacked by someone randomly but was engaged in some extramarital affair that went bad. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=250.0s)]
*  And then interacting with that such that it boosts the signal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=265.0s)]
*  And this is also something happening just all the time, it seems. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it feels like people who have engaged with that kind of content and are now emboldened to do so. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=272.0s)]
*  You know, they have also bought blue check marks through the verification program that he's now selling for, I think, eight dollars a month. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=277.0s)]
*  But, you know, this is this is what Elon Musk is now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=284.0s)]
*  I mean, when he took over the platform again, he tweeted that conspiracy theory about Paul Pelosi, you know, being attacked by a supposed lover, which of course wasn't true at the time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=288.0s)]
*  And, you know, kind of formed or, you know, kind of showed the path that he was on in terms of his radicalization. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=300.0s)]
*  What what is I mean, I don't think his interior states matter that much to me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=308.0s)]
*  But what what's the deal here? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=313.0s)]
*  Like, he's now giving he pledged tens of millions of dollars to Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=314.0s)]
*  He clearly interviewed Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=317.0s)]
*  He clearly is close to him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=319.0s)]
*  They talk a lot. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=320.0s)]
*  He clearly wants him to win. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=321.0s)]
*  He's using the platform like how symbiotic is this relationship? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=322.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's unclear what he wants out of this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=327.0s)]
*  I mean, I think he has a lot of, you know, things he he values. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=330.0s)]
*  You know, he's worried about immigration, for example. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=334.0s)]
*  He's worried about voter security, for example. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=337.0s)]
*  But, you know, there is, you know, it's it's unclear what he's going to get out of this, especially with Trump being wishy washy on electric vehicles, for example. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=341.0s)]
*  But, you know, they've talked about creating a position for him in the government and the Trump administration if that happens. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=352.0s)]
*  So, you know, and he's talked about a willingness to do that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=357.0s)]
*  So that's probably a start. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should know that one of the one of his obsessions in my lifetime, the sort of two most significant. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=363.0s)]
*  Lies that have sort of pinged around social media are about vaccine efficacy and their dangers and about the election being stolen 2020. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=369.0s)]
*  These are these are sort of the two most consequential, at least since the time I've been covering it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=378.0s)]
*  And on the election stuff, he's just like, this is maybe the central thing he posts about Arizona's refusing to remove illegal from voter rolls. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=382.0s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to cheat in the swing states. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=389.0s)]
*  He says, absolutely. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=392.0s)]
*  Researchers from a center that studies this 50 instances this year when he posted election claims that have been debunked by independent fact checkers are spread widely on the app anyway. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=394.0s)]
*  None of the 50 posts by Misk displayed a community note to correct his claims or add context calling into question the effectiveness of X's user driven fact checking system. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=404.0s)]
*  The center said this is something to keep your eyes on. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=412.0s)]
*  Obviously, as we get towards an even more heated period as we head into the election, I'm going to be checking out Ryan Max new book, which is out September 17th. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=415.0s)]
*  You see it over his shoulder there character limit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=422.0s)]
*  Ryan, thanks a lot. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=424.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTvTIiX6_6U&t=426.0s)]
