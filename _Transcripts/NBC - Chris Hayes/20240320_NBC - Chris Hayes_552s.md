# ‘Never seen this before’ Trump money expert on his scramble to make $464M bond
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM)
*  Joining me now, someone who has been covering Trump's financial peril very closely, Suzanne [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=0.0s)]
*  Craig. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=4.58s)]
*  She's investigative reporter at The New York Times. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=5.58s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=6.98s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=7.98s)]
*  I want to start by setting the table of how this would normally work, just because I'm [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=8.98s)]
*  not sure how this does normally work. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=13.26s)]
*  We've never seen this before, so let's just go forward knowing that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=16.0s)]
*  I've never seen something this large involving somebody like Donald Trump, but this is a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=20.66s)]
*  huge bond he's got to come up with. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=25.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  The answer to my first question, there is no how this would normally work, because you're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=28.9s)]
*  not normally in a situation where you've just got to come up with $500 million. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=32.56s)]
*  No, and that's why I've been carefully working through some of the various avenues in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=35.64s)]
*  last few days, because this is just so unusual. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=39.96s)]
*  He also has still some legal avenues left. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=43.44s)]
*  There's one thing I've learned about Donald Trump in my years of covering him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=46.36s)]
*  It's what you said, and it's don't count him out yet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  He's facing a very, very harsh deadline on Monday, but he still has some avenues. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  One of them is an appeals court has to rule on this, and they're going to do so by Monday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=58.14s)]
*  I would expect it would come Thursday, probably Friday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=63.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=66.74s)]
*  They could do a few things. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=67.74s)]
*  They have some options. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=69.14s)]
*  One is they could just say, let's stay this and put it off until the appeal has been seen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  through. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=75.58s)]
*  I don't think that that is going to happen, but it's one option. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=76.58s)]
*  The other option they have is he came to them and he said, I'd like the bond, the appeal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=79.5s)]
*  bond that I have to put up to be at $100 million. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=84.14s)]
*  They rejected that, but they could come up with a compromise that isn't this $500 million [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=87.36s)]
*  that he has said he cannot meet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=93.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=96.08s)]
*  The $500 million question, there's some liquid market for these kinds of bonds at smaller [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=97.08s)]
*  amounts, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=103.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=104.64s)]
*  If you had a civil judgment against you for $5 million, I don't have $5 million cash, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=105.64s)]
*  there's some posting of collateral where the bondsmen post it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=108.84s)]
*  Collateral is really tough for these companies that take the appeals bond. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=113.16s)]
*  They want cash. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=116.96s)]
*  They're not in the real estate business. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=117.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=119.46s)]
*  They don't want to own Trump power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=120.46s)]
*  What does that do to them? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=121.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=122.46s)]
*  Who knows what that's going to be worth in three years or two years when this is seen [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=123.46s)]
*  through? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=125.74s)]
*  They want something they can liquidate in the markets that night. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=126.74s)]
*  And clearly, he doesn't have the cash. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=130.38s)]
*  He does not have the cash. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=132.82s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=134.06s)]
*  He's represented that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=135.06s)]
*  He may have some of it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=136.06s)]
*  I'm going to get to that in a minute because I think everybody imagines come Monday, if [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=137.06s)]
*  this doesn't go his way, Letitia James is going to be there with the New York State [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=140.5s)]
*  Troopers with a padlock. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=144.06s)]
*  They may put liens on properties, but they may also come and seize what cash he has, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  which could throw the Trump organization. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Can they even meet their payroll come Tuesday if this goes forward? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  There are so many unknowns that are going to happen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=158.24s)]
*  But the other thing is that he just backing up to the appeals court that's going to rule, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=161.28s)]
*  they could just reject him and then he can appeal that and go to a higher court. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=167.24s)]
*  But Monday is still a deadline that he is facing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=174.52s)]
*  So let's say there's some off road for an appeals court possible. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=175.58s)]
*  Let's say that off road doesn't happen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=179.5s)]
*  So before we get to the showing of the padlock, could you, again, this is all it's fairly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=181.74s)]
*  uncharted, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=188.46s)]
*  Could you just do like a friendly look? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Like, could Elon Musk say, it would be very useful for me as Elon Musk to have the nominee [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=192.62s)]
*  of one of the two major parties and the possible future president owe me an enormous amount [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  of favor. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=202.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=203.58s)]
*  So you're going to post $500 million for him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=204.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=206.96s)]
*  That's one, I would imagine that one option is somebody could come forward and they could [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=207.96s)]
*  say we're going to give this to you as a gift or a loan. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  Those are both taxable events and would cost the person doing it and there would be paperwork [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=217.08s)]
*  involved. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=221.8s)]
*  That is one option. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=222.8s)]
*  The other option is that he could find somebody who he has a friendly transaction with to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=224.08s)]
*  sell some properties. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=229.36s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=231.08s)]
*  So like a quick sale. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=232.88s)]
*  One that I'm thinking of and I don't have any reporting on this to say that it's happening. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=235.26s)]
*  He owns a hotel in Las Vegas with a fellow by the name of Phil Ruffin. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=239.54s)]
*  They are on very good terms. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=244.94s)]
*  Phil Ruffin is a supporter of his politically. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  Phil Ruffin could say, I'm going to buy you out of your half of the hotel and they could [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=249.3s)]
*  do a friendly transaction that would not take a long time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  And let's say that that transaction, any transaction that he comes up with takes 60 days. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=256.06s)]
*  Donald Trump may come to the courts and say, I'd like a little bit of extra time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=261.18s)]
*  I would imagine just let's just say James. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=265.46s)]
*  She might give him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=268.94s)]
*  She might say, OK, she might not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=269.94s)]
*  But that's another thing that could happen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=271.38s)]
*  OK, so some kind of someone loans him or gives him money. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=273.64s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=276.6s)]
*  But someone loves the money. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=277.6s)]
*  Some kind of friendly, relatively fast and streamlined financial transaction like or [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=278.6s)]
*  one or two because he needs a lot of money. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=283.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=285.64s)]
*  So a partner buys him out of his half of the Vegas casino being an example. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=286.64s)]
*  And there's there's one other one just really quickly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=289.32s)]
*  The appeals bonds that he's trying to arrange, there still could happen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=292.06s)]
*  There's been a lot of negotiation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=296.48s)]
*  And when I read that in a paper, you know, in the court papers, I think, well, there [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=297.48s)]
*  was a lot of discussion potentially about taking real estate as collateral. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=301.5s)]
*  I still don't rule that out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=305.58s)]
*  I think it's unlikely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=306.94s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  There's another option. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  It just seems like if you take real estate collateral, you just have enormous downside [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  risk. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=314.82s)]
*  Huge. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=315.82s)]
*  And some of them have loans on them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=316.82s)]
*  So they already have obligations against them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=318.5s)]
*  If anyone's watching this and wants my financial advice, I'm just letting you know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=321.72s)]
*  I see some downside risk. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=325.64s)]
*  I don't want an office tower in New York either. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=326.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=328.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=329.96s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=330.96s)]
*  Another great point. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=331.96s)]
*  So, OK, now we get to the appeals court doesn't no offer on the appeals court. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=332.96s)]
*  He can't find someone to lend him the money or to raise the cash through sale. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=338.04s)]
*  What happens? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=342.96s)]
*  When Letitia James comes to the court and she will start putting liens on the properties, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=344.96s)]
*  I don't think we're going to see a situation where they're padlocked and she's going to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  take them and sell them because she may have to give those back at the end if he is successful [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=354.5s)]
*  on appeal. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  So that's a whole other issue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  But she will start to take possession potentially of properties or of if he has cash sitting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  there in accounts, that's also fair game or also obligations that he has coming in. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  She could seize a rent roll. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=373.56s)]
*  There's just so many options. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  She could do that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  My understanding is yes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=377.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=378.56s)]
*  Or the cash that he had. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=379.56s)]
*  Like let's say there's $40 million sitting in an account that they make payroll or whatever [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=380.56s)]
*  it is. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=384.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=385.56s)]
*  And that's pretty, when you think about it from the Trump organization's point of view, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=386.56s)]
*  they need cash to run the business. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=389.72s)]
*  Works. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=391.12s)]
*  So these are all really scary things they are facing coming out of that massive court [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=392.12s)]
*  case that we had where they were found to have committed widespread fraud. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=396.48s)]
*  But these are all the things. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=400.56s)]
*  We just don't know what's going to happen. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  But these are just some of the options that people are talking about that when they're [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=403.7s)]
*  looking at what are the potential things that could happen come Monday if it gets to Monday [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=407.14s)]
*  and we have a seizure. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=411.78s)]
*  Can I just circle around? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=412.78s)]
*  This may be outside of your portfolio, so tell me if it is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=414.34s)]
*  But I'm just trying to put this in context. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=417.26s)]
*  You said this sort of thing doesn't, we're sort of out past the frontier. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=418.73999999999995s)]
*  When the tobacco settlement happens, there's enormous civil settlements or civil judgments [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=423.26s)]
*  sometimes that happen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  Now usually when there are settlements, you're structuring them over time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=429.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=432.8s)]
*  But even if there's an enormous judgment, are those just normally structured in different [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=433.8s)]
*  ways or do they tend to be against better capitalized firms? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  Usually, that or the other thing that's really significant about this is Donald Trump let [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=444.16s)]
*  it get to this point. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  He should have settled this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=452.18s)]
*  And I don't know, at some point that might have been on the table. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  I think Logistia James at a certain point was pretty hell bent on bringing this to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=456.62s)]
*  trial but because it got to this point, it is so severe now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=460.38s)]
*  And the options are just every day are getting fewer and fewer for him. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=466.14000000000004s)]
*  And presumably, I mean I hadn't thought of this before, but presumably one of the reasons [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=469.98s)]
*  that settlement is attractive is aside from taking some discount on the total dollar amount [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=474.82000000000005s)]
*  where you're rolling the dice with a judge or jury, you're also going to as part of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=478.94s)]
*  settlement figure out the structure of those payments precisely so that you do not end [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=483.0s)]
*  up in the situation where you're maybe selling your office tower on a Sunday. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=488.2s)]
*  And another part of it is that you can't do business with any banks in New York. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=493.24s)]
*  There's other pieces to this too that are just quite frightening for the Trump organization. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=497.8s)]
*  I mean they box themselves in and now they have until Monday and there could be some [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=502.96s)]
*  sort of relief coming from the appeals court. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=507.88s)]
*  But so far the appeals court has said they offered the $100 million as a sort of can [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=510.2s)]
*  you meet us there while we go up on appeal and that was rejected. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=515.3s)]
*  And they may now say two or three hundred is enough with some other condition that I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=519.7s)]
*  haven't thought of. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=523.66s)]
*  And so that's sort of what we're waiting for immediately. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=524.66s)]
*  I think we're going to see that before Monday. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=527.02s)]
*  Alright, look for that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=528.86s)]
*  That was so illuminating. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=529.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=530.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=531.86s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=532.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxx0aVmlWJM&t=540.2s)]
