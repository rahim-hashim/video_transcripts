# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Dec. 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM)
*  We want to go back to the big news that we brought you at the top of this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has been kicked off another presidential ballot, this time in the state of Maine, a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=4.92s)]
*  decision that comes 10 days after the Supreme Court of Colorado ruled that Trump is disqualified [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=9.88s)]
*  from the ballot there due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that culminated [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=15.48s)]
*  in the insurrection of the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=20.84s)]
*  Though that Colorado decision is on pause, pending an appeal by the state Republican [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=23.44s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  There are 16 states that have been considering efforts to remove Trump from their ballots, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=28.4s)]
*  including Michigan, whose Supreme Court decided yesterday that Trump can stay on the ballot [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=32.36s)]
*  and Colorado and Maine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=37.6s)]
*  Most of those are lawsuits working their way through the courts, but Maine's process was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=40.44s)]
*  a little different. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  There, the arguments were made directly to the Democratic Secretary of State, Shenna [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  Bellows. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It was her decision to make. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We have her here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=52.08s)]
*  Shenna Bellows, the Maine Secretary of State who signed off on that decision joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=53.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on All In this evening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=59.24s)]
*  I'm just going to ask you up front, what went into making this decision? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=61.28s)]
*  Was it your own research? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=65.84s)]
*  Did you have a legal team together? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=67.52s)]
*  Did you look at the Colorado decision? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=69.84s)]
*  What was the process to come to the conclusion that Donald Trump should be disqualified from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=72.0s)]
*  being on the Maine ballot? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=76.16s)]
*  Well, first it's important, and thank you for having me, it's important to understand [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=78.36s)]
*  how Maine's process differs from other states. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=83.08s)]
*  Under the United States Constitution, time, place, and manner, every state's laws around [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=87.12s)]
*  elections and the conduct of elections are slightly different. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=91.64s)]
*  That's why, for example, in neighboring New Hampshire, you see more than a dozen candidates [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=95.12s)]
*  in both the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries, whereas in Maine we have a very [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=98.88s)]
*  different process. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=104.36s)]
*  We had two Democratic candidates qualify for the presidential primary and less than a dozen [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  candidates qualify for the Republican primary. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=111.56s)]
*  Now, under the law, I first make a determination about ballot qualification. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=114.52s)]
*  We accepted Trump's consent form and petitions to be placed on the primary ballot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  However, any registered Maine voter may challenge the qualifications of any candidate within [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  a five-day period. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=134.16s)]
*  And then I am required by law, it's an authority delegated to me explicitly by the Maine legislature, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=136.0s)]
*  to hold what's called a Section 336 challenge hearing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Both parties come, they present their evidence, they file briefs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  I review only that evidence in the context of the laws, the facts presented, and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Constitution, and then I must make a determination. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=158.36s)]
*  I'm duty-bound to both hold a hearing and make a ruling. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=161.52s)]
*  And under the law, there's a very compressed timeline. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=167.64s)]
*  In evaluating this, I came to the conclusion that I could not, unfortunately or fortunately, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=170.44s)]
*  wait for the United States Supreme Court to make a decision. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=178.4s)]
*  The Maine law required me to issue that decision, which I did today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=183.36s)]
*  Now, I have to say, not only is this an incredibly important decision, but it's a very brave [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  decision. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=196.08s)]
*  The Trump campaign has already come out attacking you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  They have said that you are a virulent leftist and a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=201.44s)]
*  It goes without saying that we all saw what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=208.8s)]
*  We've seen a tremendous amount of violence associated with any time someone tries to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=212.68s)]
*  hold Trump accountable. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=218.08s)]
*  We've seen death threats against the judges in Colorado. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=219.08s)]
*  Was that a concern of yours, and has the state provided you with additional protection and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=223.24s)]
*  support since you've come down with this decision? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  First and foremost, it's important to know my oath to the Constitution, my obligations [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=233.0s)]
*  to the Constitution and rule of law come before any other consideration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  No other factors could weigh on that decision and did not. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=242.4s)]
*  I'm very fortunate. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=247.4s)]
*  We are very fortunate here in Maine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=248.4s)]
*  We have terrific support from law enforcement, both within my department, the Maine Capitol [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=249.4s)]
*  Police, the Maine State Police. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=254.4s)]
*  I feel well protected, as I have been for my entire time as Secretary. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=256.04s)]
*  So I have to ask this because I think this also speaks to your credibility. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=263.0s)]
*  Maine has some of the highest turnout of any state in the union. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=266.24s)]
*  I mean, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, you have, you know, Maine, even though as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=270.28s)]
*  a state tends to vote for Democrats for president, you have one Independent Senator and one [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=275.12s)]
*  Republican. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=279.6s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=280.6s)]
*  How do you get such high turnout in the state amongst all sort of political partisans? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=281.6s)]
*  I smiled because we were number one in voter turnout per capita in 2022. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=287.0s)]
*  We are really proud of that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=291.92s)]
*  And we have a really strong framework of election laws that encourage citizen participation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=294.36s)]
*  We have same day voter registration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  We have no excuse absentee voting up to 30 days prior to election day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=304.2s)]
*  We make it really easy to register to vote, to cast your ballot and know your ballot will [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=308.96s)]
*  be counted. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  And we're really proud of our national leadership in voter participation and citizen engagement [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  in elections and in the democratic process. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=321.96s)]
*  And that's why we take so seriously our obligations to the Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Bellows, there are people all over the country, Independent groups, other Secretaries [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=332.4s)]
*  of State, you know, judges, legislators, lawyers who are watching you right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=337.44s)]
*  Are you expecting to or have you prior to this decision? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=344.12s)]
*  Has anyone reached out to you? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=348.38s)]
*  Have other Secretaries of State reached out to you and said, hey, how did you, you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm struggling with this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=352.96s)]
*  Could you help me as well? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  Or is this a decision that you're saying, hey, everything that I think is in this written [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=355.88s)]
*  decision and I'm not really open to providing, you know, counsel or assistance to any other [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=360.8s)]
*  states that may be struggling with this issue? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=369.08s)]
*  The latter is the case. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=370.08s)]
*  This decision is based on Maine law and the facts that were presented to me in the Section [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=372.0s)]
*  336 challenge. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=376.4s)]
*  It was really important to me to look at the evidence presented in the public hearing and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=378.28s)]
*  the law and the facts presented in the context of Maine law, Sections 336, 337 and 443. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=384.44s)]
*  It's a very detailed decision. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=392.12s)]
*  We lay out why under Maine law, the Secretary of State has the authority, indeed the obligation, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=393.96s)]
*  I'm duty bound to make this determination. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=399.96s)]
*  We also, I rather laid out that the record demonstrates that in fact the events of January [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=403.76s)]
*  which were unprecedented and tragic were an insurrection in the meaning of Section 3 of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=410.96s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  And finally, in reviewing the facts presented, the evidence, the law, the history, we determined [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=428.52s)]
*  was disqualified. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=434.64s)]
*  So one of the things that you mentioned is that since anyone within a certain period [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=437.12s)]
*  of time can challenge a candidate's eligibility, you have people present the case that Trump [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=441.0s)]
*  should be off the ballot and obviously you have people present the case that Trump should [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  remain on the ballot, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=448.92s)]
*  You had people from both sides making this argument. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=450.48s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=453.44s)]
*  And I wonder if this sort of came up because it's always something I've questioned about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=454.44s)]
*  sort of the Trump argument. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=459.32000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump claims that he was elected in 2020 and that the election was stolen from [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=461.2s)]
*  him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=468.24s)]
*  I mean, my understanding of the Constitution is if you've already been elected twice, you're [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=469.24s)]
*  not allowed to serve again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=472.52s)]
*  How did you deal with some of the arguments that you heard from the Trump side and do [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=474.48s)]
*  they have an opportunity to appeal if they're unhappy with your decision? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=480.32s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=484.36s)]
*  Mr. Trump was represented by counsel. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=486.36s)]
*  This was an administrative hearing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=488.56s)]
*  I was serving not as an advocate but an adjudicator as an administrative hearing officer in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=490.0s)]
*  hearing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  And Paul Gordon was one of the three challengers who brought a challenge and he brought it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  under the 22nd Amendment, alleging that because Mr. Trump has said publicly that he won in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=502.32s)]

*  My decision also found that the facts did not. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=513.8s)]
*  We're not in dispute. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=519.72s)]
*  No party suggested that Mr. Trump had in fact won in 2020 and the 22nd Amendment did not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=520.72s)]
*  apply in this case. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=526.88s)]
*  There were other challenges brought by Mary Ann Royal and by a group of former senators, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  Republican state senator, former Republican state senator Kimberly Rosen, former Republican [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=534.6800000000001s)]

*  were brought under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=544.36s)]
*  And that is where my ruling did in fact find that Mr. Trump was not qualified for ballot [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=548.4399999999999s)]

*  Remember these guys, the Republican young guns? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=568.84s)]
*  In 2010, they were the boy band generation of Republicans who were going to change the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=571.84s)]
*  world. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  Paul Ryan of the P90X flexing, he was the cute one, and Kevin McCarthy was the tax-loving [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=578.0400000000001s)]
*  sensitive one, and Eric Cantor was the bad boy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  They rounded out a group that would fuse Tea Party politics with wonky policies. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  And, well, you know how that worked out. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  Ryan and McCarthy ultimately lost their leadership roles. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  Cantor couldn't even win a reelection primary. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, instead of boy bands, House Republicans are a bunch of proud boys. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=600.0400000000001s)]
*  Gun-loving MAGA extremists like Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=605.24s)]
*  who post memes instead of actually passing laws. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=610.24s)]
*  Now heading into the 2024 election, it looks like nobody wants to hear their tired old [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=613.24s)]
*  songs anymore. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=617.24s)]
*  Yesterday, Boebert confirmed she is switching from her purple Colorado district to a deep [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=619.24s)]
*  red one in hopes of winning reelection. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=624.24s)]
*  That is after she was nearly knocked off by her Democratic challenger last year. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=627.24s)]
*  What would we say about the future of the Democratic Party if prominent members like [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=631.44s)]
*  Eric Swalwell or AOC had to go district shopping in order to stay in power? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=635.44s)]

*  Thank you so much, Congresswoman Waters. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=648.44s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=650.44s)]
*  You have served in office. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=652.44s)]
*  You have advised presidents. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=653.44s)]
*  You have seen ups and downs of the Democratic Party. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=655.44s)]
*  If Eric Swalwell, if AOC, if you had to go district shopping in order to get reelected, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=657.6400000000001s)]
*  what would that be saying about the state of the Democratic Party? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=665.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, it would be saying that we are not capable of representing the districts where we have [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=668.6400000000001s)]
*  started out and now we want to switch and we go look for something else. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=676.6400000000001s)]
*  Maybe we would get elected in a different district, but both parties are not going to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=681.6400000000001s)]
*  get elected in a different district. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=686.84s)]
*  She was caught publicly vaping and not only was she doing that, she was being groped, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=688.84s)]
*  she was being felt on by the boyfriend. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=696.84s)]
*  Now this is a representative of the United States of America who has the audacity to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=699.84s)]
*  talk about caring about children and education and families. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=705.84s)]
*  Even if she goes to a new district that is more conservative, I think those conservative [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=709.84s)]
*  people, those representatives of those districts will understand that this is not someone that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  they want to serve as a representative for them because of what she is transporting to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  their children. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  She's trying to go into Ken Buck's former district. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=728.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=731.0400000000001s)]
*  And Ken Buck was one of the Republicans saying, hey, we're not getting anything done. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  He was tired of people like Lauren Boebert. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  As someone who has worked with presidents and gotten things done, somebody who talked [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  about Donald Trump and worked with Barack Obama, worked with members, what is it like [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=742.24s)]
*  being in a Congress right now that can't seem to get anything done? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=746.24s)]
*  I mean, this is the least productive House of Representatives session since 1989. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=750.24s)]
*  Only 20 bills passed and signed into law. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=756.24s)]
*  What's that like for you who's so used to actually getting things done in Congress? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=758.24s)]
*  Well, actually, it's pathetic on the Republican side. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=762.24s)]
*  They can't govern. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=765.24s)]
*  They're in disarray. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=766.24s)]
*  It is chaotic. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=768.24s)]
*  It is pitiful. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=769.24s)]
*  You know, 700 votes or so, they got, what, 27 votes all year and only 26 of them were [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=770.44s)]
*  passed. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=778.44s)]
*  And so they're incapable of directing and running this government. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=779.44s)]
*  And so they're in deep trouble. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=783.44s)]
*  And if they think somehow that is not going to be understood by the American public and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=785.44s)]
*  they're going to win because they're all hiding behind Donald Trump, it's not going to happen. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=791.44s)]
*  We're going to take back the House for sure. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=795.44s)]
*  I have to ask you this because one of the things that you often hear political analysts, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=798.6400000000001s)]
*  pundits, journalists talk about is where is the enthusiasm going to be for the Democratic [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  Party? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=808.6400000000001s)]
*  You are probably one of the most well-known members of Congress on either side of the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=809.6400000000001s)]
*  party. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=813.6400000000001s)]
*  You are mean. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=814.6400000000001s)]
*  You are known by older voters and younger voters and everything else like that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=815.6400000000001s)]
*  What do you think your role will be in 2024 when it comes to speaking to those people [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=819.6400000000001s)]
*  who are disenchanted, speaking to those people who say it's a pox on both houses, the Democrats [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=824.84s)]
*  can't get anything in the public. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=828.84s)]
*  What are you going to say to those people next year to make sure that they turn out [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=829.84s)]
*  and vote so that the House can get back into the hands of Democrats? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=832.84s)]
*  One of the things I think we need to do is remind people of what we have done and what [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=834.84s)]
*  Democrats have accomplished and what Biden has done. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=839.84s)]
*  We did a remarkable job doing covert, making sure that people had food on the table. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=842.84s)]
*  Don't forget the PPP loan that we created in order for small businesses to have an opportunity [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=847.84s)]
*  to keep their personnel and to keep those doors open. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=854.84s)]
*  So Biden has done a great job. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=857.84s)]
*  And for the young people, what do you think has happened to the debt that they owe because [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=859.84s)]
*  of their student loans? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=864.84s)]
*  He's reduced that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=866.84s)]
*  He's working at it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=867.84s)]
*  And he's done a good job. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=868.84s)]
*  He really has been a strong Democrat who has delivered and he's promised a lot and he's [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=870.84s)]
*  delivered a lot. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=876.84s)]
*  And for black people, he has certainly delivered. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=877.84s)]
*  I tend to be skeptical when I see all these numbers that say, oh, black folks are voting [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=880.84s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=884.84s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=885.84s)]
*  I don't know a lot of African Americans. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=886.84s)]
*  I don't know a lot of black folk. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=888.84s)]
*  I don't know a lot of anybody who says that they're voting for Trump. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=889.84s)]
*  When you hear those kinds of things, when you hear it said by serious journalists and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=892.84s)]
*  everything else like that, that black people, in particular black men, are moving to the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=896.84s)]
*  Republican Party, is that what you're seeing on the ground? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=900.84s)]
*  Is that what you see in L.A.? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=902.84s)]
*  No, I hear a little bit of that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=903.84s)]
*  But sometimes I think that's done to create controversy. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=905.84s)]
*  And I think that people want to see if, you know, young people are going to, you know, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=909.84s)]
*  start to talk like they are talking about supporting Trump. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=914.84s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=918.84s)]
*  Black people understand who their friends are. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=920.84s)]
*  Black people understand what Trump has done in dividing and conquering and that he's aligned [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=922.84s)]
*  not only with the KKK but with the Proud Boys, with the Oath Keepers, with the QAnon. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=928.84s)]
*  These are domestic terrorists who are out not only to undermine our democracy and disregard [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=935.84s)]
*  the Constitution and they're going to be happy. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=942.84s)]
*  Young people are going to be happy to elect someone that they said wants to, he said he wants [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=946.84s)]
*  to be a dictator. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=951.84s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=952.84s)]
*  When it gets down to it, black people are going to turn out in large numbers. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=954.84s)]
*  Young people are going to turn out in large numbers. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=958.84s)]
*  And I want to tell you that independents are going to turn out because they know that this [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=960.84s)]
*  man who loves Russia, who loves dictators, who loves Putin and speaks up for him and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=966.84s)]
*  who's aligned with him is not good for this country or our democracy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=972.84s)]
*  Always love talking to the congressman. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=977.84s)]
*  Maxine Waters, thank you so much for joining us this evening on All In. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=979.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAxlou70cGM&t=990.84s)]
