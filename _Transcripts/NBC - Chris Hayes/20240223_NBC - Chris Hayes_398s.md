# Trump NATO threat likely part of 'calculus' of Nalvany death, says Vindman
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ)
*  The warning lights are blinking red on the fascist intent of a second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And it is not an abstract threat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=5.92s)]
*  There are people, Americans, who literally fear Trump's retribution, just as he loudly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=8.18s)]
*  promises at rallies if he's reelected. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=13.42s)]
*  One of those people is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a key witness in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=16.76s)]
*  the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=22.0s)]
*  He flagged Trump's 2019 perfect phone call, where Trump pressured the president of Ukraine [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=24.32s)]
*  to open an investigation into his chief political rival, Joe Biden. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=30.08s)]
*  But now, as NBC News reports, Colonel Vindman's wife is so worried about Trump's return to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=34.32s)]
*  the White House that she doesn't want to celebrate her 50th birthday next month because the family [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=39.96s)]
*  might need the money in case they have to flee the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=45.28s)]
*  A country, by the way, Colonel Vindman volunteered to defend and served very honorably. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=48.839999999999996s)]
*  Colonel Vindman is the former director for European Affairs for the National Security [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=55.08s)]
*  Council. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=59.4s)]
*  He is currently a senior advisor to vote vets, and he joins me now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=60.4s)]
*  Colonel, it's so good to see you, my friend. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=64.56s)]
*  I hope you're doing well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=66.16s)]
*  One of the things that we hear a lot is the hyperbolic, if so and so is elected, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=68.28s)]
*  If so and so is elected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=74.64s)]
*  I'm leaving the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=77.0s)]
*  You told NBC that you don't plan to leave, but regardless, this hyperbolic, excited state, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=78.36s)]
*  this isn't just hyperbole for you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=86.24s)]
*  This is a real concern. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=88.68s)]
*  Tell us about those family concerns that you and your wife have. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=90.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=93.84s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=94.84s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=95.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, my wife and I have a slight difference of opinion here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=96.84s)]
*  It's probably because my daughter classifies me as responsible for fun, my wife responsible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=101.84s)]
*  for safety. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  So she thinks about the what ifs, the worst case scenarios. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  I think about how to keep Trump out of office, how to avoid this worst case scenario, not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=112.44s)]
*  for me, not for the scores of other folks on Trump's enemies list, but the millions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  of Americans that would suffer through a second administration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=123.84s)]
*  For her, it does end up being a real concern. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=127.36s)]
*  She wants to understand what our situation would be if Donald Trump is the chief executive [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  responsible for the IRS and directs the IRS to conduct unlawful investigations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=139.0s)]
*  She wants to know if he uses federal law enforcement to pursue his enemies or if he just issues [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  instructions to his sycophantic followers to seek retribution against folks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=151.32s)]
*  For me, again, I'm laser focused on making sure that person never sees the Oval Office [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=157.44s)]
*  again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=164.52s)]
*  Again, more so for the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=165.52s)]
*  For me, I'm not intimidated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=168.96s)]
*  I'm out there prepared to fight him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  But that's a real threat, I guess, to scores of Americans that have made his list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=174.6s)]
*  You have been very, very strong in your view on this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=182.0s)]
*  And in fact, you've been more than sensitive to the threats and the difficulties presented [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=187.0s)]
*  by Trump and a lot of his minions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=192.88s)]
*  You had a message for your father, as I recall, during your impeachment testimony. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=195.52s)]
*  And I wanted to play just a little bit of that so folks can hear what you said to your dad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=205.84s)]
*  that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=211.32s)]
*  to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=215.52s)]
*  Do not worry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=220.52s)]
*  I'll be fine for telling the truth. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=221.52s)]
*  And that's always the bottom line, isn't it, Colonel? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=224.52s)]
*  Telling the truth. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=226.94s)]
*  And you wear that badge in particular very well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=227.94s)]
*  Does all of this that's going on now, the elevation of this, are those concerns still [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=232.56s)]
*  there for your dad and other family members? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=237.76s)]
*  And what do you say to them? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=240.32s)]
*  Not just the conversations you have with your wife and your immediate family, but your family [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=241.72s)]
*  and friends who are also concerned about you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  I think there are concerns. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=250.32s)]
*  My dad, of course, is still concerned. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  He's turning 92 this year. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=255.0s)]
*  He's very clear-eyed about what the kind of leadership that he experienced in the Soviet [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=257.68s)]
*  Union and how that could manifest here in the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  For me, what I try to do is I try to raise the alarm. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=267.96s)]
*  And this should sound alarming to the American public. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=271.76s)]
*  The threat of MAGA, the threat of Trump, is real. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=275.0s)]
*  It is not a threat in the distant future, November, or if he gets seated again in January. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump invited Vladimir Putin to attack NATO. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=285.2s)]
*  I would say that that probably was a contributing factor in the calculus around the assassination [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  of Navalny. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=295.4s)]
*  Stories now coming out of Moldova and the idea of a referendum in that country to join [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=297.52s)]
*  the Russian Federation, that is a testing of the waters. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=304.32s)]
*  That is a signal that Russia is ready to be more aggressive because it has a sense of impunity. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=308.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Because Trump is not just the likely Republican nominee. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  He's the head of the Republican Party. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=321.96s)]
*  He issues marching orders to Speaker Johnson. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=323.92s)]
*  He issues marching orders to this radical MAGA political establishment that is now the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=327.36s)]
*  Republican House. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=333.2s)]
*  And that signals that absolute paralysis, not passing Ukraine aid, not taking severe [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=335.24s)]
*  actions against Putin and his regime. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  That's a signal to either—it's an invitation, is the way Putin sees it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=347.04s)]
*  That's what I really contend with on a regular basis. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  That's what I want to make sure the American public is aware of. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  So like this, we don't have a second Trump administration. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=358.6s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, your words are a sharp reminder, particularly as [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=362.0s)]
*  we recognize we're going into the second year of this invasion by Russia and Ukraine, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=367.68s)]
*  and appreciate your service then and your service now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV8jEWNahQ&t=382.16s)]
