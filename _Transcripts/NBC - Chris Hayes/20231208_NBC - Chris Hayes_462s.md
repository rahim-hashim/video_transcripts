# 'Stunning': Texas threatens doctors, hospitals who provide court-allowed abortion
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk)
*  At the highest levels of the Republican Party, there's all this talk recently about how reasonable [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=0.0s)]
*  they're going to be about abortion. Nikki Haley talking about humanizing her position to Donald [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=4.32s)]
*  Trump portraying himself as a moderate, ludicrously and pointing to exceptions as a way to sell [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=10.0s)]
*  Republican abortion bans, a sentiment echoed by other politicians. I do believe that there [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=15.76s)]
*  should be exceptions that are made. Probably most people are about 15 weeks with all the exceptions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=21.84s)]
*  Of course you have to have some reasonable exceptions. That's the way they all talk now, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=26.4s)]
*  Republicans. Exceptions, of course there's always exceptions. You guys want exceptions, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=30.24s)]
*  we'll give you exceptions. You don't want to be harmed by abortion bans. What do they actually [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=33.04s)]
*  do though when they have the power? What do they do? We can look. Here's a test case in Texas, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=37.12s)]
*  a state with a near total ban on abortion controlled entirely by Republicans with criminal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=42.08s)]
*  penalties for doctors up to life in prison. And Kate Cox lives in Texas with her husband, two [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=46.08s)]
*  children near Dallas. She is 20 weeks pregnant, but doctors tragically just discovered the baby [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=52.08s)]
*  she is carrying has a rare genetic condition that will almost certainly result in a still birth or [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=58.32s)]
*  death soon after birth. Kate Cox asked a judge to make an exception to Texas law to allow her to get [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=64.24s)]
*  an abortion so she can protect her health and crucially also her future fertility, which is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=71.12s)]
*  threatened. Yesterday, a judge under extraordinary circumstances agreed issuing an order allowing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=75.52s)]
*  her to obtain that medical care and then immediately the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=81.36s)]
*  threatened to jail her doctor and sue the hospital or any hospital that performs it if they provide [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=87.12s)]
*  this abortion care. He is now petitioning the Texas Supreme Court to prevent Kate Cox from getting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=94.08s)]
*  the reproductive care that her doctor say she needs from getting an exception to the state's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  abortion ban. Eleanor Klebenoff is the women's health reporter for the Texas Tribune where she's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=107.28s)]
*  been closely following this story and she joins me now. Eleanor, can you just tell me a little bit [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=112.88s)]
*  more about Kate Cox and how this sort of came about? Sure, so Kate Cox is 31 years old. She [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=117.44s)]
*  lives in Dallas. She already has two kids. She and her husband really wanted this pregnancy. They were [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  excited when they found out they were pregnant and then they learned that they'd received the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=131.68s)]
*  diagnosis that no parent wants to receive. You know, that this much wanted pregnancy would not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=137.04s)]
*  result in a happy, healthy baby. In fact, probably, you know, if she delivered a baby, it would survive [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=142.16s)]
*  just hours or days. She is asking, as you said, or she asked a judge to give her an abortion and or [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=148.56s)]
*  allow her to have an abortion. And this is sort of the case that I think lawyers and advocates have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=157.12s)]
*  been waiting for in Texas to challenge these laws and see what we do now that we've got this test [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=162.48s)]
*  case. Yeah, I mean, one of the things that's so pernicious, I think, from my perspective about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=170.0s)]
*  how these laws function is that the criminal penalties are so severe, along with possible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  civil penalties, that there's a sort of just suffocating risk aversion for anyone that might [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=179.28s)]
*  try to practice this reproductive care. And people in the anti-abortion movement have said, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=186.88s)]
*  well, they're being too cautious. And actually, these are ridiculous stories that shouldn't happen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=191.12s)]
*  But then you've got Paxton making it clear that he intends to use every available tool of law [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  for retribution against the practitioner, the doctor who might actually provide Kate Cox the care she needs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Right. The state's argument is, you know, the problem is not the law. The problem is the doctors [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=211.28s)]
*  and how they're choosing to interpret the law. Then, you know, we've got this case. And as you said, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=215.6s)]
*  this doctor has basically was told by a judge that she, I mean, the doctor is named in the lawsuit [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  that said she'll be protected if she performs this abortion. And Attorney General Ken Paxton, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=227.44s)]
*  as the Center for Reproductive Rights, has framed it, you know, really trying to cow these hospitals [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  and convince them to not take on the risk of performing this abortion and sort of closing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=239.28s)]
*  all the doors available to this woman if she were to try to seek this abortion in Texas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=245.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he could obviously he doesn't have to write the letter he wrote yesterday or file the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=250.24s)]
*  petition. They're rid of mandamus today. This is the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=254.08s)]
*  representing Ms. Cox, saying that the state's mandamus position is stunning in its disregard [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=258.24s)]
*  for Ms. Cox's life, fertility and the rule of law. We should also note that this is not only [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=263.12s)]
*  happening in Texas. You're a Texas reporter. We've seen similar stories. In Florida, we saw a story [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=269.36s)]
*  of a woman in a similar situation who was forced to carry to term her fetus that gasped for air and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=276.0s)]
*  lived very briefly. That was the law. And then in Kentucky, you've got a class action suit that's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=285.52s)]
*  asking a judge to block enforcement of Kentucky's trigger law and six-weeks abortion ban. One of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=291.44s)]
*  the plaintiffs and other pregnant women who wish to no longer be pregnant are suffering mental, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=296.24s)]
*  constitutional, reprehensible harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=299.44s)]
*  We've seen a lot of legal challenges. Where does this go next? Is the Texas State Supreme [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=303.2s)]
*  Court going to weigh in on this? Yes, we are essentially waiting for the Texas Supreme Court [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=309.36s)]
*  to tell us what happens next here. You know, everyone is on the edge of their seat. You know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=315.12s)]
*  the Texas Supreme Court is also considering this larger case that has 20 plaintiffs that, you know, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=319.68s)]
*  they've already heard arguments in that case that sort of proceeding on the normal timeline. It'll [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=325.76s)]
*  be weeks or months before we get a ruling on that case. This case, for obvious reasons, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=330.0s)]
*  moving a lot faster. We expect a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court tonight, this weekend. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=334.24s)]
*  You know, we'll see. Is there, I mean, obviously Paxton is a special snowflake. You know, he is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=340.0s)]
*  notorious in Texas politics. He just survived an impeachment. He's been, he's had an indictment [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=348.56s)]
*  for a very long period of time. He's an incredibly polarizing and I would dare say a reviled figure [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=354.16s)]
*  by many, even in Republican politics in the state of Texas. Have other state leaders, Greg Abbott, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=359.44s)]
*  the senators in that state, Cornyn and Cruz, have they, have other people chimed in to say what they [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=367.44s)]
*  think should happen to this woman who is fighting to obtain the reproductive care that she needs? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=373.92s)]
*  We have not heard like widespread commentary on this case from elected leaders. I'll be honest, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=381.76s)]
*  abortion in some ways has become a little bit of a radioactive topic now that we're sort of seeing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=386.72s)]
*  how some of this plays out. Early on, right after the Dobbs decision, Governor Greg Abbott said, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  you know, he'd like to see some clarity in the law and in the exceptions. Now that that's sort [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  of playing out in front of the courts, we're probably hearing people saying, you know, they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=402.16s)]
*  just want to wait and see what the courts do. But I'll say, you know, we had a legislative session [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  earlier this year. Texas has spent most of this year in special sessions and there has not been [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=409.68s)]
*  any talk about adding to the exceptions, clarifying the exceptions, or really changing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=415.28s)]
*  anything to do with the law. So the legislators seem to be pretty much content with the way things [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=420.08s)]
*  are or at least content to see what the Texas Supreme Court does. Yeah, this is the policy [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  of the state of Texas, its legislators, its governor, its attorney general, who have put [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  this regime together that now has Ms. Cox in the situation. She's in Eleanor, Cleveland. Thank you [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  very much. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=440.32s)]
*  you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib6HJjcjxk&t=445.28s)]
