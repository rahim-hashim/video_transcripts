Video Description: Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on some Republicans opposing federal funding for the rebuilding of the Baltimore’s Key Bridge: “This really needs to be a bipartisan priority, and anybody who views it as otherwise, I’m hoping they will reconsider because it could be your district that is the next one to be struck by tragedy.”

# Buttigieg: ‘There’s nothing partisan about a road or a bridge’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY)
*  I'm directing my team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=0.0s)]
*  as soon as humanly possible. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=4.74s)]
*  We're going to work with our partners in Congress to make sure the state gets the support it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=6.32s)]
*  needs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=10.72s)]
*  It's my intention that the federal government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=11.72s)]
*  that bridge, and I expect the Congress to support my effort. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=15.56s)]
*  Within hours of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsing after the cargo ship crash, President [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=21.2s)]
*  Joe Biden pledged the federal government would take the lead on rebuilding it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=25.36s)]
*  The bridge is crucial not just for the state of Maryland or the port of Baltimore, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=29.56s)]
*  for the entire economy of the eastern seaboard. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  The bridge collapse was a disaster, and one core role of the federal government is to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=36.48s)]
*  backstop after disasters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=40.72s)]
*  At least one Republican is already balking at the idea of using federal funds to rebuild [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=42.92s)]
*  this important piece of infrastructure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=48.32s)]
*  Is Congress going to need to pony up more money, or is there enough money in the infrastructure [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=51.54s)]
*  package? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=55.72s)]
*  Great to be with you, Maria. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=57.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of outrageous immediately for Biden to express in this tragedy the idea [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=59.24s)]
*  that he's going to use federal funds to pay for the entirety. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=66.08s)]
*  It's become standard for a certain type of Republican, unfortunately, like podcaster [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=69.52s)]
*  Ted Cruz, voting against emergency relief after Superstorm Sandy, only to come hat in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=73.64s)]
*  hand to claim federal money for Texas after Hurricane Harvey even ran an ad about how [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=79.56s)]
*  much money he got. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=84.24s)]
*  And again, for the power grid disaster. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=85.82s)]
*  And in 2020, during the height of the COVID emergency, Donald Trump boasted about not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=88.86s)]
*  providing the support to governors who didn't support him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  Now with this enormous disaster in Baltimore, we once again seeing the MAGA vision of governance [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  in action, which is you only get government services if you support Donald Trump, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  screw you if you don't. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=104.82s)]
*  Joining me now is Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=105.82s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, it's great to have you on the program. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=109.74s)]
*  First, just I wanted to get a kind of brief from you on where things stand in the aftermath [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=112.42s)]
*  of this disaster in terms of knowing what caused it and what the first next few steps [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=118.14s)]
*  look like. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=123.86s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=124.86s)]
*  Well, the NTSB is leading the investigation in partnership with the Coast Guard and a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=125.86s)]
*  number of agencies that are involved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=132.14s)]
*  They're going through the black box looking at everything that could be relevant to understanding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=134.1s)]
*  the causes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=138.26s)]
*  They work independently from us by design, but we're doing everything we can to help [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=140.1s)]
*  in their effort. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=142.62s)]
*  In the meantime, our focus really is, as a department, is making sure we prepare for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=143.78s)]
*  what's next. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=148.54s)]
*  That means getting that bridge rebuilt and dealing with all of the traffic disruptions [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=149.54s)]
*  until it is, getting the port reopened, and dealing with all of the supply chain disruptions [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=153.54s)]
*  until that happens. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=158.64s)]
*  Right now, there are three heavy lift vessels on their way to the site that should begin [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=160.66s)]
*  arriving tomorrow, and the last of them should be in place a couple of days after that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=166.4s)]
*  To begin with that process of getting the wreckage cleared, you've got to understand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=171.56s)]
*  that that passage that is blocked by the ship and the bridge there, that is the only channel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=176.24s)]
*  in to most of the port of Baltimore, which is, of course, a very important port for the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=182.24s)]
*  East Coast. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  So that's why we've got to make sure that we get that cleared in a safe and responsible [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  way so that the port can get back up and running. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  And then there's the longer-term effort of making sure the bridge can get back up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Just hours ago, we released the first $60 million of federal funding to help with that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=199.12s)]
*  through our emergency relief program. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=204.04s)]
*  There's, I'm sure, going to be much more where that came from. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=206.4s)]
*  Everything it takes, as the president said, to help everyone in Baltimore get back to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=209.24s)]
*  normal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=212.76s)]
*  So clearing that ship, which is still in that channel, that's the channel that creates passage [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=213.76s)]
*  in and out of the port to get the port active again. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=218.24s)]
*  That's sort of priority number one right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=222.0s)]
*  The $60 million in quick-release emergency relief funds that got announced, I guess there's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=225.16s)]
*  a sort of pot of money for the immediate aftermath of disasters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=230.96s)]
*  And then in terms of the actual transportation logistics here, I mean, it strikes me as an [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=235.2s)]
*  enormous problem, right, to not have that bridge in terms of hazardous materials, in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=240.76s)]
*  terms of flow from the port as well. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=245.12s)]
*  Do you have a game plan for how to deal with that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=247.72s)]
*  Yeah, we've been working side by side with the Maryland DOT under the leadership of Governor [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=251.0s)]
*  Westmore as they have been putting together their plans to do the design and the procurement [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=257.4s)]
*  for the new bridge and everything it takes to get that port back up and running. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=262.4s)]
*  As you noted, this is an important thoroughfare. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=266.72s)]
*  About 30,000 vehicles a day counted on that bridge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=268.44s)]
*  There are alternatives, 95 and 895, but those are both tunnels, which are not suitable for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=271.46s)]
*  hazardous material transportation, at least most of the time, part of what makes this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=277.68s)]
*  complicated in the meantime. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=282.44s)]
*  But these are some of the things that the funds can help with, and certainly in terms [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=283.84s)]
*  of clearing that channel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=287.64s)]
*  These funds can go to demolition, debris removal, they can go to supporting some of the costs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=289.2s)]
*  associated with detours, as well as the early spending on that design and procurement of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=295.0s)]
*  a new bridge. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=299.92s)]
*  And believe it or not, even though the original bridge took five years to construct, they [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=300.92s)]
*  have already had meetings and sessions beginning yesterday to launch the procurement and design [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=306.68s)]
*  process to get it back up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=311.2s)]
*  Okay, so that was my next question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=312.72s)]
*  I mean, just looking at that bridge, that looks like an expensive, difficult to build [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=314.12s)]
*  bridge. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=318.6s)]
*  I know nothing about bridges, but just my amateur eye, it's a long expanse. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=319.6s)]
*  It also has to be built so that ships can pass in and out underneath it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=324.12s)]
*  This is a non-trivial undertaking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=328.64s)]
*  What's the timeline and the cost like? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=333.04s)]
*  And are you worried at all from the words we heard from the Republican congressman today [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  that this House Republican majority is not going to be interested in providing the funding? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=341.04s)]
*  This really needs to be a bipartisan priority, and anybody who views it as otherwise, I'm [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=349.0s)]
*  hoping they will reconsider because it could be your district that is the next one to be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  struck by tragedy, and we always do better when America comes together. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=358.72s)]
*  Let me give you one example of a situation that happened in the past. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=362.8s)]
*  In 2007, many were killed and injured when I-35 bridge collapsed in Minnesota. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=366.56s)]
*  That was not because of a ship strike or a truck strike. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=374.16s)]
*  In that case, it wasn't going over the bay the way the bridge in Baltimore is, but what [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=377.88s)]
*  it had in common was a sudden and catastrophic collapse. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=383.68s)]
*  In the end, about $260 million of federal funds were brought together, and that is something [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  that really passed very quickly and rather easily in that congress. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=393.48s)]
*  I would like to believe we can get that done now, too. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=397.44s)]
*  To be clear, things like the $60 million we put forward today, we've already got that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=401.72s)]
*  funding because it was authorized in President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure plan that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  passed back in 2021. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  But it's certainly the case that more funding might be needed. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=411.8s)]
*  Again, this really shouldn't be partisan in the least. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=414.76s)]
*  Just like the original bipartisan infrastructure law was bipartisan, we didn't have all Republicans [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=419.0s)]
*  with us, of course, but a number of Republicans crossed the aisle to work with President Biden, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=424.64s)]
*  work with Democrats, and get that done because there's nothing partisan about a road or a bridge. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=428.84s)]
*  Secretary Pete Buttigieg, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aR5ZMZ4JbY&t=433.32s)]
