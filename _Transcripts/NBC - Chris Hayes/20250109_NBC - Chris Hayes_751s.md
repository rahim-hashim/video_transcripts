# Trump loses Supreme Court bid to stop sentencing as Barrett, Roberts join liberal justices
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot happening today. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=1.94s)]
*  In just over 13 hours' time, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=2.94s)]
*  Donald Trump will be sentenced [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=4.74s)]
*  for his 34 felony convictions in New York. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  That is after the Supreme Court, within the last hour or so, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=9.84s)]
*  denied his request for a delay. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=11.98s)]
*  Now, barely. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=13.72s)]
*  The 5-4 decision just came down in the last hour. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=15.18s)]
*  Chief Justice Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=18.66s)]
*  siding with the three liberals on the court, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=21.62s)]
*  deciding that first, the alleged evidentiary violations [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=23.96s)]
*  at President-elect Trump's state court trial [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=27.1s)]
*  can be addressed in the ordinary course of appeal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  That is usually how this works. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=31.2s)]
*  Second, the burden that sentencing will impose [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=33.14s)]
*  in the President-elect's responsibilities [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  is relatively insubstantial [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=37.099999999999994s)]
*  in light of the trial court's stated intent [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  to impose a sentence of unconditional discharge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=42.54s)]
*  after a brief virtual hearing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=45.28s)]
*  Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Alito, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  who just talked to Donald Trump on the phone yesterday, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=50.459999999999994s)]
*  say they would have granted the stay. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=53.42s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  But with the 5-4 decision, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump will be the first convicted felon [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=57.28s)]
*  to become President of the United States. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=59.28s)]
*  We're just breaking barriers right and left these days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=61.0s)]
*  And he will have to appear virtually in a New York courtroom [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=63.86s)]
*  at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow morning for his sentencing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=69.9s)]
*  Kristi Greenberg served as an Assistant United States [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=72.14s)]
*  Attorney for the Southern District of New York, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=74.8s)]
*  where she was Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=76.18s)]
*  They both joined me now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=78.74s)]
*  First of all, let me just start with you on the law here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=81.08s)]
*  You and I talked, and I'll just cop to it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  I thought there was no way in heck this was gonna happen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=87.94s)]
*  He was gonna pull some rabbit out of a hat. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=89.58s)]
*  I may have even said the words, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=91.22s)]
*  I'll bet $10,000 it never happens. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=92.42s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=96.58s)]
*  He exhausted his appeals in New York court, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  So that Mershon ordered. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Then there's one intermediate appellate level. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=102.1s)]
*  They said no. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=104.3s)]
*  Then there's the ultimate appellate level. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=105.56s)]
*  They said no. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Then emergency filing the Supreme Court being like, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=107.8s)]
*  guys, help me out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  You've been there for me all along. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=111.44s)]
*  Help me out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  What was the argument his lawyers were making [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=114.88s)]
*  in the Supreme Court? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  His lawyers were making sort of two arguments, Chris. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=117.8s)]
*  One is that at the trial, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=118.64s)]
*  there was evidence introduced at the trial [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  on which the jury relied, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  for which he was entitled to immunity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  So his argument goes under the Supreme Court's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=125.72s)]
*  immunity ruling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=127.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Per John Roberts Skoda's opinion last year. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=129.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=130.62s)]
*  That not only does the president have immunity [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=132.18s)]
*  from prosecution for his official acts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=133.82s)]
*  or his core constitutional duties at least, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=136.12s)]
*  but he also has immunity from even having official acts, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=138.12s)]
*  evidence introduced in trials having purely to do [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=141.32s)]
*  with his private conduct. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=144.0s)]
*  That was his first argument. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=146.02s)]
*  His second argument was, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=147.08s)]
*  I am a president elect and the same constitutional concerns [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=148.36s)]
*  that the Department of Justice recognizes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=151.86s)]
*  with respect to sitting presidents [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=153.96s)]
*  and prosecuting them for any reason whatsoever. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=155.56s)]
*  Those should apply to me too, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=158.34s)]
*  because I am very busy with very important things [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=159.64s)]
*  under the Presidential Transition Act. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=161.3s)]
*  And you should therefore stretch your July ruling [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=162.7s)]
*  to cover this period too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=166.68s)]
*  I might run for president someday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=168.44s)]
*  I think I get immunity personally. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=169.78s)]
*  That's my new constitutional interpretation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=171.14s)]
*  Let's just keep going with this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=174.72s)]
*  You were surprised. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  You walked in, you're surprised. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  I got this wrong. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=180.6s)]
*  I really thought that they were going to bail him out [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=181.66s)]
*  once again, because that's what we've seen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=184.0s)]
*  And some cynicism was warranted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=186.04s)]
*  This was five to four. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=188.04s)]
*  There were four of these justices [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  who were prepared to help him out here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  I didn't count on the fact that justices Roberts [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=194.44s)]
*  and Amy Coney Barrett would do the right thing here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=197.27999999999997s)]
*  But even then the order itself is interesting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=200.77999999999997s)]
*  They say that the reason they're okay with this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  is because the trial court's stated intent [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=206.56s)]
*  is to impose this sentence of unconditional discharge, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=209.06s)]
*  which means nothing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=211.88s)]
*  No jail, no probation, no conditions, nothing, nada. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=213.16s)]
*  Wait, just stop on that right there, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  because that is a tip to that argument, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  So they're saying like the equities [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=219.56s)]
*  that you're bringing forth, which is I am president-elect [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=221.68s)]
*  and I do have many busy things to do, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  meetings and calls, meetings and calls down in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=226.88s)]
*  They're saying, we hear you, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=229.24s)]
*  but it's not gonna be that bad a burden. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=230.84s)]
*  But it's conceding that there's something there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=232.22s)]
*  It is conceding, yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=234.42s)]
*  And they're saying, and this sentencing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=235.94s)]
*  is going to be a brief virtual hearing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=238.22s)]
*  Those are not typically words that are associated [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=240.74s)]
*  with sentencing of criminal defendants. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=242.78s)]
*  Sentencings are not brief. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=244.7s)]
*  Sentencings usually take- We'll get you in, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=246.06s)]
*  we'll get you out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=247.02s)]
*  Right, that's not how it works [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=248.5s)]
*  for any other criminal defendant. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=250.06s)]
*  You're usually looking at at least an hour [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=251.38s)]
*  for a criminal sentencing, even in a pretty minor case. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=253.22s)]
*  And they're not virtual for any other criminal defendant. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=255.62s)]
*  They're always in person. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=258.26s)]
*  So, yes, should we take the win, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=259.68s)]
*  the fact that the sentencing is happening at all? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=263.12s)]
*  Yeah, but this is not business as usual. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=265.24s)]
*  This is not how it works for anybody else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=268.88s)]
*  Essentially, the American presidency [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=270.68s)]
*  is officially a get out of jail free card. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=272.42s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=274.68s)]
*  I have to say that I had gotten so cynical about this court [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=275.72s)]
*  that I thought, well, they'll find it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=280.16s)]
*  And I thought they were gonna issue some temporary order, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  we'll consider it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=283.68s)]
*  But of course, again, the shadow docket here [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=284.5s)]
*  and the emergency docket is so complicated procedurally [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  that I was like, oh, do they need three votes or four? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=289.76s)]
*  No, it's gonna be actually found five, four, whatever. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=291.24s)]
*  Point being, though, to your point, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  it does also feel like there are four votes for whatever. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=296.12s)]
*  Like on the record, first time, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=300.36s)]
*  This is the first Supreme Court rolling [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=302.06s)]
*  of the new Trump era. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=304.08s)]
*  This is the first, the last time he had a five, four court [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=305.32s)]
*  in his favor with Kennedy's swing voter. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=308.68s)]
*  He now has a six, three vote in his favor [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=310.36s)]
*  with Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=313.04s)]
*  as the likely defectors to make a majority of the liberals. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  And this really feels like our first look at this court [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=319.52s)]
*  where there's four votes for like, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=323.64s)]
*  do whatever you wanna do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=326.12s)]
*  It's a pretty dire. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=328.32s)]
*  I mean, do you feel that way? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  Or is that, am I being... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=330.92s)]
*  No, look, I'm a Pollyanna, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=331.76s)]
*  and so I will always see the upside of this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=333.28s)]
*  The upside to me is that they tried to stretch [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=336.28s)]
*  the meaning of the July presidential immunity decision [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=339.36s)]
*  far beyond that which John Roberts, who was its author, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=342.04s)]
*  intended for it to go. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=344.8s)]
*  And therefore, I think it backfired on them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=346.36s)]
*  So in that respect, I was gratified to see that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=349.16s)]
*  We have some breaking legal news. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=353.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=354.36s)]
*  Do you know this? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=355.2s)]
*  Yes, the 11th Circuit. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=356.02s)]
*  Okay, so the 11th Circuit, which is the circuit [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=356.86s)]
*  that was reviewing a application by Donald Trump [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=360.72s)]
*  to stop the report from Jack Smith's office [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=365.2s)]
*  from coming out, has denied the request [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=369.08s)]
*  by Trump's co-defendants to block the release [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=371.0s)]
*  of special counsel Jack Smith's report, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=373.32s)]
*  to left in place the three-day delay [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=374.74s)]
*  that Judge Edeling Cannon instituted [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=376.98s)]
*  to allow for further appeals. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=378.52s)]
*  So at the circuit court level, on the Dock's case, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=380.18s)]
*  they're saying, you don't get to stop Jack Smith [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  from releasing this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=385.74s)]
*  We're gonna leave in place this three-day delay [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=387.04s)]
*  that Cannon put in that no one could find precedent for. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=389.48s)]
*  They're saying it's sort of procedurally, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=393.58s)]
*  look, if you wanted to appeal her order, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  you should have appealed it directly, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=397.76s)]
*  and therefore that three-day period [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=399.26s)]
*  is going to stay in place sort of as a default, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=401.42s)]
*  but it also gives Trump time, obviously, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=404.44s)]
*  to now run to the Supreme Court [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  because there's going to be a three-day wait. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=408.46s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=409.92s)]
*  So they may, we might, there's gonna be a SCOTUS writ petition [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=410.76s)]
*  and they're gonna get another, already, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=414.48s)]
*  he's not even in office yet, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=416.08s)]
*  and there's gonna be another swing here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=417.72s)]
*  This one, I mean, again, Judge Cannon's order [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=421.12s)]
*  was so absurd. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=424.68s)]
*  I mean, first, the case wasn't even before her. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=425.72s)]
*  She had already dismissed it, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=427.9s)]
*  and she issues this order to say the whole report [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=429.12s)]
*  can't be released, even the January 6th part, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=431.36s)]
*  which wasn't even before her. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=434.52s)]
*  So again, this one, I feel fairly confident, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  at least with respect to the January 6th report, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=439.12s)]
*  which Merrick Garland has said they intend to release, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=441.12s)]
*  that that will be released [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=444.2s)]
*  and that the Supreme Court won't block it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=445.52s)]
*  We should also make the point here [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=447.08s)]
*  that I'm not sure how, I mean, in terms of the Dock's case, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=448.08s)]
*  like, we all read the indictment. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=451.84s)]
*  Like, there's a, it's not like we're gonna learn something [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=453.2s)]
*  shockingly new in this report, most likely. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  It seems more to me about the, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=458.08s)]
*  under you were shaking your head. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=459.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, go ahead. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=460.96s)]
*  Okay, I'm wrong, please. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  So one of the things that Jack Smith said [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=463.76s)]
*  is that he had unclassified evidence [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=466.32s)]
*  that he intended to prove at trial [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  that would say why Donald Trump [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=471.32s)]
*  had these classified documents in the first place, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=473.76s)]
*  what he intended to do with them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=475.76s)]
*  That to me has always been the $64,000 question. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=478.24s)]
*  Was he just holding them as trophies [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=481.08s)]
*  or did he intend to sell them? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=483.24s)]
*  Like, what was he doing? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=484.9s)]
*  Why was it so important for him to keep these? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=486.24s)]
*  And the fact, like, if we could get answers [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=488.68s)]
*  to those questions from Jack Smith in this report, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=491.76s)]
*  that would have real value there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  So there's a reason, I would think, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=496.36s)]
*  why Donald Trump's team is trying so hard [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=498.36s)]
*  to keep this from being released. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=501.52s)]
*  And unfortunately, Merrick Garland has agreed, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  with respect to the classified documents case, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=505.58s)]
*  that we're not going to see it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=507.68s)]
*  They don't intend to release it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=508.8s)]
*  because there are these two co-defendants [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  where they're still pursuing an appeal. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  But honestly, Donald Trump's DOJ [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=514.0s)]
*  is gonna dismiss the charges against them anyway. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  So if you're weighing the public interest here, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  go ahead and drop the case against them [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  and let us see the classified documents report. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  I would say, I wanna see the classified documents report [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=525.1199999999999s)]
*  for a slightly different reason. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a cast of characters here [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=528.68s)]
*  who witnessed the behavior or participated with him. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=530.1199999999999s)]
*  And many of those people are scheduled [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=533.0s)]
*  to take important roles in the next Trump administration. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=534.88s)]
*  Handling classified information. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  Including Suzy Wiles, who is PAC representative [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=538.56s)]
*  in the indictment, including Cash Patel, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=541.16s)]
*  who at one point in time was the designated liaison [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=543.04s)]
*  between the former Trump administration [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=546.02s)]
*  and the National Archives. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=548.08s)]
*  So for those kinds of reasons, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=549.2s)]
*  I would be really interested in seeing it [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  because think about how much we learned [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=553.24s)]
*  from the Mueller report with respect to all [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  of the witnesses and the documentation [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=557.0200000000001s)]
*  and the back and forth between people. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what I really wanna see here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=560.48s)]
*  Even if we could never get classified information. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=562.2s)]
*  All right, that's a really good point. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  So now let's go back to, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  sorry, I'm keeping a lot of balls in the air today. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=567.44s)]
*  Let's go back to the sentencing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=570.32s)]
*  So just walk me through what happens tomorrow at 9.30. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=572.08s)]
*  Tomorrow at 9.30 when we walk in, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=576.0s)]
*  we will see a screen in all likelihood [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=578.12s)]
*  where Todd Blanche is with his client, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=580.04s)]
*  Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=582.52s)]
*  Maybe they choose like a cool Zoom background. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=584.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=586.88s)]
*  The American flag. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=587.72s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=588.56s)]
*  Yeah, Rudy Giuliani was instructed by a judge [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=589.64s)]
*  the other day to get rid of his American flag background. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=591.6s)]
*  Which is the joke Christie is making. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=594.24s)]
*  But I think what we'll hear from first [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=595.92s)]
*  is we'll hear from the prosecution. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=597.84s)]
*  Then the defense will have an opportunity to speak. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=599.68s)]
*  And then he will give Trump himself [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=602.24s)]
*  an opportunity to speak. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=604.32s)]
*  And what's crazy about that is, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  Chris, I've been at two trials already [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=607.14s)]
*  where Donald Trump has had an opportunity to speak. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=608.66s)]
*  One is a witness, the other he wanted to make a statement. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=610.62s)]
*  In both cases, he ended up getting into skirmishes [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=612.78s)]
*  with those judges about talking too long [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=615.5s)]
*  and about things that he had already been precluded [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=617.54s)]
*  from talking about. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  What happens when he's virtual? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=620.3s)]
*  What does Judge Marchand do? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=621.78s)]
*  Like just cut the feed? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=623.18s)]
*  That's sort of an open question [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=625.66s)]
*  about how this all unfolds tomorrow. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  But ultimately, and I think this is the part [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=628.2199999999999s)]
*  that Christie knows best and the lengthiest part [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  is he will deliver a recitation of his reasons [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=632.42s)]
*  for imposing the sentence that he says he's going to impose [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=636.02s)]
*  and at the end, sentence him officially [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=637.9s)]
*  to this unconditional discharge as we're all expecting. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=640.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and we've gotten a preview already [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=643.38s)]
*  of some of what Judge Marchand will say. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=645.6600000000001s)]
*  In his opinion, he says that this crime [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=647.38s)]
*  from Donald Trump, these 34 felonies, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=650.7s)]
*  represents the premeditated and continuous deception [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=652.98s)]
*  by the leader of the free world. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=656.34s)]
*  Like, that's a pretty strong statement [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=658.62s)]
*  about how he views the gravity of this offense. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=661.38s)]
*  And again, that's not normally something you would think [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=664.42s)]
*  is going to be met with no consequences whatsoever [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=667.9399999999999s)]
*  in terms of punishment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=671.42s)]
*  Just remember, again, to be kind of the Debbie Downer here, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=672.58s)]
*  yes, it's good we're having a sentencing, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=674.98s)]
*  but in a way, this is not the sentencing [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=676.5s)]
*  that he should be getting. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=679.06s)]
*  He should be getting punished. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=680.1s)]
*  Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=681.18s)]
*  for making this payment at the direction [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=683.34s)]
*  and for the benefit of Donald Trump. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=685.82s)]
*  And he's somebody who pled guilty. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=687.9399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump went to trial. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=689.66s)]
*  Michael Cohen accepted responsibility. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=691.3s)]
*  Donald Trump has been in contempt [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=693.2s)]
*  of the gag order several times. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=694.6400000000001s)]
*  So this is something that you would expect [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  if he were not going to be president in 17 days, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  he would have gone to jail for. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  So I expect also, if it's not Donald Trump, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=706.12s)]
*  certainly his lawyers are going to go after Judge Marchand. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=709.4000000000001s)]
*  Their filings have been replete with statements [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=712.96s)]
*  about how he is acting unlawfully, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=716.24s)]
*  how he is acting unconstitutionally. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=718.36s)]
*  You don't normally see that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  You can say to the judge, you got it wrong [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=721.0s)]
*  and we're going to appeal, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=722.48s)]
*  but you don't usually hear, hey, you're breaking the law. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think you're going to see fireworks. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=726.72s)]
*  Over Zoom. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=728.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLUKhqDcq8&t=730.0s)]
