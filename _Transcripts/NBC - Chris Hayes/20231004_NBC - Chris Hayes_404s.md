# ‘Ludicrous on its face’ Neguse says blaming Democrats for GOP disarray is ‘nonsensical’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE)
*  Congressman Joe Neguse is a Democrat of Colorado, a member of his party's leadership, and he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=0.0s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=4.92s)]
*  First of all, what do you think of the argument that you sold out the country yesterday in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=7.88s)]
*  pursuit of petty political aims and had an opportunity to be the bigger man, I guess? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=12.6s)]
*  I don't know what the argument is and vote to keep Kevin McCarthy as your speaker. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=18.96s)]
*  Well, good evening, Chris. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=24.6s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  It's a nonsensical argument. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=28.68s)]
*  I agree with your summation as to the decision making that occurred over the course of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=30.2s)]
*  last couple of days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=35.0s)]
*  Let me just first say I think it's important as a broad principle to state what has been [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=36.0s)]
*  made abundantly clear over the course of the last nine months, which is that House Republicans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  are singularly focused on fighting each other and House Democrats are focused on fighting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=44.8s)]
*  for the American people, on delivering real results for working families across our country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=49.24s)]
*  Now, it's unfortunate that House Republicans chose a different path, that path of chaos [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=53.64s)]
*  and extremism and dysfunction has had real consequences for the American people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=58.4s)]
*  You outlined some of them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=63.4s)]
*  And of course, it culminated in the events of the last 24 hours. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=64.4s)]
*  With respect to the particular argument that you're noting that some Republicans have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=67.56s)]
*  apparently are parroting and using it as an excuse over the last 24 hours, I think it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=73.16s)]
*  is ludicrous on its face. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=78.44s)]
*  The notion that Democrats are somehow responsible for electing a Republican speaker is unmoored [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=80.4s)]
*  from reality and from any kind of historical precedence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=86.16s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, Chris, of course, the American people understand that they recognize [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=89.32s)]
*  that the majority party in the House selects the speaker because they watched in January [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  when the Republican conference was in disarray, incapable of electing a speaker. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=98.56s)]
*  And the only reason why that process concluded with the ascension of Speaker McCarthy is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=103.1s)]
*  because he capitulated to every demand made by the extreme right wing of his caucus, including [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=108.08s)]
*  the rule change that you noted that enabled those same chaos agents to ultimately vacate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=113.16s)]
*  the speaker's office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  And that was a rule change that House Democrats voted against. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=122.02s)]
*  So it's a crisis of their own making. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=125.2s)]
*  It is emblematic of the dysfunction that they have brought to Washington. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=127.44s)]
*  And it's unfortunate for the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=131.5s)]
*  The other thing in this, the guy named Aaron Fisher, who's a staffer, wrote this thread. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=133.72s)]
*  One of the things that he I thought did a really good job of explaining to is that this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  The CR that they passed is a continuing resolution to keep the government open on the day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=141.08s)]
*  There was no communication. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=145.44000000000003s)]
*  He's been promising the right everything. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=147.28s)]
*  He suddenly pivots, throws this thing in your laps. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=148.56s)]
*  Here's all the funding you've got. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  You don't have 90 minutes, not even 90 minutes to read it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  Vote for it or you've shut down the government and I need a two thirds majority. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=157.56s)]
*  That's the last thing he did before he got booted from being speaker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=160.56s)]
*  That was the last action of the guy that you're supposed to have any trust or good faith in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=166.02s)]
*  Yeah, with one caveat, Chris, it was the second to last thing he did, because, of course, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=171.6s)]
*  the last thing he did was following that vote in which the vast majority of Democrats, nearly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=176.72s)]
*  99 percent of our caucus, voted in favor of keeping the government open, notwithstanding [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=181.84s)]
*  that Republicans in mass voted against it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=187.04s)]
*  The speaker, former speaker, then went on television and attempted to blame Democrats [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=190.08s)]
*  for voting, I guess, apparently for voting for that bill. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  So I read that same Twitter thread that you referenced and I thought it articulated well [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=198.0s)]
*  the numerous ways in which, unfortunately, the former speaker had, as I said, capitulated [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  to the far right, had reneged on agreements that were made. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=207.72s)]
*  But again, this is bigger than one person. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  It is emblematic of the extremism that has taken root in the House Republican conference. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=213.33999999999997s)]
*  That fundamentally, I think, is what's before the country now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=218.92s)]
*  Yeah, and these are the eight, we should just put up the eight Republicans that voted to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=222.48s)]
*  oust him that were sort of running this operation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=226.68s)]
*  To your point about being bigger than one speaker, I don't want to get too in the weeds [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=230.12s)]
*  here, but I think it's just important for people to understand, like, tangibly the issue [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=232.72s)]
*  here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  The government's going to need to be funded in 45 days because there's a continuing resolution [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  passed for 45 days. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  There was a deal laid out at the debt ceiling for the House and the Senate for basically [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=241.28s)]
*  these kind of top-line budget numbers, for everyone to go back and pass appropriations [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=246.24s)]
*  that are in line with those numbers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=250.12s)]
*  That was the deal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=251.4s)]
*  We all watched it happen. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=252.4s)]
*  We covered it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=253.52s)]
*  McCarthy met with Joe Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=254.52s)]
*  The Senate is doing that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=256.4s)]
*  They're basically going back and saying, OK, this is what this is. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=258.0s)]
*  We got the Ag bill. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=260.35999999999996s)]
*  We got the defense bill. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's the top line numbers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=262.64s)]
*  The Republicans want to renege on that deal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  They want to rip up that deal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=268.12s)]
*  And so there will be another shutdown because they want to rip up the deal that they made [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=270.56s)]
*  to avoid the last shutdown. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  Am I right or am I losing my mind? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, no, look, the House Republicans have been on an island for quite some time now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  You are right with respect to the deal that you mentioned. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=283.52s)]
*  The fiscal responsibility act, the impetus for that deal, just by way of background and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=286.68s)]
*  context, I think for your viewers, is that the Republicans manufactured a crisis with [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=291.0s)]
*  respect to the debt ceiling. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  They brought us to the brink of a catastrophic default on our debt and then ultimately negotiated [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  this agreement to avert that crisis they had created. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  And in a mere matter of weeks, Speaker McCarthy, former Speaker McCarthy reneged on that very [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=305.6s)]
*  same deal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  Senate Republicans have been working on a bipartisan basis with Senate Democrats, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  the Senate, of course, is supportive of the agreement that he reached. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=315.92s)]
*  But again, it's consistent with the way in which the House Republican conference has [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=317.92s)]
*  chosen to govern, which in our lack thereof, I suppose that these are not serious people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not a serious party. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=327.24s)]
*  They are not prepared to govern. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=328.24s)]
*  The American people see that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=329.92s)]
*  And unfortunately, if past is prologue, I think that we're in for some choppy waters [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=331.44s)]
*  ahead. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=336.56s)]
*  I'm hopeful that some Republicans in that conference will walk away from the extreme [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=337.56s)]
*  maga, you know, sort of element in the caucus that has metastasized and work with us to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  find a bipartisan path forward, again, supporting our leader, Hakeem Jeffries, who has led our [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=347.88s)]
*  conference in the country with unity and with vision and I think strategic brilliance of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=352.84s)]
*  really trying to deliver results to the American people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=357.44s)]
*  But time will tell. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=359.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think choppy waters is apt. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=361.0s)]
*  And again, we're going to be in the same place. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=365.12s)]
*  Like, it doesn't matter who they get. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=366.44s)]
*  They could, you know, they could they could vote for the Hamburglar for speaker. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=367.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=372.76s)]
*  It's going to be the same problem. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=373.76s)]
*  Congressman Joe Noguist always always try to get you to smile before and laugh before [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  we leave. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=379.32s)]
*  I succeeded today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=380.32s)]
*  Thank you, Congress. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=381.32s)]
*  Always good to be with you, Chris. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=382.32s)]
*  You too. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXSNHMJJpE&t=383.32s)]
