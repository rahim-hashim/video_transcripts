Video Description: After saving her daughter’s life during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Yarden Roman-Gat is missing. Her family and the Israeli military believe she was captured and taken to Gaza. Her brother, Gili Roman, joins Chris Hayes. “It is a basic duty for all of us to bring them back home because this is not something that we can allow to happen in the world, this new standard of terrorism of kidnapping,” says Roman.

# ‘New standard of terrorism’ Brother of Israeli hostage speaks out
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww)
*  Yesterday, President Biden called for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=0.0s)]
*  allow for more time to rescue or release hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=4.08s)]
*  According to the Israeli military, more than 240 people are still being held nearly a month [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  after Hamas' attack on southern Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=13.48s)]
*  One of them is Yarden Ramangat. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=16.48s)]
*  On October 7th, Yarden, her husband, Alon, and their three-year-old daughter, Gafen, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=18.8s)]
*  were visiting family in Kibbutz Bari, a small town near the border with Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=23.64s)]
*  Hamas terrorists attacked the community, massacring 120 people, including children. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=28.12s)]
*  They kidnapped others, including Yarden, Alon, and Gafen, driving them towards Gaza in a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  car stolen from the Kibbutz. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Just before they reached the border, some of the gunmen got out of the car and the family [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  tried to run away. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=44.56s)]
*  As they fled with shots flying at them, Yarden handed her daughter to her husband. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=45.56s)]
*  Her husband managed to reach the woods where he hid with his little daughter, Gafen, until [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=51.84s)]
*  the next morning when they found Israeli soldiers and were taken to safety. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=56.04s)]
*  Yarden, however, was missing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=60.2s)]
*  Her family and the military believe she was recaptured and taken into Gaza after saving [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=62.28s)]
*  her daughter's life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=66.96s)]
*  Gili Roman is Yarden's brother, who has been working tirelessly to bring her home, and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=68.6s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=73.36s)]
*  It's so good to have you here, and I first just want to express my profound grief and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=74.36s)]
*  sorrow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=78.24s)]
*  What happened to your sister? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=79.24s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=80.24s)]
*  Lots of people have all of them in their hearts and minds during this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=81.44s)]
*  Tell me about what your sister's like. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=86.28s)]
*  You're the older brother? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=87.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=88.6s)]
*  What kind of person is she? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=89.6s)]
*  She's the person that would not like me to talk about her on TV. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=91.56s)]
*  She's a very timid and introvert person, a very caring person. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=96.8s)]
*  She's a physiotherapist, so she likes to take care of people, mostly elderly people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=104.08s)]
*  This is her expertise. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=108.68s)]
*  She's a very family-oriented person, so she mostly likes our own little circle of family. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=111.4s)]
*  We have two other little siblings, a younger brother and a younger sister. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=117.0s)]
*  Our mother passed away 10 months ago from cancer, and Yarden really held our family [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  together, making sure that we are still one unit together. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=128.08s)]
*  We just finished a three-week trip with her and her family to South Africa. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=133.96s)]
*  We came back a day before it happened. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=138.4s)]
*  She recently moved out of the kibbutz and was back visiting family on her husband's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=142.24s)]
*  side. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=146.72s)]
*  True. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=147.72s)]
*  They lived in the kibbutz, and she was not willing to tolerate what we call the routine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=148.72s)]
*  Hopefully we'll never call it again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=151.28s)]
*  The rockets in her head. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  She thought it's unacceptable to live like this, and they left just a few weeks before. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=155.84s)]
*  How was it first communicated to you and your family that the Israeli government believes [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=163.26s)]
*  she had been taken hostage? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, it didn't work exactly like this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  What happened is that we got most of the information. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=171.6s)]
*  We found out that she is missing, that she's been taken out of the home due to information [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  that we got from other family members. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  You were doing the information gathering as opposed to the other way around. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=182.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=186.89999999999998s)]
*  For example, it's hard to say, but we've seen a video of her mother in L'Occitane [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  being taken out of the house. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  We knew that they had been taken. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=195.06s)]
*  A few days later, we saw another video of Kinneret being killed in the end of the street [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=196.94s)]
*  of the house on the ground in her own pool of blood. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=201.82s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=206.06s)]
*  After we've learned the story from Alon, after he'd been rescued and getting into Israeli [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=208.94s)]
*  troops, I've been through the whole week in Beirut in the area with our military trying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=214.9s)]
*  to make them go and search for her. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=222.18s)]
*  Every day I was there from morning to night going with them and trying to make them search. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=225.38s)]
*  All the information that we have, all the evidence we have, I have it first-handedly, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=230.22s)]
*  and we gave that to the government for them to conclude. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=233.62s)]
*  What has the communication, obviously it must just be unbearable to not know where she is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=238.06s)]
*  and if she's safe, and there's other families in this same situation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=245.74s)]
*  Of course, too many families. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=249.06s)]
*  Talking with each other. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=250.06s)]
*  What is the government, what are they saying to you about what is being done about the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=251.78s)]
*  prospects of her being released? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=256.18s)]
*  When you saw some of the hostages released, how did that hit you? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=258.98s)]
*  A lot of questions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=262.82s)]
*  I will start with the last one. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=263.82s)]
*  I think that obviously when I saw the hostages released, I was very happy for them because [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=265.22s)]
*  I think it's the most happy moment probably in their life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=270.34s)]
*  I was also happy to see that it's possible because until it happened, we didn't know [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=275.74s)]
*  if there is a channel that it can be done. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=279.94s)]
*  We know right now that it's possible to rescue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=282.1s)]
*  It's a proof of concept, as it were. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=284.42s)]
*  Also we saw that it's possible to rescue some of the people by the idea, so it's a positive [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=287.06s)]
*  note. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, I don't read too much into it because Hamas is a very manipulative, dangerous, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  maniac organization. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=299.3s)]
*  The fact that they are being treated in a certain way doesn't mean almost anything to me about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=301.86s)]
*  how my sister is being treated. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=305.98s)]
*  She might be tortured or got to be raped every day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=309.1s)]
*  She might be in a very isolated place, different from the others, so I cannot read too much [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=312.82s)]
*  into it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=316.66s)]
*  I try to stay pretty balanced with all the manipulation that Hamas is trying to make [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=317.66s)]
*  us go through. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=325.1s)]
*  Basically, my sister and also us are still under continuous terror attack. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=326.1s)]
*  She's under physical terror attack, but we are under mental and psychological mental [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=331.98s)]
*  attacks that have not been stopped until today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=336.78s)]
*  This is how I experienced this incident. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=341.58s)]
*  Regarding the way that we communicate with the Israeli authorities, they don't share [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  a lot of information with us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=350.38s)]
*  I think that maybe it is wise. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  You might be surprised because I believe in our forces and I believe that they are doing [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=354.85999999999996s)]
*  their utmost best. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=360.05999999999995s)]
*  If they are doing that, I think it's better that they will not tell me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  I will not be able to tell you on TV what is happening. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=366.18s)]
*  We do get some feedback that they are investing a lot in intelligence and also in the way [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=371.38s)]
*  that they operate and make the military decision that they conclude in a top priority the hostages, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=377.5s)]
*  which is a very big concern. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=384.06s)]
*  Either the hostages are in top priority or not. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=386.82s)]
*  We believe they are at the moment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=390.18s)]
*  I see a very central role also to the US government, also the German government. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=393.3s)]
*  Tirden is also a dual citizen. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=399.02000000000004s)]
*  She's also German, so we are spending much time in Germany. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=400.58s)]
*  We see a lot of commitment from those two countries and other Western countries. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  I think it's vital because it is a basic duty of all of us to bring them back home [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=407.66s)]
*  because this is not something that we can allow to happen in the world. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=415.7s)]
*  This new standard of terrorism, of kidnapping so many people, if that will be tolerated [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=420.3s)]
*  by the West, not just by us as Israelis, but by the whole West, that will be a disaster. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=426.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  Your husband, Alon, and the daughter, how is her daughter doing? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  hard, mostly at nights for Geffen, but she's very cooperative and also Alon is super strong [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=446.3s)]
*  and resourceful. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=454.7s)]
*  Geffen is acting amazingly. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=455.7s)]
*  She's cooperative. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=458.94s)]
*  She's happy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=459.94s)]
*  She's nice. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=460.94s)]
*  I think the reason for that is because she's aware. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=461.94s)]
*  She knows everything that happened, but she's aware that we are all doing our utmost efforts [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_fZI0ChHww&t=465.38s)]
