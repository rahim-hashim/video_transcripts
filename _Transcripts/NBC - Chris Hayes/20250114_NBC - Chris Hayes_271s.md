# Jeffries slams GOP ‘scheme’: They’re ‘not serious’ about lowering grocery costs
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE)
*  I think all of this is meant to create a reconciliation vehicle in which every single priority of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republicans can be put into one bill and passed, I think they're banking on this, by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=6.96s)]
*  a two or three vote party line margin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=12.34s)]
*  What's your plan to stop that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=16.28s)]
*  We're willing as House Democrats to find bipartisan common ground with the incoming administration [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=19.44s)]
*  and our Republican colleagues on any issue, whenever and wherever possible, in order to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=27.319999999999997s)]
*  make life better for the American people, particularly as it relates to driving down [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=32.0s)]
*  the high cost of living. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=37.32s)]
*  But at the same period of time, it appears that our Republican colleagues aren't really [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=39.8s)]
*  serious about lowering housing costs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=43.84s)]
*  They're not serious about lowering child care costs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  They certainly are not serious about lowering health care costs or bringing down the cost [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=48.8s)]
*  of groceries. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=53.94s)]
*  We've not seen a single plan since the election. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=55.28s)]
*  What they do want to do, Chris, is to pass massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=59.4s)]
*  corporations and then they want working families and middle class folks and the poor, the sick [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=66.72s)]
*  and the afflicted to pay for it, saddle us with trillions of dollars of debt and at the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=73.36s)]
*  same time, cut things like Medicaid or nutritional assistance for children and families and veterans [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  benefits. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to tolerate it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  The votes will not be there for this type of scheme on the Democratic side. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=88.64s)]
*  And we believe that we're going to have to take this fight to the public domain, make [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  sure we can win the battle for public sentiment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=99.84s)]
*  And the reality is, if we're successful in that endeavor, then I don't believe with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  their narrow Republican margin, they can pass anything close to what is being discussed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=107.36s)]
*  by the Speaker or by House Republicans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=113.34s)]
*  On the upside, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg personally and their companies would [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=115.96s)]
*  probably pay a lot less in taxes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=120.3s)]
*  There's always that on the other side of the ledger. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=121.88s)]
*  I want to ask you about relief for the folks in California. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=124.88s)]
*  Obviously Governor Newsom saying, and I think this has proved to be true, this is likely [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=128.28s)]
*  to be the most expensive natural disaster, climate disaster in the history of the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=132.64s)]
*  I've already seen multiple Republicans both in the Senate and the House say, well, we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=139.28s)]
*  got to see what we're going to get back from these Californians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=143.64s)]
*  Well, we're going to put some strings attached. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=145.92s)]
*  We're going to tell California how California should govern itself because we don't like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  the way California does it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=154.68s)]
*  Of course, nothing like that for the folks in North Carolina or in the Southeast who [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=155.84s)]
*  were hit by disasters earlier this year, nothing like that in Texas after the freeze, as there [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  should be, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  You should get relief. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  What is your position and the caucus's position on strings attached to disaster relief to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  California? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=171.28s)]
*  We had a discussion about this today in the House Democratic caucus and the consensus [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=172.28s)]
*  position I think it's fair to say is that we do not support conditioning any aid to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  everyday Americans whose lives have been wiped out as a result of extreme weather events [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=186.4s)]
*  and in this case in California by these raging wildfires. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  Homes have been destroyed, schools have been destroyed, small businesses have been destroyed, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=196.8s)]
*  churches and synagogues and mosques have been destroyed or are in harm's way, and it is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=202.28s)]
*  unconscionable that Republicans are suggesting imposing right-wing partisan conditions in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=210.4s)]
*  order for California taxpayers to receive their tax dollars. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  California is one of those states, in fact, that sends about five times as much to the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  federal government every year than they get back in return. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  And so we've got to be there for the people of California. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=234.12s)]
*  We will be there for the people of California just as we have been for others across the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=237.4s)]
*  country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=241.96s)]
*  That is the social contract in my view. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=242.96s)]
*  Senator Tommy Terrible of Alabama should look up that ratio for his state. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=244.8s)]
*  It might be interesting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=247.56s)]
*  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, thank you very much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w644swCbsE&t=248.56s)]
