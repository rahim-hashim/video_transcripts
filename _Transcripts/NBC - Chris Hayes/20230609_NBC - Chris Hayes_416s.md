# How Walt Nauta, Trump’s 'body man' turned co-conspirator, could hurt Trump's case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI)
*  And this is the other person who's indicted in this case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Walt Nauta. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=4.0s)]
*  And here are his crimes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=5.14s)]
*  And his crime is in bold twice, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=6.74s)]
*  where he is in an interview. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=9.68s)]
*  It's a voluntary interview with the FBI. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=11.22s)]
*  He's served in the Navy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=15.18s)]
*  He's supposed to know it's a crime to lie in this discussion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=17.28s)]
*  And he's asked, this is a guy who's been moving the boxes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=21.36s)]
*  He knows exactly where they are. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=24.22s)]
*  He's been delivering them to Trump's office [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=25.6s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=28.0s)]
*  He knows which one Trump is looking at today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=29.26s)]
*  So he says this when they say to him, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=31.32s)]
*  do you have any information that could help us understand [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=34.06s)]
*  like where they were kept, how they were kept, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  where they were secured, were they locked? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  You know, something that makes the intelligence community [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=41.300000000000004s)]
*  feel better about these things, you know? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=43.28s)]
*  And he says, I wish, I wish I could tell you, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=45.3s)]
*  I don't know, I don't, I just, I honestly just don't. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=48.32s)]
*  This is the guy, this is the box guy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=51.34s)]
*  Like his whole life has been the boxes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  for the last couple of months. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=55.52s)]
*  The final question to him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  So that sentence is in bold, because that's a crime. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=58.38s)]
*  The final sentence is, is so, so you didn't know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  You have no idea how they got there before. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=64.46s)]
*  And he says, no. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=66.66s)]
*  And the word no is bolded because that too is his crime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=68.0s)]
*  And I just want to encourage the audience. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=71.4s)]
*  That's how easy this thing is legally and to read. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=73.6s)]
*  He'll be selling bound copies of it on- [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=76.98s)]
*  We're actually holding an audio book version. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=78.7s)]
*  Well, of course you, an industrious man that you are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=81.94s)]
*  Page eight, you see the agencies that have information [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=85.1s)]
*  that's been compromised here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=88.8s)]
*  This is not the PTA. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  This is the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=93.24s)]
*  That's the analysis of imagery, imagery intelligence [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=96.82s)]
*  and geospatial information [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=99.48s)]
*  in support of national security objectives. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=101.36s)]
*  The Department of Energy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=103.48s)]
*  in terms of nuclear deterrent information. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=104.7s)]
*  The Department of State and Bureau of Intelligence [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=107.0s)]
*  and Research, this is serious information. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=108.96s)]
*  And I go back to Walt Nauta, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  who is the only other person named in this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  And at once it's the mendacity, so flagrant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=116.02s)]
*  It's hard to have pity for this person. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=118.86s)]
*  At the same time- [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=120.56s)]
*  I've got a fair amount. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=121.52s)]
*  I've got a fair amount. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=122.36s)]
*  And knowing firsthand, some of the people who work, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=123.5s)]
*  these Navy guys who work as aides to the president, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=127.6s)]
*  as who work as ballots, who work as body men, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=130.34s)]
*  this is the honor of a lifetime for them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=132.84s)]
*  And the way in which I can only presume [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=135.54s)]
*  Donald Trump took advantage of this man's allegiance [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=138.0s)]
*  to his president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=141.8s)]
*  And the fact that he was willing to lie so flagrantly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=143.44s)]
*  to Department of Justice investigators [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=146.7s)]
*  is an American tragedy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=148.34s)]
*  And by the way, there is a moment in this document [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=149.84s)]
*  where they talk about Donald Trump having a phone call [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=152.48s)]
*  with Walt Nauta for about 29 seconds [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=155.12s)]
*  after which he moves boxes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=158.48s)]
*  They're told on May 11th, there's a subpoena, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=160.12s)]
*  you gotta give him back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=162.22s)]
*  Corker says, give him back. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=163.06s)]
*  Walt Nauta is the one who does these moves from May, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=164.3s)]
*  he does them on May 24th, he moves three of them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=168.0s)]
*  May 31st, he moves another 50. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=170.52s)]
*  June 1st, he moves 11 more. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=173.56s)]
*  June 2nd, he moves 30 more. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=175.62s)]
*  And then in July, the FBI and the grand jury [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=178.0s)]
*  obtained and reviewed surveillance video [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=182.44s)]
*  from the Mar-a-Lago Club showing the movement of boxes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=184.64s)]
*  And so Donald Trump, and I think in all things [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=188.14s)]
*  large and small, Donald Trump's habit, like a mob boss, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=190.24s)]
*  is to get someone like Walt Nauta [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=193.88s)]
*  to do the dirty work for him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=196.62s)]
*  He's instructing him before each of these movements [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  of boxes, including him talking to some woman [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=201.44s)]
*  who could be Melania or maybe could be Ivanka, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  we were debating it earlier, and he's told, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  you know what, there's not enough room on the plane [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=209.82s)]
*  because we're gonna put, for all these boxes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=211.46s)]
*  to go to Bedminster, and he's like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=213.66s)]
*  oh no, he's gonna go through them, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=215.52s)]
*  he's not gonna want the whole box. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=216.76s)]
*  He is the one communicating and physically moving the boxes, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=218.22s)]
*  he's caught on tape, and then he's the one interviewed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=221.86s)]
*  by the FBI and lies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  This guy, I mean, it's hard not to feel a bit of pity [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=227.3s)]
*  for him because he's the little guy, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=230.34s)]
*  Trump obviously is paying his legal bills, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=232.6s)]
*  but he faces the exact same consequences [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=234.54s)]
*  as somebody who is so rich and had so much power. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=237.54s)]
*  And the two men are gonna be in a courthouse [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=240.38s)]
*  standing next to each other like the Home Alone Burger [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=242.48s)]
*  on Tuesday morning. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=245.62s)]
*  That's an additional legal problem for Donald Trump [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=247.36s)]
*  because if he were a standalone defendant, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=249.86s)]
*  I actually think he'd be in a better position [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=252.62s)]
*  when and if sentencing comes around. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=255.08s)]
*  Because this guy, people have gone to prison [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=258.22s)]
*  for what this guy has done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=261.92s)]
*  And the idea that like, well, there is no principle [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=264.16s)]
*  that says, oh no, no, you can't convict a Navy veteran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=267.1s)]
*  of a crime, you know, all of this kind of mythology [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=270.66s)]
*  that surrounds the notion of convicting a former president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=274.4s)]
*  So I actually think them having a co-defendant in there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=277.2s)]
*  who is by all previous legal precedent, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=280.64s)]
*  completely vulnerable to serious criminal sentencing here [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  is actually very helpful. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=288.18s)]
*  Rachel, what do you think about that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=289.68s)]
*  That we have two defendants here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=291.78s)]
*  And just the story told through this indictment [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  of this individual essentially being recruited [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=297.62s)]
*  into a criminal conspiracy, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  not the only one, Donald Trump tries to recruit [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  into a criminal conspiracy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=306.5s)]
*  He basically attempts to do the same with his lawyer [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  who is deaf enough to extricate himself. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=309.24s)]
*  We'll get to that in a moment. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  But the fact that that's part of the story [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=312.7s)]
*  is part of this indictment as well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's a really astute point by Lawrence [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=315.96s)]
*  that you, you know, in every jury considering a case [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=318.73999999999995s)]
*  like this, you know, they're taught about precedent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  They're taught about light crimes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=324.4s)]
*  They're taught about, you know, the seriousness [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=325.4s)]
*  of the offense and all of those things [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  over the course of their participation in it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=328.0s)]
*  But when they're looking at somebody like Walt Nauta, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=329.78s)]
*  who isn't going to have, you know, the world rising up [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  and saying that it's the death of the Republic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=335.12s)]
*  if he's convicted of something, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=336.96s)]
*  if he's plainly guilty of something [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  that's gonna make it harder to say [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=340.02s)]
*  that Mr. Nauta ought to be convicted [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=341.88s)]
*  and Mr. Trump shouldn't because of something else [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  mystical about him that makes him a different kind of citizen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=345.44s)]
*  I think that's a really astute point by Lawrence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=348.68s)]
*  I will also just say, you know, I know in our earlier coverage [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=350.78s)]
*  there was some discussion as to whether or not Mr. Nauta [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=353.78s)]
*  might feel like he wanted to plead guilty, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=355.96s)]
*  like he might want to cooperate, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=359.38s)]
*  like he might want to not be on the, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=361.06s)]
*  at the sharp end of this stick any longer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  I think it's, it may be heretical for me to say it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=365.9s)]
*  and everybody can shout me down, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=368.74s)]
*  but I think we should also talk about the possibility [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=369.84s)]
*  that Donald Trump might plead. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=371.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is looking at decades and decades [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  and decades in prison. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=376.76s)]
*  And this indictment is very straightforward [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=378.5s)]
*  and not complicated and doesn't leave a lot out. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=381.4s)]
*  And it tells you very much [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=383.64s)]
*  what they've got to use against him. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, if it were you, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  would you consider pleading guilty to this for, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=387.84s)]
*  in exchange for lenience? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=389.84s)]
*  I might. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=391.73999999999995s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=392.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  And we're not really contending with that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMLJczpAuI&t=394.23999999999995s)]
