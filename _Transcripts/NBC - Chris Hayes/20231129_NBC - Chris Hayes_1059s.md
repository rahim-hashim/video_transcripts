# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Just weeks from now, voters will cast the first ballots in, believe it or not, the 2024 primary presidential elections. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=0.0s)]
*  In less than a year, the whole country will vote again, not only on who will be the next president of these United States, but most likely on whether to continue the American Democratic experiment, at least in its current form. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=10.0s)]
*  This coming year will also bring at least one trial of the Republican frontrunner and former President Donald Trump, the most important of the 91 felony charges against him, the federal elections case, which is now set to go before a judge in March. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=25.0s)]
*  That case serves as a crucial reminder of just how serious the man was about overturning American democracy on January 6, how close he came to succeeding, and how much he wants to do it again. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=38.0s)]
*  And today, we've got new information about the attempted coup. Now, on its own, this detail, which I'm about to relay to you, might seem smaller and significant, but it actually sheds dramatic light on one of the most enduring mysteries from January 6 and the run-up to it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=50.0s)]
*  But more importantly, it suggests how prepared the entirety of the Republican Party might have been to go along with Trump's plot if things went in that direction. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=65.0s)]
*  Now, as part of the investigation into the attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Special Counsel Jack Smith has been speaking with key players as they prepare their case in court, and that includes former Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=77.0s)]
*  Pence, of course, famously eschewing, talking to the January 6 committee. He's been talking to Smith. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=89.0s)]
*  And according to a new ABC News report, Smith's team has pressed Pence on all sorts of questions, even something so granular as the placement of a comma in his book. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=95.0s)]
*  When recounting a phone call with Trump on Christmas Day 2020, Pence wrote in his book that he told Trump, and I quote, you know, I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome of the election on January 6. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=104.0s)]
*  But Pence allegedly told Smith's investigators that comma should have never been placed there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=116.0s)]
*  He actually meant to write that he admonished Trump. You know I don't have the authority to change the outcome. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=122.0s)]
*  Suggesting Trump was well aware of the limitations of Pence's authority. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=129.0s)]
*  The special counsel's investigators also pressed Pence on personal notes he took after meetings with Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=134.0s)]
*  One of those notes written several days before Pence was due to preside over the certification of the electoral votes in Congress on January 6 reveals that Pence momentarily decided that he would skip the proceedings on January 6 where he was going to preside altogether. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=140.0s)]
*  These are notes after meetings with Trump, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=156.0s)]
*  The then vice president wrote, quote, not feeling like I should attend electoral count. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=159.0s)]
*  Too many questions, too many doubts, too hurtful to my friend. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=165.0s)]
*  Therefore, I'm not going to participate in certification of election. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=169.0s)]
*  Now, Mike Pence, I think is smart enough to know that Donald Trump is not his friend. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=174.0s)]
*  And again, to his credit, he did, of course, decide in the end to show up and fulfill his constitutional obligation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=179.0s)]
*  But those notes indicate there was at least a moment when he was planning to not show up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=186.0s)]
*  The reason this is such an arresting detail there in black and white, apparently, reportedly in the notes from Pence himself that the investigators saw. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=193.0s)]
*  The reason it's such an arresting detail is because it connects to an unexplained mystery of what the man underneath him in the chain of command, the president pro tempore, knew ahead of January 6. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=201.0s)]
*  OK, at the time, Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, that man you see there, was the second highest ranking official in the Senate after Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=213.0s)]
*  He was next in line to preside over that crucial gathering on January 6 for the certification of electoral votes if Pence was not there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=223.0s)]
*  And the day before, seemingly kind of out of nowhere on January 5th, Senator Grassley told reporters that that is exactly what was going to happen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=233.0s)]
*  I quote him here. If the vice president isn't there and we don't expect him to be there, I will be presiding over the Senate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=244.0s)]
*  I remember when he said that on January 5th. A lot of people were surprised. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=250.0s)]
*  It raised a lot of red flags. I mean, there were already concerns swirling about members of Congress objecting to electoral vote in both houses. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=255.0s)]
*  There was a bunch of House members and senators. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=262.0s)]
*  And then what Mike Pence would do with those objections and whether he would help execute the coup or stand against it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=265.0s)]
*  When Chuck Grassley said that to reporters on January 5th, it made it sound like Mike Pence decided that he would not participate at all, that he would not stand in the way of the coup going forward. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=273.0s)]
*  He would step aside and let Chuck Grassley, an ardent defender of Trump, play that role. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=284.0s)]
*  Obviously, that was an alarming and damning proposition. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=292.0s)]
*  Now, Grassley's team quickly walked out back calling it a misinterpretation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=296.0s)]
*  They said they were talking about some other portion of the proceedings and saying the vice president Pence was expected to preside the next day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=300.0s)]
*  So, again, a weird little footnote in this entire drama. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=307.0s)]
*  Grassley's initial statement just left hanging there tantalizing question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=312.0s)]
*  Did he misspeak, like they said? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=317.0s)]
*  Or was there some plan in place behind the scenes in which Pence decided at some point that he was going to sidestep his duty and let someone else preside over January 6th, presumably someone who would go along with the coup? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=319.0s)]
*  And did someone inform Chuck Grassley about Mike Pence making such a decision that he was not going to be there? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=334.0s)]
*  And for nearly three years, we've had no concrete evidence supporting that damning possibility. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=341.0s)]
*  But now we do for Mike Pence himself. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=346.0s)]
*  I mean, his own contemporaneous notes obtained by special counsel Jack Smith and his testimony Smith's team prove Pence had decided to leave the certification of the votes in Grassley's hands on January 6th. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=348.0s)]
*  And those notes are evidence suggesting that Grassley may very well not have been mistaken. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=359.0s)]
*  Instead, he was telling the honest truth about what he knew that he had been briefed or told about this decision. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=365.0s)]
*  Again, we still don't know definitively. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=370.0s)]
*  There's no, like, actual smoking gun here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=373.0s)]
*  What we do now know definitively, and this is from the January 6th committee, is that Trump's own coup lawyers wrote out memos imagining a scenario in which Grassley presided. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=375.0s)]
*  We know that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=386.0s)]
*  We know that Pence himself came to a decision, apparently after meeting with Trump, that he would recuse himself and allow Grassley to do it and memorialize that in notes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=387.0s)]
*  And we have Grassley telling reporters that Pence wasn't going to be there and he was planning on presiding. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=396.0s)]
*  Grassley still denies he had any idea whatsoever any of the machinations. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=402.0s)]
*  And yes, this is about a detail about something that happened or nearly happened nearly three years ago. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=407.0s)]
*  It didn't end up happening. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=415.0s)]
*  But it's so relevant and important in this moment as we look ahead again. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=417.0s)]
*  Focus here as we come down the barrel this year. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=422.0s)]
*  Because it reveals a key lesson from the Trump era. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=427.0s)]
*  Chuck Grassley is part of the establishment. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=431.0s)]
*  He's not one of the colorful pro-coup characters like Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell or the overstock guy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=434.0s)]
*  He did not vote to overturn the election on that fateful day when after the violent mob sicked the Capitol, they all came back into the chamber and had to vote about whether they're going to go along with the mob. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=441.0s)]
*  He didn't vote for it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=451.0s)]
*  In the end, though, Chuck Grassley and the rest of the establishment will go along with just about anything if they see the wind is blowing that way. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=452.0s)]
*  I mean, no one has stated that more clearly than Grassley himself. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=462.0s)]
*  Saying it straight up, accepting, explaining why he accepted Donald Trump's endorsement in October of 2021 after the coup. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=468.0s)]
*  I was born at night, but not last night. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=478.0s)]
*  So if I didn't accept the endorsement of a person that's got 91 percent of the Republican voters in Iowa, I wouldn't be too smart. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=482.0s)]
*  I'm smart enough to accept that endorsement. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=494.0s)]
*  Truly one of the most almost comically honest statements I've heard from a politician. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=497.0s)]
*  Like, he doesn't say like, I like the guy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=502.0s)]
*  I think the guy is good. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=505.0s)]
*  I think that the guy's coup attempt. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=507.0s)]
*  Good, bad, whatever. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=509.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=511.0s)]
*  Politically, I will accept his endorsement. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=512.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=514.0s)]
*  That's the logic. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=515.0s)]
*  We've seen Republicans do this over and over again. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=516.0s)]
*  After he sicked the mob in the Capitol, they've remained in line. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=518.0s)]
*  That same Chuck Grassley logic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=521.0s)]
*  Three weeks after January 6, Kevin McCarthy went to visit Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, smiling and shaking hands. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=523.0s)]
*  Remember that infamous photo in her new book, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney reveals. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=530.0s)]
*  McCarthy tried to explain that away, claiming that Trump's staff was, quote, really worried about the former president. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=535.0s)]
*  And I quote here again, Trump's not eating. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=542.0s)]
*  So they asked me to come see him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=545.0s)]
*  He's really depressed. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=547.0s)]
*  The reality, as we have learned, is that Kevin McCarthy and Chuck Grassley and basically the entire rest of them, with the exception of a few, may Mitt Romney. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=552.0s)]
*  They're just going to follow Donald Trump to the ends of the earth or the ends of American democracy if it helps their chances for power. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=561.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=569.0s)]
*  They're not saving us. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=571.0s)]
*  They're not the guardrail. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=572.0s)]
*  They weren't going to stand in his way last time, I don't think. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=574.0s)]
*  They're not going to stand his way the next time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=577.0s)]
*  Keep that in mind because it's the most destructive and dangerous legacy of Donald Trump and his coup. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=579.0s)]
*  It's why the stakes of this next year are so very high. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=587.0s)]
*  Every year since Hisham Ortani enrolled at Brown University, he's spent Thanksgiving at his grandmother's house in Burlington, Vermont, just a few hours away. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=592.0s)]
*  His uncle lives next door, and it's a place that Hisham, you see here with his parents, has visited since he was a little boy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=601.0s)]
*  This year, the 20-year-old was joined by two lifelong friends. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=609.0s)]
*  One of them is Kinan Abdelhamid, who's a student at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=613.0s)]
*  You see him there. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=618.0s)]
*  He runs track. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=619.0s)]
*  Here he is on the right with Hisham when the two boys were at a Model United Nations event at their American friend's school, Quaker School in Ramallah in the West Bank. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=620.0s)]
*  The other friend is Tassin Ali Ahmed, a student at Trinity College in Connecticut, all three of Palestinian descent. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=628.0s)]
*  On Saturday, they went bowling for a birthday party for Hisham's twin cousins who turned eight. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=636.0s)]
*  Afterwards, they went for a walk around the neighborhood, just a quintessentially American scene in the best sense. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=640.0s)]
*  These young men with astoundingly bright futures and global roots spending a Thanksgiving holiday break in New England away from their demanding schoolwork, laughing with friends and family. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=645.0s)]
*  And then it turned into a quintessentially American scene in the worst sense. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=655.0s)]
*  They had gone just a few blocks when a white man in a hoodie approached them. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=659.0s)]
*  They moved to get out of his way, but the man pulled a pistol and started firing without saying a word. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=663.0s)]
*  Anan was shot in the glute area and was released from the hospital today. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=668.0s)]
*  Tassin was shot in the chest. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=672.0s)]
*  Hisham was shot through his clavicle and the bullet lodge in his spine. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=674.0s)]
*  According to his mother, he may not be able to walk again and has a long recovery. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=678.0s)]
*  Now, we don't know much about the intent of the shooter. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=682.0s)]
*  We do know that the time when the three friends were shot, the two were wearing traditional Palestinian scars, kafias, and they were speaking a combination of Arabic and English. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=685.0s)]
*  A suspect, a 40-year-old white male, has been arrested and charged with three counts of attempted murder. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=694.0s)]
*  And local police and the FBI are investigating the possibility it was a hate crime. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=699.0s)]
*  Rich Price is Hisham Murtani's uncle, who he was visiting with in Burlington, and he joins me now. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=703.0s)]
*  Rich, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=710.0s)]
*  I wonder if first you could just give us an update on how your nephew is doing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=712.0s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me and for a chance to talk about my nephew. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=718.0s)]
*  He's demonstrating incredible resilience and strength, even sense of humor in the face of a really difficult time. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=723.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, he did sustain a devastating injury and his road to recovery is really long. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=734.0s)]
*  And as we've been talking about it, there's sort of a couple facets of his recovery. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=742.0s)]
*  One is, of course, medical and rehabilitation. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=747.0s)]
*  The other is spirit and resilience. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=751.0s)]
*  And in that department, we're confident Hisham's going to knock it out of the park. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to read a little bit of the statement because he can't speak for himself that he released and that was read at a vigil at Brown University where he's a student. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=761.0s)]
*  It's a long statement and very moving. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=770.0s)]
*  But one of the things he says that's important to recognize as part of a larger story that this hideous crime did not happen in a vacuum. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=773.0s)]
*  As much as I appreciate and love every single one of you here today, I am but one casualty in this much wider conflict. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=780.0s)]
*  Can you tell me about Hisham and his time at Brown? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=787.0s)]
*  I've been so sort of taken with the image of these three young men and the fact that they go to school in the West Bank and then they're in New England at these very, you know, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=790.0s)]
*  fancy old American schools and living sort of these lives sort of across straddling this this wide divide. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll just say all three of them are incredible young men. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=806.0s)]
*  As you said, they were guests around our Thanksgiving table as they have in the past. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=811.0s)]
*  And my wife and I have five sons and we went to bed the night of Thanksgiving and actually said to one another how lucky and grateful we were to have these three young men. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=816.0s)]
*  Set an example for our sons, you know, in terms of their intellectual curiosity, their their respectfulness, their their kindness towards my sons all weekend long. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=828.0s)]
*  They were doing, you know, they were playing board games with my sons. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=842.0s)]
*  They were playing ping pong with my boys. They were playing FIFA on the on the video games. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=846.0s)]
*  As you said, they came to my eight year old twins birthday party. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=853.0s)]
*  What college juniors want to do that on their Thanksgiving break? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=857.0s)]
*  But they did. And they were playing with our sons and we got home from that party. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=861.0s)]
*  And as you said, they decided to take a walk to get some fresh air and. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=867.0s)]
*  I don't know where this hateful individual stepped out of the dark and and and open fire. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=872.0s)]
*  I had read that his father, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, is in the West Bank, right? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=882.0s)]
*  Had had had not wanted him to come home for break, thinking that obviously the situation there is very unstable. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=888.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's just something so horrifically ironic about that, obviously. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=897.0s)]
*  I'm not saying something novel here, but just that that he stayed in the, you know, the quiet and calm precincts of Burlington, Vermont. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=902.0s)]
*  And this happened. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=912.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, my sister, you see her here with her, you know, her family, her family, her friends, her family. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=915.0s)]
*  You know, my sister, you see her here with my nephew has lived in the West Bank for the last couple of decades. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=923.0s)]
*  And I'm asked all the time, don't you worry about your sister? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=932.0s)]
*  Don't you worry about your nephews and your niece living in under occupation in the West Bank? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=935.0s)]
*  And of course I do. And it's it's tragically ironic that they would come spend. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=942.0s)]
*  That he would come and his friends would come spend Thanksgiving in Burlington, Vermont, of all places. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=953.0s)]
*  And this would happen to them. And it's I feel a great sense of shame and sadness. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=959.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, Burlington, as you know, Chris, is is a place that prides itself for being welcoming, diverse, inclusive. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=964.0s)]
*  And so it's unfathomable for us. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=977.0s)]
*  And I will say that the community here has really rallied behind us. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=982.0s)]
*  We're feeling incredible, incredible sense of support from people here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=988.0s)]
*  And and we're really grateful, grateful for that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=992.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I got to say, covering this conflict, you know, one of the struggles I think is sort of relating to different parts of the conflict. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=996.0s)]
*  And and and it's just human nature that certain things will grab you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1004.0s)]
*  And as an alumni of Brown and it is I've been very invested in your nephew and his friends story just for that silly reason that belated ability. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1009.0s)]
*  But we're just hoping the absolute best for him, Rich. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1018.0s)]
*  And I hope you can keep us up to date about him and his recovery. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1022.0s)]
*  And I really do hope I get to meet him at some point. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1025.0s)]
*  Thank you. I'll just say very quickly that Brown has been incredibly supportive. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1029.0s)]
*  They've said, hey, whatever the problems will take care of us. So that's great. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN9LQtbJfaI&t=1033.0s)]
