# Ex-FTC chair Lina Khan on the anti-monopoly ‘hunger’ in America
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ)
*  From the very start of the Trump presidency, as he was sworn in with all the big tech bosses [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  sitting in the front row, it's been absolutely crystal clear why business people have supported [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=8.52s)]
*  They will choose deregulation over everything. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=9.94s)]
*  Over democracy, over fairness, over being able to attract workers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=13.44s)]
*  Business will choose deregulation over everything. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=17.78s)]
*  People have been asking me, will the business community stand up to Trump? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=20.44s)]
*  Zero chance. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=23.48s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  They got the deal they wanted, and so did Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  As the Wall Street Journal reports yesterday, Trump spent the months before taking office [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=28.42s)]
*  hosting lavish dinners for health care executives, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=32.02s)]
*  from them in return for influence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=36.1s)]
*  And remember back in May when Trump asked oil executives at Mar-a-Lago for a billion [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=38.22s)]
*  dollar donation while promising to slash policies on electric vehicles and wind energy? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=43.2s)]
*  Trump's approach to business leaders totally ignores the responsibility of the U.S. government [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=48.58s)]
*  to regulate business and protect consumers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=52.58s)]
*  And we're witnessing in real time now the corrosive effect of unchecked corporate power [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=55.26s)]
*  and wealth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=61.22s)]
*  There are laws in place, most effectively antitrust laws, that are meant to be a check [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=62.78s)]
*  on the consolidation of wealth and power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=68.1s)]
*  Those laws were wielded to great effect by the Federal Trade Commission in three and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=71.22s)]
*  a half years that Lena Cahn chaired the agency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  She sued Amazon for being a monopoly, and investigated Microsoft for abusing its market [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=77.58s)]
*  power. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=82.1s)]
*  She stopped the merger of grocery giants Kroger's and Albertsons. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=83.1s)]
*  She stopped mergers at NVIDIA, Lockheed Martin, and HCA Healthcare. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=85.66s)]
*  She took action against companies like Grubhub and Lyft for misleading workers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=89.78s)]
*  She sued pharmacy benefit managers for artificially inflating the price of insulin. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=93.46s)]
*  The aggressive antitrust position made Lena Cahn very unpopular on Wall Street. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  But it was some of the most robust consumer protection from the FTC in decades. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=104.66s)]
*  And Lena Cahn, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission joins me now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=110.02s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=113.56s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=114.56s)]
*  I just want to underscore this point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=115.56s)]
*  In many cases, the things you were doing were laws that were on the books meant to protect [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=116.92s)]
*  Americans that were simply not enforced in previous administrations in some cases. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  The antitrust laws go all the way back to 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act, and then [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  we had the Clayton Act and the FTC Act in 1914. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=132.46s)]
*  These laws were really about wanting to make sure that we had an economy that was competitive, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  that was fair, where people could get a fair shake, but ultimately also about wanting to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=142.5s)]
*  make sure that our democracy was being protected from unchecked concentrations of economic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=146.78s)]
*  power and fundamentally from oligarchy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=152.22s)]
*  And so these are laws that have been around for decades. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Starting in the Reagan administration, there was a real pivot, a pretty radical shift away [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=159.14s)]
*  from enforcing the laws faithfully. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=164.34s)]
*  And so we saw decades of unchecked consolidation, monopolization that has really harmed Americans, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  has made them poorer, has allowed companies to charge people more while paying them less, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=174.22s)]
*  squeezing out small businesses, reducing innovation and really hollowing out communities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=179.94s)]
*  And so it was a great honor to get to chair the Federal Trade Commission and really be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=186.34s)]
*  focused on reinvigorating all of the tools that Congress gave us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=190.02s)]
*  Let's talk about competition. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=193.78s)]
*  When businesses are able to get too big, it squeezes out the ability of new people to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=195.38s)]
*  enter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  So Silicon Valley is a great example of that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  A lot of these massive companies were started, they were little startups, started in people's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=204.5s)]
*  garages and things like that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=207.66s)]
*  But in fact, the unchecked power of Silicon Valley wealth means it's much harder for that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  to replicate itself. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=213.17999999999998s)]
*  Little small competitors can't compete against the big players. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=214.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=219.22s)]
*  We had the chance to go out to Silicon Valley several times, met with founders and startups [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=220.26s)]
*  that want to be the next great big company, but all too often found that existing monopolization [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=225.26s)]
*  and the existing gatekeepers were making it extraordinarily difficult for them to fairly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=231.34s)]
*  compete. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=236.26s)]
*  And what that means is that if you have startups that are taking that risk and have the talent [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=237.26s)]
*  to introduce the next great idea, unless our markets are open and fair, they're never going [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=242.3s)]
*  to be able to succeed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=247.94s)]
*  And that's really just deeply antithetical to what has made America's economy so strong. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=249.42s)]
*  So no one's going to have trouble understanding the fact that if they're monopolies, you probably [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=253.98s)]
*  pay more for a service. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=258.3s)]
*  What I think is a little more abstract is how is the concentration of wealth, how does [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=260.7s)]
*  it undermine democracy? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=265.58s)]
*  Clearly we're watching some of that happen right now, but how do you articulate that? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=266.9s)]
*  What's the danger of having too much concentration of wealth as it relates to a healthy democracy? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=270.18s)]
*  So the founders and those who really were formative in passing the original antitrust [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=276.14000000000004s)]
*  laws were really concerned that if you allow unchecked concentrations of economic power, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=281.98s)]
*  that that undermines people's liberties in a really fundamental way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  And if what we care about in America is wanting to make sure people have freedom, that we're [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=293.06s)]
*  protecting them from the arbitrary exercise of power, that means we need to have checks [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  and balances in our sphere of government, but it also means that we need checks and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=303.54s)]
*  balances in our commercial sphere. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=307.9s)]
*  Because if you have a democracy in name but are allowing people to be bullied and coerced [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=310.26s)]
*  and pushed around by monopolists, that really is going to undermine how people experience [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=315.98s)]
*  freedom in their day-to-day lives. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=321.5s)]
*  There was a great quote where Senator Sherman said, you know, if we overthrew a monarch, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=323.72s)]
*  we didn't do that just to be ruled by autocrats of trade. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=329.74s)]
*  And so there was a real idea that protecting real liberty and democracy meant needing rules [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=333.38s)]
*  not just in our sphere of government, but also in how we structure the economy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=338.9s)]
*  Obviously, under the Biden administration, the FEC was very aggressive under your leadership. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=342.94s)]
*  But it's not actually a completely partisan thing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=347.84s)]
*  You had some allies, some Republican allies. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=350.74s)]
*  There are still a number of Republicans who think that America is better if businesses [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=353.34s)]
*  do face some degree of regulation. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=358.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  I've been really struck by the degree to which people on both sides of the aisle are [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  extremely skeptical of monopolies of unchecked corporate power. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=368.14s)]
*  I had the chance in my job at the FTC to travel across the country, meet with farmers in Iowa [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=373.62s)]
*  or pharmacists in Kansas City or gig drivers from Minneapolis. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  And all of them were really struggling with the ways that corporations, when they're not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=385.26s)]
*  checked by the rules, can abuse their power and really harm people fundamentally. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  I would get letters from people saying, I'm a lifelong Republican, but the FTC's rule [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=395.1s)]
*  to eliminate non-compete clauses is the best thing the government has done in my life. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=400.74s)]
*  And so I think there is a real organic hunger from people who want to see their government [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  fighting back against corporate law breaking. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=411.86s)]
*  And that's what we did at the FTC. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=414.5s)]
*  Where are we now? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  Because in all the noise about what's going on in Washington and Doge, in fact, some of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=417.62s)]
*  the rules and some of the determinations you made as chair of FTC are still in place. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=422.5s)]
*  It hasn't been dismantled. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  I don't know whether to end that with a yet or not. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=430.38s)]
*  Where do you think we're going? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, look, it's too early to know. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  And of course, it's been extraordinarily alarming to see the dismantling of agencies like the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  CFPB, which have been such critical partners to the FTC. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=441.66s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=445.1s)]
*  I mean, look, there were lawsuits against big tech that were started in the first Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=446.58s)]
*  administration. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=451.06s)]
*  And then in the Biden administration, we kind of picked up that baton and kept going. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=452.41999999999996s)]
*  And so I think you're definitely going to see some areas where now that we're back in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=456.62s)]
*  the Trump administration, we're going to see some of that activity continue as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=460.62s)]
*  But I do get the sense that there is a real factional debate between the more populist [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=464.34s)]
*  wing and the more oligarchic wing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=470.18s)]
*  And we're going to have to see how things shake out. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=472.5s)]
*  This becomes very important right now, because in fact, if you look at things like the Edelman [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=475.18s)]
*  Trust Barometer, Americans actually trust businesses more than they trust government [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=479.38s)]
*  or media. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=483.86s)]
*  But I don't believe that businesses are going to come to our rescue in this particular instance. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=486.38s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=491.62s)]
*  Maybe I'm being a little, I'm exaggerating. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVjvgBYmiLQ&t=492.62s)]
