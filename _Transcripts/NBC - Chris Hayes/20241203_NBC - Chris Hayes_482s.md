# ‘Reverse Jan. 6’: South Koreans help lawmakers scale parliament to save democracy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. As we here in America struggle to uphold our own democratic institutions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=0.0s)]
*  There is a situation playing out in South Korea right now that is remarkably relevant [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=6.18s)]
*  Disturbing and and maybe at this hour quite hopeful [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Remarkable scene you may have seen throughout the day unfolding over the last 24 hours where citizens of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=16.38s)]
*  South Korea have taken to the streets to defend [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=22.42s)]
*  Democracy against an erratic far-right president who declared martial law [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=25.720000000000002s)]
*  That president would be Yoon Seok-yoo [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=30.96s)]
*  it's a story that might sound in some ways familiar to you a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=33.4s)]
*  Political novice who ran for president in 2022 thanks to high inflation and frustration with the liberal predecessor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=37.64s)]
*  Yoon narrowly won that election by just about a quarter of a percent of all votes cast [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=44.08s)]
*  He identified as an anti-feminist made a point of courting the South Korean [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  Male vote the sort of manosphere that exists over there with an openly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  misogynistic campaign that blamed feminism for the country's low birthrates as [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=58.72s)]
*  President he tried to dismantle the government's gender equity agency [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=63.24s)]
*  He also tried to raise the country's maximum weekly working hours from 52 to 69 a week [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=67.7s)]
*  Which you can imagine was deeply unpopular. It's funny how right-wing populists always sort of get around to that kind of stuff, huh? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  He also tried to push through reforms the country's medical system that led to months of mass strikes by doctors and nurses and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=80.1s)]
*  You'll never guess he and his family got embroiled in a bunch of scandals including allegations of accepting improper gifts [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=86.7s)]
*  also kind of through line [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=93.3s)]
*  Now the upshot was that in parliamentary elections this spring the highest turnout for a South Korean election since the 20th century [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=95.1s)]
*  The opposition party won on a landslide and that left you this party holding just a third of the country's National Assembly [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=102.34s)]
*  Amid all that you and his approval rating fell to an abysmal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=108.86s)]
*  17% earlier this month [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  He and many of his government allies faced impeachment efforts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  He was talked about as a lame duck president, which made his declaration yesterday all the more shocking [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=117.38s)]
*  even made a speech to the nation overnight full of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  Sort of Trumpian inflection saying quote [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=126.58s)]
*  I declare emergency martial law to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=129.06s)]
*  pro-north Korean [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  Anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people and to protect the free constitutional order [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  Through this emergency martial law. I will rebuild and defend the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into ruin [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=146.38s)]
*  To this end I will surely eradicate the criminals of the anti-state forces who have been committing atrocity so far [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  the army general Yoon put in charge then issued the declaration of martial law and if you're wondering what that looks like in the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  Democratic country of South Korea quote all political activities including the operations of the National Assembly local councils [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=167.54s)]
*  Political parties political associations assemblies and demonstrations are strictly prohibited [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  All media and publications will be subject to the control of the martial law command strikes work slowdowns and gatherings that incite social [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=179.46s)]
*  Disorder are forbidden all medical professionals including resident doctors currently on strike or absent from medical duties must return to their work and perform their [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=187.9s)]
*  responsibilities within 48 hours [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=196.34s)]
*  Violators will be dealt with under martial law. I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=198.82s)]
*  Mean just straight-up [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=201.82s)]
*  Dictatorship right a dictatorial power grab like we ban all politics henceforth [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=204.06s)]
*  Nothing in civil society can happen right single-handedly revoking freedom of speech and freedom of assembly freedom of movement the freedom to strike [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=210.02s)]
*  And all this happening in a country where memories of authority and authoritarian rule are fresh [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=218.5s)]
*  This is a democratic country because its people fought for that democracy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  after a series of authoritarian regimes in the post World War two era post Korean War era a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  military coup swept South Korea in 1980 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  South Korea is under full martial law after a week of student violence and what the official announcement called North Korean [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=238.94s)]
*  movements minutes after the announcement the martial law command closed the school's banned political activity and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=245.74s)]
*  Arrested several well-known dissidents including the head of South Korea's major political party [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=252.1s)]
*  You see the through line there, right? Of course the North Korean menace a sort of threat of communist infiltration and fifth columnists [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=257.5s)]
*  And in 1980 the coup plotters smashed protesters established a one-party state that lasted until free elections in 1987 [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=264.66s)]
*  Brought down through street protests basically and after you use martial law announcement last night [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=271.7s)]
*  Well South Koreans on a dime in the middle of the night decided they were not going back [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=277.06s)]
*  People immediately took to the streets in the freezing cold of night in their parkas all ages [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=282.9s)]
*  And they did not just protest for the sake of protesting. They had a very specific goal in mind [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=288.26s)]
*  You see the country's legislature could block Yoon's martial law decree with a simple majority vote, but aha [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=292.58s)]
*  Yoon's declaration banned political activities and he sent soldiers to the National Assembly building basically their capital, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=299.46s)]
*  To enforce the ban and to block lawmakers from getting inside the building for a quorum where they could have a vote and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  so, what do you get you get visuals like this as [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=313.94s)]
*  civilian protesters teamed up with those lawmakers who rushed to the Capitol to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=317.22s)]
*  Help them scale the Capitol building and get inside to cast their votes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=322.3s)]
*  It was as one commenter on social media put it a reverse January 6th, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  Breaking into the Capitol to vote to save democracy working together to get the National Assembly to vote [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=334.02s)]
*  to overrule martial law and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=340.46s)]
*  it worked [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=343.46s)]
*  Within three hours of Yoon's speech a quorum of lawmakers [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=344.98s)]
*  I believe 190 of them got into the building they forced to vote to reject his martial law declaration a unanimous vote as [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=348.02s)]
*  The AP noted all 190 lawmakers participating the vote supported the lifting of martial law [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=355.18s)]
*  Immediately after that vote television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at Parliament leaving the site [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=361.74s)]
*  In six hours after he declared martial law as the Sun rose over Seoul president Yoon Seok-yo backed down [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=367.74s)]
*  My bad, maybe not [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=375.1s)]
*  He lifted his order [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  Protesters are celebrating many are calling for you to resign or be impeached [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=380.3s)]
*  In fact, the opposition party is drawing up impeachment articles. We understand this moment [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=384.3s)]
*  Now I've been transfixed by these developments all day long, I don't know if you have as well I mean [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=388.38s)]
*  Incredible stuff exciting inspiring energizing to watch [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  Everyday Koreans. I mean all ages [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=400.3s)]
*  People I think from what I could tell from the reporting whose politics were really kind of all over the place [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=403.74s)]
*  Come out to stand up for democracy grandmas in their parkas in freezing temperatures [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=409.54s)]
*  Standing up to armed soldiers in their faces literally pushing their lawmakers to pass a law saving their democratic institutions [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  And all to resist this far-right misogynist president who won by the skin of his teeth and decided he had a mandate to make over the country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=421.3s)]
*  in his image [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=427.90000000000003s)]
*  Even as he frittered away all his political capital and grew historically unpopular [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=429.74s)]
*  It's a different country different constitution different traditions [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  I think there's a lesson there for us right Americans in 2024 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=441.06s)]
*  Crucially a reminder that in the end the last bulwark of democracy [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=447.06s)]
*  the people themselves [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=452.26s)]
*  Working with and through an elected opposition unafraid to do the right thing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  You [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9gRDrCxbo&t=470.34s)]
