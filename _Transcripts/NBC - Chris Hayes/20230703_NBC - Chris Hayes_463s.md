# In wake of deadly mass shooting in Baltimore, mayor decries ghost guns, trafficking
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM)
*  In one sense, this is a crime scene. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=0.0s)]
*  Just after 1230 a.m. on Sunday, gunfire erupted at a neighborhood in South Baltimore, Maryland, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=3.04s)]
*  called Brooklyn. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=8.44s)]
*  Thirty people were shot. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=9.44s)]
*  Many of them were critically injured. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=11.24s)]
*  Two of them died, including a young woman who had recently graduated and was on her [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=12.88s)]
*  way to college. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  In another sense, this is the scene of a public health crisis and a failure of political will [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  to do anything about the guns that are killing so many people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=23.44s)]
*  The mayor of Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott, is going to join us live in just a moment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=27.7s)]
*  But first, I want you to hear his words for his own city of Baltimore today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  This is not just a Baltimore thing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=38.18s)]
*  We have to be honest. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=40.22s)]
*  This is the United States of America. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=42.12s)]
*  This is our longest-standing public health challenge. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=44.66s)]
*  And we need to focus on gun violence, regardless of where it happens, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=48.14s)]
*  Whether it's in inner city Baltimore, whether it's in suburbia, whether it's in rural America, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=53.66s)]
*  we have to take this conversation beyond not just me, but all my brother and sister mayors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=58.44s)]
*  around the country who we have these conversations consistently. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=63.28s)]
*  It's like we take turns telling each other that we're here to support each other and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  we know that we're going through. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=70.86s)]
*  But you're talking about a country where it's easier for a 14-year-old kid to order pieces [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=72.3s)]
*  together to put a gun together and go out and use it in the committance of a crime [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=79.06s)]
*  than it is for me to get Claritin D from CVS. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=83.66s)]
*  That's what we should be talking about every day in this country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  You hear folks say, well, oh, the violence has happened in Democrat-led cities. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=89.38s)]
*  Well, the guns are coming from Republican-led states, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=93.18s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=96.08s)]
*  People are dying in Baltimore, in the United States, and that's what should matter and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=97.38s)]
*  that's what we should be acting on every day. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=101.66s)]
*  Joining us now is Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  Mayor, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=108.22s)]
*  We appreciate you making the time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=110.74s)]
*  What is the latest update you can share with us at this hour? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=113.38s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me, Simone. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=116.58s)]
*  What we're still doing, of course, right now, our detectives are working, going through [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=120.26s)]
*  all the hours of footage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=124.1s)]
*  We're going to look at every second of footage, not just from CCTV, from social media, going [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=125.7s)]
*  out talking to as many witnesses as possible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=130.86s)]
*  We have, in this case, so many young people, 15 of our victims were under the age of 18. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=135.1s)]
*  In Maryland, they cannot be talked to by police without their parent's permission or a lawyer [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=140.74s)]
*  present, so that elongates that process. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=145.86s)]
*  And we've also, again, put the full weight of my city government in Brooklyn. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=148.82s)]
*  I just came from a community meeting when we were talking about how we, as our neighborhood [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  stabilization response done from our mayor's office and neighborhood safety engagement, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=158.66s)]
*  we'll be there for 45 days. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  But what we can do, working with that community from here on out to make sure that we're wrapping [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=163.78s)]
*  our arms in every single resource that's coming to bear. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  I had the unfortunate tonight having to talk with Aliya's parents and Aliya's parents, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=171.34s)]
*  parents tonight, to talk to both parents who lost children, one who just graduated from [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=178.46s)]
*  high school and supported me starting college, another who his mom was crying literally right [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  in front of me as I tried to console her because her son used to tutor young people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=189.02s)]
*  in high school, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=194.3s)]
*  This is what we're talking about, dealing with this mass shooting that happened in our [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=195.82000000000002s)]
*  city that was an act carried out, and we know that this is going to be illegal guns when [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=200.06s)]
*  we get to the end of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=204.78s)]
*  More than 200 people are said to have attended the block party, Mayor. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=206.86s)]
*  How come you don't yet have a suspect identified? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, listen, because this is still fresh. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=216.54s)]
*  Again, when you have a lot of the victims themselves, we still have seven of them in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=219.22s)]
*  the hospital, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=223.98s)]
*  And we have to get permission to talk to those young people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=225.22s)]
*  That's a process that we're going to have to go through, going through that footage, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=228.5s)]
*  looking to see who was out there, who had weapons. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=232.14s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=234.7s)]
*  We are going to find these people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=236.7s)]
*  We're going to hold the people that pulled that gun, that trigger responsible, Simone, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=239.1s)]
*  but we're not going to stop there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=243.18s)]
*  We're going to look at where that gun came from, whether it was trafficked into Baltimore, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=244.8s)]
*  who sold it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=248.68s)]
*  We're going to look at manufacturers, at dealers, everyone that plays a part in what happened [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=249.68s)]
*  in this tragedy will be held accountable in every way possible. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Police think there were at least three guns involved in this mass shooting. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=259.7s)]
*  Do you yet know whether the guns were legal? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=265.56s)]
*  And I know that this has been a huge issue for you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=268.2s)]
*  Ghost guns, getting them out of circulation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=271.56s)]
*  That is what you were alluding to in your remarks in the press conference, where you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=274.36s)]
*  talked about a 14-year-old being able to order pieces to put a gun together. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=278.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think, Simone, we don't know yet. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=283.0s)]
*  We know that there are multiple weapons. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=287.68s)]
*  We're going to be going back through, working with our partners at ATF and making sure that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  we're seeing exactly how many weapons were used, whether they're used in the commitments [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=293.48s)]
*  of other crimes, which we always get those hits and see that these weapons are used in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=297.6s)]
*  crimes not just here in Baltimore, but we get guns that were used in crimes in other [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=303.16s)]
*  cities and other states that end up here as well. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  We do know that ghost guns are a big problem, not just here in Baltimore, but across this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=309.44s)]
*  country of Maryland itself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=314.16s)]
*  We banned ghost guns. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=316.2s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=317.2s)]
*  We banned ghost guns a few years ago, and ghost gun recoveries are down for us here [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=318.2s)]
*  in Baltimore this year. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=321.8s)]
*  But we still know that guns here tend to come from other states. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=322.96s)]
*  We recover more weapons, Simone, that come from other states every year than here in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Maryland because of Maryland's gun laws. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=332.52s)]
*  And we have to have that conversation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=334.84s)]
*  There should not be. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=337.44s)]
*  And you're talking to someone who's the grandson of a pig farmer from North Carolina. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=339.08s)]
*  I first learned how to shoot my granddaddy's shotgun when I was 10 years old. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=344.2s)]
*  If folks are owning guns the right way, that's their prerogative. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  That's their American right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=352.44s)]
*  But we're talking about 14, 15-year-olds, people that are prohibited from having guns, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  on a website, order pieces of a gun together and put it together. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=359.88s)]
*  And the company knowingly is doing that because they are knowingly going around gun laws, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=364.12s)]
*  and those weapons are being used in cities and towns and areas across this country every [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=369.8s)]
*  day. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=375.6s)]
*  Congress should ban them right now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=376.6s)]
*  That shouldn't even be a discussion with the amount of mass shootings that we had this [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=378.8s)]
*  year, let alone since the first one that everyone talked about in Columbine High School way [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=382.6s)]
*  back in 1999. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=387.24s)]
*  We need the Congress to get off their butts and get involved in this fight. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=389.04s)]
*  And it's not just ghost guns. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=394.0s)]
*  It's how guns are trafficking and illegal guns keep ending up in the hands of people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=395.92s)]
*  who are pulling triggers and killing people in malls, in churches, at block parties, on [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  streets each and every day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  This is America's longest-standing public health challenge, and we as a country have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  not dealt with this issue in its entirety in this time that we actually do it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=414.64s)]
*  Not Band-Aids. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=419.56s)]
*  We have a president who's done so much for this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=420.7s)]
*  We have congressional members who've been fighting for this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=423.36s)]
*  But we have so many members sitting in Congress who still weigh American guns over American [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=425.76s)]
*  lives, and that's despicable. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=432.12s)]
*  Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, on a very busy day for you, sir. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=439.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NE7DPi10wM&t=442.44s)]
