# ‘Absurd:’ GOP rep blasts Marjorie Taylor Greene over Biden impeachment push
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA)
*  MEHDI HASAN, The White House Press Conference, Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening from Washington. I'm Mehdi Hasan. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=2.0s)]
*  In for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Tomorrow, the House is back in session following a lengthy summer recess. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=4.08s)]
*  And Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces a new round of headaches, including a looming [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=8.48s)]
*  government shutdown and a renewed push from some of the most extreme members of his conference [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  to impeach President Joe Biden for something. They haven't quite figured that part out yet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  If you want to understand just how ridiculous and cynical this impeachment attempt is, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=24.88s)]
*  let me introduce you to Republican Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=28.96s)]
*  If you've been following American politics for a long time, you might remember that name. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Buck first became notorious during a race for Senate back in 2010, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=36.8s)]
*  when he made these comments about his primary opponent, Republican Lieutenant Governor [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Jay Norton. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=46.08s)]
*  I don't know if anybody has any questions. I'd love to answer some questions, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  but I'm not going to give my canned speech for the fourth turn today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=50.88s)]
*  Good. Yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Why should we vote for you? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=56.0s)]
*  Why should you vote for me? Because I do not wear high heels. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=57.68s)]
*  In other words, vote for me because I'm not a woman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=62.56s)]
*  Buck managed to lose that Senate race in a competitive seat, even amid the 2010 Tea Party [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=65.76s)]
*  wave that provided massive gains for his party. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=70.88s)]
*  But he got himself elected to a House seat four years later, where he made a name for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=73.84s)]
*  himself as one of the most conservative members of his party. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=77.2s)]
*  Buck is a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus. He said he opposes abortion, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=80.24s)]
*  even in cases of rape or incest. He said of Covid safety mitigations, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=84.32s)]
*  quote, we went like lambs to the slaughter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=88.0s)]
*  And he was one of a handful of votes against the first round of emergency Covid funding [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  under Trump at the very start of the pandemic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=94.96s)]
*  So Buck is hardly a liberal, though he's not always in lockstep with the extremists [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  in his own party either. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=102.63999999999999s)]
*  And here is what Ken Buck had to say about the push by some of his Republican colleagues, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=104.16s)]
*  including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to impeach President Biden. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=108.8s)]
*  The time for impeachment is the time when there's evidence linking President Biden, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  if there's evidence, linking President Biden to a high crime or misdemeanor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  That doesn't exist right now. And it isn't really something that we can say, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  well, in February we're going to do this. It's based on the facts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=128.48s)]
*  You go where the facts take you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=132.32s)]
*  Even the no high heels guy thinks impeaching Biden is the wrong move. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=135.84s)]
*  And over on the Senate side, there is not much enthusiasm either. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=141.04s)]
*  Republican Senators Shelley Moor Capito, Mitt Romney, Jerry Moran, Mike Rounds, Mitch McConnell [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=144.48s)]
*  and even the extremely maga Tommy Tuberville have all thrown water on the idea of impeaching Biden [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  before the 2024 election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=155.6s)]
*  Privately, they may even agree with their Democratic colleague, Senator John Fetterman, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=157.76s)]
*  who had a particularly, shall we say, colorful metaphor for the losing politics of impeachment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=161.84s)]
*  You know, if you can find the votes, go ahead, you're going to lose. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=171.04s)]
*  It would just be like a big circle jerk on the fringe, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=177.92s)]
*  Sometimes you just got to go call their bulls**t. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=183.28s)]
*  If they're going to throw it, then that's it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=187.28s)]
*  Nevertheless, Speaker McCarthy is still controlled by maga extremists in his party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  And so it looks like he is pushing ahead with impeachment anyway. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=195.68s)]
*  His top adviser, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is demanding it, going so far as to split with her [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=199.04s)]
*  former maga ally, Lauren Boebert, over who wants to impeach Biden more. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=203.28s)]
*  Recently, Greene tried to downplay how extreme impeaching President Biden would be, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=208.32s)]
*  saying, quote, It's just an inquiry. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=212.88s)]
*  It's like, may we ask the question? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=215.04s)]
*  Let's take a little peek, just a little peeky peek. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=217.12s)]
*  Peaky peek. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=221.12s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember how Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=222.48s)]
*  characterized the last impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=224.64s)]
*  As we go through watching this scam impeachment trial where you know what really is on trial, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=229.2s)]
*  everyone, it's freedom of speech. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't want you to have your freedom of speech. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=237.04s)]
*  They want to cancel you out because it's your speech that's the greatest threat to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=239.6s)]
*  Just like my speech is the greatest threat to them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Just like President Trump's speech is the greatest threat to them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=247.76s)]
*  That is what is on trial this week in the Senate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=251.12s)]
*  But I guess now trying to impeach a president is just a peaky peak. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  And I must ask, is this really how House Republicans want to use their narrow majority, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=259.84s)]
*  especially considering a lot of analysts believe they could lose the chamber next year? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Didn't they pledge to do something about inflation, gas prices, the cost of living? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=268.96s)]
*  Instead, all we are getting is infighting about a doomed impeachment inquiry and pointless [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=273.92s)]
*  messaging bills that are dead on arrival in the Democratic-led Senate, like a parents' [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=279.2s)]
*  bill of rights and a bill prohibiting the government from banning gas stoves. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=283.76s)]
*  No one's trying to ban gas stoves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=287.52s)]
*  It's governance by way of Fox opinion programming, and it has made this Congress [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=289.44s)]
*  one of the least productive ever. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=293.68s)]
*  As Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin said in a statement today, quote, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=295.12s)]
*  By August 2021, in the first six months of the 117th Congress, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=298.88s)]
*  House Democrats had helped kickstart our nation's economy with the American Rescue Plan [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=302.96s)]
*  and passed a budget with historic investments in working families. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=306.96s)]
*  We went on to pass legislation to reduce drug and energy costs, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=310.08s)]
*  address the climate crisis, bring jobs back to America, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=313.2s)]
*  and rebuild our country's infrastructure with groundbreaking laws like the Inflation [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=315.84s)]
*  Reduction Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=319.68s)]
*  By contrast, the first MAGA-directed Congress is by far the most reckless and least productive in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=323.76s)]
*  decades. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=328.96s)]
*  Congressman Raskin is right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=330.64s)]
*  These MAGA Republicans don't actually care about accomplishing anything. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=332.64s)]
*  They're all just constantly auditioning for guest spots on Hannity or Ingram. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=336.64s)]
*  And their latest cynical, ridiculous, doomed impeachment push is just the latest proof of that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icCxAU1bCA&t=341.2s)]
