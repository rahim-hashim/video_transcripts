# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo)
*  Ladoors Cordell served 19 years as a judge, including over a dozen on the Superior Court [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=0.0s)]
*  of California, author of Her Honor, My Life on the Bench, What Works, What's Broken, How [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=4.92s)]
*  to Change It. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=8.72s)]
*  Harry Lippman served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=9.72s)]
*  is now a legal affairs columnist for the Los Angeles Times, and both join me now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=13.64s)]
*  Judge Cordell, let me start with you because I'm particularly interested in how you think [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=17.52s)]
*  of this as a judge. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=21.04s)]
*  I mean, there is a lot of discretion given to judges over the timing of these things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=22.04s)]
*  You have a very unusual case here for a number of reasons, not just the ex-president who's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=27.66s)]
*  been indicted, but the campaign calendar. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=31.9s)]
*  How do you think is a fair way to evaluate a schedule, and how would you be approaching [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=36.18s)]
*  it were you this judge? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=40.42s)]
*  No trial judge with any experience who has assigned a case this gathering this much attention, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=44.7s)]
*  trial, would ever do anything in a haphazard manner. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=53.42s)]
*  So when Judge Chutkin came forward and said the trial date is March the 4th, you better [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=58.02s)]
*  believe that she gave it a lot of thought. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=63.5s)]
*  She has experience as a public defender, so she understands what defense attorneys have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=67.18s)]
*  to deal with in terms of going through documents. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=72.14s)]
*  But be sure, she gave a lot of deliberation to this, and I bet you she consulted, she [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=74.78s)]
*  may have consulted with other judges on the bench to kind of put together what is the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=81.56s)]
*  fairest way for both sides, understanding full well that the defense is entitled to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=86.12s)]
*  do process, the time to put the case together. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  So when she came out with this, it wasn't like, oh, come out on the bench and, oh, I'll [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=94.5s)]
*  just have a compromise date between what each side wants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=101.92s)]
*  Trust me, she put in a lot of thought in coming up with this trial date, and it's a date that's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=103.16s)]
*  firm. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, will it change? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Will someone could get sick? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=110.56s)]
*  Things can happen, but if the date is changed, it isn't going to be changed to two years [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=112.64s)]
*  out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=116.24s)]
*  Yeah, she said this during those arguments. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=117.24s)]
*  She said this to John Loro, I will say you and I have a very, very different estimate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  of the time that's needed to prepare for this case, when Mr. Trump will be treated exactly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=125.0s)]
*  with no more or less deference than any other defendant would be. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=128.84s)]
*  Loro, at one point, and Harry, I'd love to get your response to this, seems to be sort [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=132.0s)]
*  of flagging an issue for appeal, right, already in this hearing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=136.52s)]
*  He says, we will not be able to provide adequate representation to a client who has been charged [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=140.8s)]
*  with serious offenses as a result of that trial date. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=144.68s)]
*  The trial date will deny President Trump the opportunity to have effective assistance of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=146.88s)]
*  counsel in light of the enormous case. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=151.72s)]
*  Of course, effective assistance of counsel is something that you can use for opposed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=153.44s)]
*  conviction appeal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  What do you think about him using that language in that context, Harry? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=163.64s)]
*  He was already in a bit of a hole with her in this hearing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=165.2s)]
*  She said twice, turned down the temperature, and he had proffered that outlandish proposal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=169.05999999999997s)]
*  to go two years out. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=175.04s)]
*  So he is, without doubt, saying to her, you are violating the Constitution, Your Honor. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=176.64s)]
*  And of course, we will comply, but you're violating the Constitution, and we're going [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=181.44s)]
*  to bring this to the Court of Appeals. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  All of those things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=188.16s)]
*  I really want to second one thing that Judge Cordell just said. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=189.16s)]
*  Remember the very first day how there were several judges of that court who showed up, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=192.44s)]
*  including the Chief Judge. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=197.96s)]
*  I think it's quite clear that the whole court here, each of which has dealt with hundreds [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=199.12s)]
*  of cases under and has been including appeals, is really cohesive and thinking together of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=203.6s)]
*  this as a kind of test of the court. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=211.52s)]
*  And she absolutely can rely on her colleagues to reach a considered decision of what will [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=213.76s)]
*  hold up against a Court of Appeals. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=219.5s)]
*  The final thing is to say that while she did note the speedy trial interest, it's clear [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  she led, again, as the judges just indicated, with the due process rights of the defendant. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=227.28s)]
*  She's not going to get in the trap of suggesting that they are pushed back behind, below the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=233.92s)]
*  due process line because of the need for speed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=241.12s)]
*  That comes first, and that's just what she said. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=244.16s)]
*  So, Judge, you said, you know, so I've been talking to lawyers, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that is notable, right, is things get delayed all the time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=250.48s)]
*  I mean, this stuff can move very slowly, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  And it can be any number of reasons, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=256.8s)]
*  One of the lawyers had heart surgery or, you know, I mean, there's a whole bunch of things [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=258.68s)]
*  that can happen, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=262.32s)]
*  What's clear here, what's evident to everyone, and I think Judge Chutkin has been very clear [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=264.64s)]
*  about this, is there's a strong public interest in a swift trial. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=268.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and his lawyers don't want a swift trial, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  So the question now is, like, what can they do to throw sand in the gears? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  What would you be anticipating if you were that judge? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=281.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=285.04s)]
*  When a judge presides over pretrial motions, it's the opportunity for the trial judge to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=286.04s)]
*  size up who the parties are. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  How are they going to behave? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=293.56s)]
*  Who's going to engage in theatrics? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=294.56s)]
*  Who's going to be rude or maybe not want to follow the orders? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=296.36s)]
*  And what I did on the bench when I had a high-profile case and I knew that there were some issues, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  and this is what I do, you have the talk. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=306.6s)]
*  It's the judicial talk. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=310.76s)]
*  And the talk is very simple. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=312.8s)]
*  You look the litigants and the lawyers, all of them dead in the eye, and you say to them, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  and this is what I did when I presided over cases, I am going to give you the fairest [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  trial you have ever had. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=325.0s)]
*  And you are going to give me your respect and you're going to follow my orders. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Are we clear? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=332.36s)]
*  Generally, I would hear from both sides, yes, Your Honor, then we would move on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=333.92s)]
*  So it may be soon that Judge Chutkin, when these attorneys start again about maybe the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=338.32s)]
*  trial date, to have the talk, the judicial talk. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=345.52s)]
*  It certainly worked for me, and I'm not the only person, the only judge who has done this, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=349.36s)]
*  especially when you're a female judge, because sometimes we don't get the respect we should [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  be getting as opposed to a male judge, and also being a judge of color. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=359.0s)]
*  This combination is such that we have to make sure we are in control of the proceedings. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  So I encourage the judge, if she has to do so, and maybe she's already done it, to have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=368.98s)]
*  the talk early on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that seems, she has, by all accounts, and I have not been in that courtroom, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=376.26s)]
*  seemed to really control the space authoritatively. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=381.94s)]
*  Obviously, there's a judge who is both respected and has some real experience. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  This is Judge Eileen Cannon down in Florida is going to be providing over her third criminal [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=388.7s)]
*  trial or something like that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=393.2s)]
*  So this is a totally different universe. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=394.2s)]
*  I guess, when I keep coming back to Harry, and you said this, and other folks have said [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=396.12s)]
*  this, I've been watching coverage about this, that this is pretty hard, it's pretty set [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=402.24s)]
*  in stone, it might slip for small logistical reasons. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=406.44s)]
*  What are they going to try to do to make that not be the case? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=410.64s)]
*  There are two kinds of delays, Chris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=415.48s)]
*  week at a time, someone's, you know, I just had an emergency surgery or this very motion, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=418.2s)]
*  or we want an evidentiary hearing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=424.96s)]
*  And I think this March date builds in some of that, a month, two months, and still the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  nation's very strong interest in having a verdict before election is served. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=432.32s)]
*  The big way of eating up time is an appeal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=437.68s)]
*  And that, for example, I think will be happening in Fulton County where removal motions and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=442.44s)]
*  you can bet that Trump will bring it at the last minute are appealable. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=447.68s)]
*  But the different actions to challenge the whole case here, that Laurel has telegraphed, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=452.32s)]
*  that it's pretextual, that it's reprisal for Hunter Biden, that Trump has immunity, none [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=458.32s)]
*  of them at least has automatic right of appeal. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=464.68s)]
*  It will be up to Chutkin. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=469.0s)]
*  So assuming she's a strong gatekeeper here, then I think they have to go in little bite-sized [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=471.2s)]
*  chunks and that can't get them far enough. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  So the big issue is, can they get an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=479.24s)]
*  Even then, by the way, the Court of Appeals, I think, is prime for Trump's delaying tactics. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=483.48s)]
*  But absent that, I don't think they're going to be able to really eat up a lot of time. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=489.08s)]
*  Yeah, get an interlocutory appeal, an appeal by right, pre-trial, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  Can they find something that gets them there? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=500.56s)]
*  Which I think they do not have, but discretionary interlocutory appeals if Chutkin agrees. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=503.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=507.12s)]
*  And I'll see you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=508.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=509.12s)]
*  L'Doris Cordell and Harry Lippman, thank you both. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=510.12s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=512.44s)]
*  With the Republican frontrunner for the presidential nomination getting arrested all the time, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=515.12s)]
*  Trump's subordinates in Congress are doing everything they can to try to help him out, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=519.52s)]
*  including a plan to shift attention by impeaching the current president. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=523.36s)]
*  In fact, today, Donald Trump publicly ordered the House Republican caucus to get it done, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=527.04s)]
*  writing, quote, either impeach the bum or fade into oblivion. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=531.04s)]
*  They did it to us. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=534.4s)]
*  One of the most outspoken members of that caucus, Matt Gaetz of Florida, is now saying [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=535.4s)]
*  he doesn't even believe the House needs to vote to open an impeachment inquiry. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=540.4s)]
*  And according to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Speaker McCarthy is apparently taking direction from [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  That leaves the decision to Kevin McCarthy, ultimately. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=551.56s)]
*  Are you confident he's going to go with the impeachment inquiry? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=554.04s)]
*  This fall in September? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=556.48s)]
*  I am confident. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  And the reason why I'm confident is we had a House GOP call yesterday, and that was his [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  big push on the call. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=563.88s)]
*  So I think if we were to have the vote today right now, Kevin McCarthy would be one of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=565.52s)]
*  the first ones to vote yes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=570.08s)]
*  Now there is just one small problem with this plan. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=572.28s)]
*  Republicans have no evidence that Joe Biden committed a high crime or misdemeanor. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  As one unnamed Republican lawmaker told reporters, quote, there's just no evidence, and they [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=581.76s)]
*  can't impeach without that evidence. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=586.28s)]
*  I don't think the evidence exists. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=588.4s)]
*  Others have gone on the record with their concerns, including Don Bacon of Nebraska, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=591.52s)]
*  quote, I think before we move to an impeachment inquiry, there should be a direct link to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=595.04s)]
*  the president in some evidence. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=598.6s)]
*  So they have no evidence, no facts, nothing to suggest the president committed any high [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=601.52s)]
*  crime or misdemeanor. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=605.56s)]
*  But they're going to barrel ahead with an impeachment anyway. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=606.56s)]
*  What could go wrong? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=609.6s)]
*  David Jolley is a former Republican congressman of Florida, and he joins me now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=612.2s)]
*  What is your read of the calculus in the Republican House caucus and Kevin McCarthy on this? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=617.52s)]
*  I think this goes all the way back to the 15 votes to become speaker, Chris. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=625.44s)]
*  You know, I sat at the table with you during the speaker vote, and I said I didn't think [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=630.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy would be able to get the votes to become speaker, largely because I underestimated [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=633.34s)]
*  his willingness to sell the gavel to the MAGA crazy crowd. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=638.18s)]
*  But it was apparent then that part of his corrupt bargain with his caucus was a willingness [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=641.72s)]
*  to impeach Joe Biden. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=646.46s)]
*  He wouldn't come right out and say it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  But we know that many in his caucus wanted to move towards impeachment. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  I believe Kevin McCarthy made that promise, you know, eight or nine months ago. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  And this has always been the plan. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=656.64s)]
*  So he's headed there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  But I think it also speaks broadly to the Republican Party politics, internal politics, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=659.7s)]
*  even outside of the House, where they are convinced through Fox News and through just [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  a Republican echo chamber that the Biden crime family is real. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=669.46s)]
*  The problem is it requires this broad innuendo gap for them to jump from a complete lack [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=673.1800000000001s)]
*  of evidence to pinning it on high crimes and misdemeanors. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=678.58s)]
*  The evidence isn't there. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=681.6600000000001s)]
*  But Kevin McCarthy has shown us it doesn't matter. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=682.94s)]
*  He will sell out the institution, sell out the country as well the second time around. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  I want to be clear here, too, just about just to take a second on the on the evidence. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=689.98s)]
*  I mean, it's not even that the evidence isn't there. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=693.38s)]
*  The thing that they sort of speculate about, right, that they that they through hearsay [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=697.18s)]
*  and dot dot dot and someone told someone is a wild accusation that Joe Biden as sitting [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=702.42s)]
*  vice president was taking seven figure bribes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=709.3s)]
*  OK, that no one has figured this out all this time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=712.62s)]
*  This just happened and no one realized it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  But also, and this is crucial, it has nothing to do with his current presidency. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=718.54s)]
*  Like it's all about am I missing something? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=723.3s)]
*  There is no actual tangible thing on that that they are even pretending to allege exists. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=725.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=733.4200000000001s)]
*  And in many ways, their allegations have actually been disproven because at the heart of the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=734.58s)]
*  Hunter Biden investigation that's been going on for five years, the Department of Justice [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=738.46s)]
*  was this notion that somehow the influence peddling reached from the president's son [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=743.1s)]
*  to the vice president himself. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  And yet there was no evidence of that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=749.7s)]
*  If there had been, you better believe there would have been charges brought against the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  son on that and evidence about the president produced. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=754.46s)]
*  None of that, none of that has been produced. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=757.74s)]
*  And so I look part of this is the elevation of of this new group of Republicans that are [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=760.62s)]
*  devoid of ideology. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=766.22s)]
*  And this is simply now a witch hunt caucus. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=767.38s)]
*  We are seeing that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=769.82s)]
*  But the evidence just simply is not there and they fall on their face every time they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=770.82s)]
*  make an accusation. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=774.26s)]
*  Here's the thing about the politics of it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=775.5s)]
*  I remember, I mean, obviously, I was sitting at this desk for all through the Trump years [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  and watching Nancy Pelosi often really slow walk impeachment. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=780.38s)]
*  Al Green, a member from Congress, was like, look, there's stuff right now. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=785.58s)]
*  Day one. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=789.14s)]
*  And again, I think there were like, I mean, I think on the emoluments, I think there are [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=790.14s)]
*  a number of places where they had plausible cases. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=793.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=795.7s)]
*  The fact that he was was clearly sort of cross pressured and in conflict of interest as the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=796.7s)]
*  sitting president. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=801.9s)]
*  Put that aside. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=802.9s)]
*  Pelosi's concern was about the politics of it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=804.74s)]
*  I just don't see the 10 most vulnerable House Republicans wanting to vote for a Biden impeachment. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'm crazy. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=815.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=816.38s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=817.38s)]
*  But like, I don't even think they have the votes for that, which is why I guess he's [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=818.38s)]
*  going to do the inquiry without the vote. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=820.98s)]
*  Well, and the easier vote is the opening the inquiry, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=822.9399999999999s)]
*  Because it's wing district. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=827.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=829.26s)]
*  A Republican could say, well, we should at least go on a fact finding expedition, even [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=830.26s)]
*  if they're ultimately a no. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=833.1s)]
*  In this case, there aren't the votes even to open up. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=834.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=836.54s)]
*  So look, this will be an overreach should they pursue it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=838.3s)]
*  They are clearly doing it at the direction of Donald Trump to distract from Donald Trump. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=840.98s)]
*  Chris, I served with Kevin McCarthy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=845.02s)]
*  He has always been a vacuous individual, never one deep in policy, always about the politics. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=847.74s)]
*  He knows every congressional district. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=853.38s)]
*  But I did not realize in how unprincipled he was. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=855.54s)]
*  This is a manifestation of his lack of principles to say, I'm willing to shred the integrity [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=858.4599999999999s)]
*  of the House to sell out all of all of the history. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=863.18s)]
*  What you spoke of the slow walking of Nancy Pelosi to chase facts and be careful with [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  the politics. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=870.6999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't care about any of that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  He cares about one thing, his grip on the gavel. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  And if he refuses to move towards impeachment, you better believe Elise Stefanik waiting [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=875.9399999999999s)]
*  in the wings will say, I would move towards impeachment. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=879.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=882.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=883.3399999999999s)]
*  Really good point. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=885.5799999999999s)]
*  David Jelai, thank you very much. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAciRQg_Jyo&t=886.5799999999999s)]
