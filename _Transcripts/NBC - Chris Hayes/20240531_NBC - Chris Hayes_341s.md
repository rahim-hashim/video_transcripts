Video Description: “The lesson they learned is if you enforce this totalitarian unanimity, you can keep chugging along. And it is a wildly dangerous lesson. Because they will do this no matter what he does, and no matter how bad it gets,” says Chris Hayes on Republicans banding together to support Trump after his guilty verdict.

# Republicans face ‘mob-style’ push to fall behind Trump after guilty verdict
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A)
*  In some ways, the most revealing moment amid all the reaction to Donald Trump's conviction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday, which really flew under the radar, was an exchange online between one moderate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=4.4s)]
*  Republican and the Trump campaign worker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=9.0s)]
*  It started with former Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=11.96s)]
*  He's now running for Senate in that state. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=14.88s)]
*  And he left office, very popular in Maryland, a very blue state, and his presence in the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=16.32s)]
*  race as a Republican nominee creates a real issue for the Democrats. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  It expands the map for Republicans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=24.32s)]
*  Democrats now have to spend money on that race. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=26.12s)]
*  Obviously, a guy like that is going to have to distance himself from Trump, who's very [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  unpopular in Maryland. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=32.36s)]
*  And so he sent out a very carefully worded post saying, quote, Regardless of the result, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=33.36s)]
*  I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=39.08s)]
*  And you see how deaf this was when you look at the timestamp, 4 52 p.m., right in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=43.12s)]
*  sweet spot minutes after it was announced that a verdict had been reached, but several [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=47.72s)]
*  minutes before the verdict was read. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=51.92s)]
*  This was a response Larry Hogan received from a top Trump campaign official, Chris [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=55.2s)]
*  LaCivita. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=59.56s)]
*  You just ended your campaign. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  You Republican governor who dared to speak the very basic American tenet before a verdict, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=63.96s)]
*  we should respect the legal process. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=69.5s)]
*  You are done. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=71.36s)]
*  This was just part of the sort of mob style pressure campaign on Republicans to stand [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=73.88s)]
*  behind the felony convicted candidate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  Here's Laura Ingraham on Trump TV. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't help but notice and maybe it's changed over the last few minutes of the people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=84.36s)]
*  who haven't come out to condemn what happened in the in lower Manhattan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=88.6s)]
*  Haven't heard from Mitch McConnell again, unless it was in the last 20 minutes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=94.44s)]
*  Mitch McConnell stands up with the rule of law and all these great judicial picks and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=98.6s)]
*  silence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=102.72s)]
*  Lo and behold, almost an hour and a half later, Mitch McConnell dutifully put out his statement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=103.72s)]
*  These charges never should have been brought in the first place. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=110.0s)]
*  I expect the conviction to be overturned on appeal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=111.88s)]
*  This enforcement operation is happening because the Trump people and the Fox people and most [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=115.16s)]
*  of the people in the upper echelons of the party understand the only way to really bring [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=120.6s)]
*  Trump down to end his political career is if Republicans turn against him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  As long as they stay unified, no matter what he does, no matter how abhorrent or how dangerous [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=131.78s)]
*  or how criminal or how vile, no matter how much of a threat he is to the nation, if they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=137.83999999999997s)]
*  all band together, then in a polarized landscape, they can basically keep him afloat and make [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=144.76s)]
*  it essentially a coin toss. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=149.98s)]
*  That is why they dressed up like him during the trial and rushed to debase themselves [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=152.14s)]
*  in cringe inducing fashion on any live TV camera they can find. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  So this is like the Soviet style thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  Show me the person and I'll show you the crime. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=163.98s)]
*  This was a political smear job. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=166.02s)]
*  This was an attack job. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=167.62s)]
*  This is what you see in Banana Republic. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  This is the quintessential show trial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=171.4s)]
*  This is what you see in communist countries. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  This is the most outrageous travesty I've ever seen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=175.06s)]
*  And the problem here is Democrats have crossed this line. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  This is a justice system that haunts Republicans while protecting Democrats. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=180.74s)]
*  This was certainly a hoax, a sham. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=185.86s)]
*  Brian, yesterday was a sad day for America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=187.94s)]
*  You had a partisan witch hunt in New York. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  This is a total travesty. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=193.74s)]
*  I mean, we should not mince any words here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=195.06s)]
*  This is an extremely dangerous day for our country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  Do we want to become a country where we try to jail our political opponents? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=200.62s)]
*  The justice is on the court. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=204.78s)]
*  I know many of them personally. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=205.94s)]
*  I think they're deeply concerned about that as we are. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=207.9s)]
*  So I think they'll set this straight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=210.16s)]
*  There have only been two times in Trump's political career where that dynamic of Republican [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  unanimity is broken, where Trump was near political death. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=218.38s)]
*  So one was in the aftermath of January 6, the violent assault on the Capitol that he [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=221.36s)]
*  stirred up, when everyone was criticizing him, when the blood was still on the floor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=226.68s)]
*  of the Capitol, including Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=235.0s)]
*  Trump's approval rating dropped below 40 percent, just about the lowest level it reached. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=236.0s)]
*  Mitch McConnell was tested in the waters for a vote for an impeachment conviction. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=239.8s)]
*  If it had not been for that man, Mitch McConnell's abject, enduringly pathetic cowardice, and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  McCarthy's relentless quest to have the third shortest speakership in history, not to mention [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=250.8s)]
*  the legitimate fear Republican senators had for their families about violence, we wouldn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=255.68s)]
*  have this issue now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=261.04s)]
*  They could have just voted to convict him and bar him from future office. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=262.18s)]
*  Done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=266.32s)]
*  Ironically enough, the other time, the other sort of near political death experience was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=267.32s)]
*  in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=272.0s)]
*  Just about every elected Republican tried to distance themselves and criticize him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=274.72s)]
*  The only way to do that was to get him off the ticket. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=279.14s)]
*  But Trump managed to hold things together, due in no small part to the fact that right [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  at that moment, he got a guy named Michael Cohen, his lawyer, to pay to keep the porn [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=288.94s)]
*  star from talking. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=293.74s)]
*  And so the Republicans never heard about that story, nor did the public, which could have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=295.76s)]
*  been the political death blow. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=300.0s)]
*  The lesson he learned is, if you enforce this totalitarian unanimity, you can keep chugging [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=301.94s)]
*  along. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=309.1s)]
*  It's a wildly dangerous lesson, because they will do this, no matter what he does, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=311.62s)]
*  no matter how bad it gets. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Npk1anm6A&t=318.82000000000005s)]
