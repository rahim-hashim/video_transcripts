# Nikki Haley dropping out of debates was ‘big mistake,’ says New Hampshire GOP ex-chair
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw)
*  There was supposed to be a debate tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=0.0s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=2.0s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=3.0s)]
*  ABC and CNN both canceled the Republican primary debates they had scheduled ahead of next Tuesday's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=4.0s)]
*  primary in New Hampshire after Donald Trump and Nikki Haley declined to participate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=9.36s)]
*  Now, Trump also skipped the previous debates and nevertheless won Iowa with 51 percent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=14.0s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=18.96s)]
*  Nikki Haley has absolutely zero reason to do single combat with Ron DeSantis, who's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=19.96s)]
*  way behind her in New Hampshire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=24.12s)]
*  The Granite State looks to be make or break for Haley's campaign. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=26.2s)]
*  She's hoping independence will break for her. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=29.0s)]
*  The latest tracking polls are not looking amazing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=31.16s)]
*  So no more debates, no more drama for once. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=34.52s)]
*  A lack of drama might work to Trump's advantage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party who left the Republican [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=40.72s)]
*  Party in 2020. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Brendan Buck served as counsel to Speaker Paul Ryan and Press Secretary Speaker John [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=46.64s)]
*  Boehner and they both joined me now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=50.44s)]
*  Jennifer, let me start with you as someone who knows New Hampshire politics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=52.72s)]
*  What is your read on how things are looking there as we are just a few days away from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=56.16s)]
*  the primary? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=61.04s)]
*  Well, I would say that I don't I don't see I don't see things going well for Nikki Haley. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=62.04s)]
*  I think that dropping out of the debates was a big mistake. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=68.84s)]
*  Frankly, she seems to have forgotten that debates aren't supposed to be about the candidates. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=72.32s)]
*  They're about the voters. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=76.96s)]
*  And in New Hampshire, there's a strong sense of wanting maximum exposure to the candidates, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=78.64s)]
*  getting maximum information from them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=84.84s)]
*  And she needed something big and bold and different in order to kind of make up that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=87.32s)]
*  gap between her and Donald Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=93.16s)]
*  And she's just not doing it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=95.24s)]
*  Instead, what we're seeing are the numbers that came out yesterday. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=96.6s)]
*  Post Iowa actually have Trump higher. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=99.0s)]
*  He's over 50 percent in at least two of them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  And the gap between them is growing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=104.12s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, one of the things, Brendan, one of the things that sort of the question here [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  is about independents who it's not affiliated voters can vote in the New Hampshire primary. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  All the polling suggests those folks are much more amenable to Haley than Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=116.48s)]
*  But Republicans are much more amenable to Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  This, of course, is not anything new. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=122.76s)]
*  And New Hampshire has a wrinkle because there might be a lot of independent voters, but [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  it's still, as DeSantis said, an uphill climb to win a Republican primary if you're not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=129.08s)]
*  winning a majority of Republican voters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=133.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=135.6s)]
*  You have to be a conservative to win the win the primary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=138.72s)]
*  And I think Nikki Haley is certainly a conservative. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=141.16s)]
*  The problem is, though, that she has developed a bit of a reputation as being a never Trumper [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=144.24s)]
*  at this point. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=149.16s)]
*  And that's really working against her. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=150.16s)]
*  And her unfavorables are way higher than you would like to see. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=151.68s)]
*  It's the catch 22 that any of these Republicans have. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=155.04s)]
*  You need to go after your opponent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=158.08s)]
*  You need to go after Donald Trump if you're going to take him down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=159.32s)]
*  And they've failed to do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=163.12s)]
*  But if you do, like Chris Christie did, you become wildly unpopular with a lot of Republicans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=164.4s)]
*  There's no real good, safe place to go. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=169.84s)]
*  Now, ignoring him, I don't think was the right path. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  I think we'll look back and say that that was a big failure on all of their parts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=174.88s)]
*  But just to be clear, there was no easy way to beat Donald Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=179.12s)]
*  He was probably always going to be the nominee, but they clearly didn't bring any game changing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=182.64s)]
*  strategies that put that in question. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to your point, I think you're right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  Like, to the degree of some sort of like taint of being a never Trumper has sort of wafted [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=192.48s)]
*  over Nikki Haley, it's because she's running against Trump and doing decently well, hence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=198.6s)]
*  competing with him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=203.48s)]
*  And as a logical matter, that must be the case. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=204.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  Like this is a sort of inescapable by Jennifer that everyone has found. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  And I mean, it's the reason that you left the Republican Party fundamentally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=214.04s)]
*  I think there's some question of like, oh, does the makeup of New Hampshire voters like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=217.68s)]
*  this is the same and some poll just to show it, you know, among registered Republicans, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump's up by 40.6525 to Sanchez eight among undeclared. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=225.12s)]
*  It's Haley 52, Trump 37 to Sanchez four. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=229.76s)]
*  But again, it doesn't you don't think there's going to be enough of those latter category [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=233.8s)]
*  in order to tip the balance? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=238.68s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=240.76s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to me to hear the idea that Nikki Haley is being looked at as [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=243.88s)]
*  a never Trumper and that that's what's keeping her down. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=250.96s)]
*  Nikki Haley served in his administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=253.48s)]
*  Nikki Haley has already committed her vote to Donald Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=255.24s)]
*  Should he become the nominee? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=258.32s)]
*  But the I think the issue here is less about Nikki Haley and more about Donald Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=260.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's support in the Republican Party has been unwavering for eight years now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=265.96s)]
*  To Buck's point, there was never a chance that anyone other than Donald Trump was going [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=273.32s)]
*  to be the nominee. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Nikki Haley simply hasn't shown, I guess, the courage that is necessary to take on Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=280.8s)]
*  in a way that would actually impact his support within the voter base. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=287.6s)]
*  And in the primary, no matter what those undeclared voters do, in the end, the as you just showed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  in the numbers, the Republicans overwhelmingly want Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=299.92s)]
*  Brendan, to stay with us for a second, there was a moment where people and again, we don't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=306.12s)]
*  know what will happen on Tuesday. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=310.8s)]
*  It's possible the voters surprise us. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=311.8s)]
*  I was in New Hampshire in 2008 when everyone had written the obituary for Hillary Clinton's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=313.48s)]
*  campaign and it didn't work out that way. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=317.88s)]
*  She won that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=320.32s)]
*  She won that primary that led to a very, very long extended primary fight between Barack [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=321.32s)]
*  Obama and her. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  That said, there was a reason people didn't think they could dislodge him back after the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=329.08s)]
*  twenty twenty two midterms. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=334.08s)]
*  There was a reason all those people got in the race and his polling reflected it like [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=335.64s)]
*  do you think I guess the question is like how inevitable were things turning or were [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=340.32s)]
*  there missed opportunities earlier on? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=344.44s)]
*  So I think there's a couple of missed opportunities. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  One, I think it was a huge failure not to somehow draw him into any of the previous [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=349.88s)]
*  debates. He had no reason to debate, but they ignored him at the debates. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=354.0s)]
*  They didn't try to use his ego against him in any way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=357.52s)]
*  But I think probably more than anything, there was really no appetite at any point for that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=361.55999999999995s)]
*  So, you know, this was this was probably an uphill climb from the very beginning. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=367.24s)]
*  We'll see what happens on Tuesday. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=372.64s)]
*  Jennifer Horn and Brendan Buck. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=373.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eu4J9HYyw&t=375.32s)]
