# RIP GOP: ‘Devastating’ new evidence Trump still ‘owns the Republican Party’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4)
*  Today, we got new polling out that is devastating news for every Republican presidential candidate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=0.0s)]
*  not under criminal indictment. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=6.54s)]
*  The poll results could be considered funeral rights for the non-Trump Republican Party. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=8.9s)]
*  Simply put, it's done. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=14.34s)]
*  If you had any doubts that this is Trump's race and Trump's race to lose, this poll will [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=16.82s)]
*  clear things up for you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=21.3s)]
*  I mean, here is the headline from the latest New York Times, CNN poll, and it sums up everything [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=22.66s)]
*  you need to know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=27.54s)]
*  Trump crushing DeSantis and GOP rivals. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=29.0s)]
*  Among Republicans, the ex-president tops DeSantis with 54 percent, the Florida governor holding [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=32.54s)]
*  onto a mere 17 percent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  That is a 37 point lead that Trump holds over DeSantis, nearly 40 points. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=40.18s)]
*  And when the whole slew of candidates is put on the board against Trump, not one candidate [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=46.22s)]
*  besides DeSantis tops 3 percent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=50.36s)]
*  DeSantis even loses on fighting so-called wokeness in this new poll. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=54.34s)]
*  If you've been paying any attention to the 2024 Republican primary, you know that fighting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=58.42s)]
*  the woke is very dear to Ron DeSantis' heart. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=62.4s)]
*  Because it's a war on truth, I think we have no choice but to wage a war on woke. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=66.96s)]
*  On day one, we are going to rip the politics out of the military. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=71.52s)]
*  We're going to end the woke agenda. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=76.16s)]
*  Woke is ultimately assault on the truth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  We've made Florida the state where woke goes to die. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=80.8s)]
*  And as president, I will fight the woke and the corporations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=83.84s)]
*  I will fight the woke and the schools. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=87.62s)]
*  I will fight the woke and the halls of Congress. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=89.48s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  Stirring pseudo-Chichillian stuff, but when it comes to Republican voters who want to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=97.14s)]
*  fight wokeness, however they define it, Donald Trump again crushes DeSantis. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=102.06s)]
*  Look at the numbers, not even close. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=107.16s)]
*  Trump at 61 percent and DeSantis at 36 percent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=109.04s)]
*  That is a 25 point lead for the ex-president. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is also, by the way, the fun candidate apparently. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=115.32s)]
*  54 percent of Republican voters say he is more fun compared to DeSantis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=118.52s)]
*  Trump is also far ahead of DeSantis among Republicans who quote, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=123.0s)]
*  accept transgender people as the gender they identify with. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  And among those who do not, he beats Ron DeSantis on both fronts. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=129.72s)]
*  When it comes to Trump's criminal indictments on dozens of felonies, only 17 percent of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=134.64s)]
*  Republican voters believe he committed a crime. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=139.14s)]
*  71 percent believe he has not committed any. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=141.4s)]
*  But when that question is posted to MAGA voters, 0 percent, 0 believe he committed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=144.2s)]
*  a crime. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's not a cult. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  That is the ex-president's loyal base standing by his side, no matter what. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=153.32s)]
*  Simply put, Donald Trump owns this Republican party, he owns this GOP presidential race, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=157.72s)]
*  and no one is even coming close to beating him for the nomination. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=163.56s)]
*  In fact, no presidential primary candidate who has had this kind of lead in the polls [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=166.76s)]
*  at this point in the primaries has ever lost. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=171.56s)]
*  With the first primary debate in roughly three weeks, Trump has said he is not showing up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=175.08s)]
*  And honestly, why would he? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=179.56s)]
*  Today he posted quote, let them debate so I can see who I might consider for vice president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=181.8s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=187.44s)]
*  But he kind of has a point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=188.44s)]
*  Right now it is a race for second place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVDHhe45el4&t=191.0s)]
