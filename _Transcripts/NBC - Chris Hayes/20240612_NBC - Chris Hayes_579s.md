# Chris Hayes The Trump campaign’s ‘better off’ con game
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hates. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=0.0s)]
*  As we approach the first debate of this presidential election season, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=3.0s)]
*  earlier than normal between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=6.0s)]
*  it's clear, crystal clear, Trump and the Republican pitch to voters [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=9.0s)]
*  is fundamentally a con job. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=12.0s)]
*  I mean that in the most literal sense. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=15.0s)]
*  The term con job comes from so-called confidence men, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=18.0s)]
*  fixtures of the late 19th century, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=21.0s)]
*  who swindled their victims with their confidence. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Right now, that kind of false bravado is the defining feature [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=27.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump's attempt to win back the Oval Office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Remember, this is the man who tried to destroy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=33.0s)]
*  our Constitutional Republic live on national television, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=36.0s)]
*  and who utterly failed in overseeing the one national crisis [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=39.0s)]
*  he had to guide the nation through the pandemic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=43.0s)]
*  And yet, Trump and his surrogates are constantly telling voters [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=47.0s)]
*  to ask themselves the question, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=51.0s)]
*  are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=53.0s)]
*  They can't run on, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=56.0s)]
*  I don't think Joe Biden can run on the question of, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=60.0s)]
*  are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=62.0s)]
*  That's the one question he is praying that he never hears. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Are you better off under four years for Joe Biden [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=68.0s)]
*  or four years under Donald Trump? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=71.0s)]
*  You know, people are saying to themselves, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=73.0s)]
*  were we better off four years ago, or are we better off now, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=75.0s)]
*  and it wasn't even close? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=78.0s)]
*  That, by the way, was all from the past week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Now, we have been running a series here on All In, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=82.0s)]
*  and I'm responding to that very question, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=85.0s)]
*  because the events of four years ago were so disruptive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=87.0s)]
*  and shocking, unprecedented, and traumatic, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=90.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people, I would say most people, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=93.0s)]
*  partly myself included, to be honest, have just blocked it out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=96.0s)]
*  And again, I get it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't want to think about sitting inside trying to homeschool my kids [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=102.0s)]
*  or attending a Zoom Shiva for my dearly departed uncle, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=107.0s)]
*  or the indelible images of packed hospitals [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=111.0s)]
*  saying goodbye to their loved ones on iPads. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And of course, the fact that most people don't want to think too much about 2020 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=117.0s)]
*  is an enormous advantage to Republicans of the Trump campaign [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=122.0s)]
*  who are attempting to pull off this con job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=125.0s)]
*  Their aim is to kind of magically replace your memories, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=128.0s)]
*  to distract you from the fact that four years ago, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=133.0s)]
*  we were all living in the midst of disaster. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=135.0s)]
*  Tonight, the country has reached another sobering milestone [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=141.0s)]
*  in the coronavirus pandemic, surpassing two million cases. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=144.0s)]
*  In this warning sign, hospitalizations are surging in many states. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=148.0s)]
*  We're going to start our rallies back up now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=152.0s)]
*  We've had a tremendous run at rallies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=155.0s)]
*  I don't think there's been an empty seat, a big one in Texas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=158.0s)]
*  They're all going to be big. We're going to Arizona. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Texas and Arizona, among at least nine states, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=164.0s)]
*  reporting a jump in hospitalizations, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=167.0s)]
*  the best indicator of the virus' toll. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=169.0s)]
*  We're really doing a financial comeback. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=171.0s)]
*  The jobs numbers were fantastic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Still, one and a half million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=176.0s)]
*  almost 43 million since the pandemic began. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=180.0s)]
*  I think that the economy will be, next year, will be maybe the best it's ever been. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=184.0s)]
*  You can already see it with the stock market, how it's been going up, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=189.0s)]
*  because you have a lot of smart people that are betting on exactly what I'm saying. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=192.0s)]
*  A huge sell-off on Wall Street today, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=195.0s)]
*  amid new concerns about the continuing spread of COVID-19. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=197.0s)]
*  The Dow plunging more than 1,800 points, its biggest drop in three months. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=201.0s)]
*  And very important time in our country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=205.0s)]
*  A lot of things are happening, and I think when it all ends up, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=209.0s)]
*  it's going to end up very good for everybody. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=213.0s)]
*  There's growing concern tonight that relaxing restrictions [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=215.0s)]
*  is causing major increases in COVID-19 cases. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=218.0s)]
*  We need to protect lives. We all agree with that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=221.0s)]
*  But all the lives are precious, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=223.0s)]
*  not just the people who have been infected by COVID, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=225.0s)]
*  but also the people who are being driven to this because of the lockdown. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=228.0s)]
*  Here's what's happening in some of those places that have done a total shutdown. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Their poverty rate is going up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=237.0s)]
*  What are people going to do if they don't have jobs to go to, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=239.0s)]
*  to earn a living in order to take care of their families? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=243.0s)]
*  That's the main reason. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=246.0s)]
*  All of these scare tactics, they won't work this time around. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=247.0s)]
*  They will not work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I should note one week after Herman Cain made that appearance on Fox News, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=253.0s)]
*  he attended Donald Trump's indoor rally, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=257.0s)]
*  big indoor rally in the midst of COVID in Tulsa, Oklahoma. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=260.0s)]
*  And by the end of June, he was hospitalized with COVID, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=263.0s)]
*  and he died on July 30th at the age of 74. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Naturally, every time we do one of these segments, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=270.0s)]
*  I find that looking back at four years ago brings on a lot of emotion. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=276.0s)]
*  Most people divide recent history into the before times and the after times, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=281.0s)]
*  myself included. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=285.0s)]
*  A lot of us feel nostalgia for the before times. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=286.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what Donald Trump and his allies are using to build their lie [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=289.0s)]
*  about what really happened, to erase our real memories and implant false ones. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=293.0s)]
*  That is their project, and it has been unnervingly effective so far. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=298.0s)]
*  Four years ago in June of 2020, while we were all living through the trauma of the pandemic, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=302.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval rating was 42%. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=307.0s)]
*  Now in a new Monmouth poll asking voters to look back, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=309.0s)]
*  47% of Americans say they approve of the job Trump did as president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=312.0s)]
*  It's not much, but those five points are basically the margin of the entire election. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And they are accomplishing that swing, that con job, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=320.0s)]
*  through flat-out lies about what is really happening. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=323.0s)]
*  Take a listen to Missouri Senator Josh Hawley doing this today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=326.0s)]
*  He's going to run on his record from four years ago versus Biden's right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=332.0s)]
*  We have the new numbers out today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=335.0s)]
*  The gas under President Biden up 55%. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Groceries up 40%. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=340.0s)]
*  Wages down 3%. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=342.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the campaign right there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=344.0s)]
*  That's before we get to crime. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=346.0s)]
*  That's before we get to the Porter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Okay, so sorry, Josh Hawley, wages are up, decidedly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=349.0s)]
*  Average hourly earnings are actually up 17%, from May 2020 to 2024 in nominal terms, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=353.0s)]
*  like the groceries and stuff. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=359.0s)]
*  Wages have also crucially outpaced inflation for the past 13 months, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=361.0s)]
*  as Heather Long of The Washington Post pointed out today. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=366.0s)]
*  Crime, which Hawley mentioned, is way down. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=369.0s)]
*  Look at what has happened with the homicide rate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=371.0s)]
*  In 2020, when, right, Donald Trump was president, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=374.0s)]
*  he ushered in, under his presidency, the largest ever one-year jump, spiking 30%. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=378.0s)]
*  By 2023, the homicide rate had tumbled 19% to 5.3 homicides per 100,000 people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=384.0s)]
*  New data from the FBI shows the rate continues to drop off dramatically, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=391.0s)]
*  down another 26% in the first quarter of 2024 from the same time period last year. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=394.0s)]
*  Gas prices are, I will admit, overall higher than they were in the summer of 2020. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Why were they low then? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=407.0s)]
*  No one was traveling anywhere. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=408.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=411.0s)]
*  That's one of those cheap gas prices. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=413.0s)]
*  When everyone went, there was refrigerator trucks full of cadavers? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah, the gas prices were low. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=419.0s)]
*  And they spiked up in the early part of the Biden administration, the war in Ukraine, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=421.0s)]
*  but they've been trending in the right direction and continue to fall, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=425.0s)]
*  even as the summer travel season heats up. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=428.0s)]
*  Grocery prices are coming down, not just with inflation, which cooled to 3.3% today, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=431.0s)]
*  but retailers are actually now slashing prices on thousands of items. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=437.0s)]
*  Again, they spiked in the wake of the pandemic like they did everywhere in the world, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=442.0s)]
*  but they're on the right trajectory now, and all this is happening under the presidency of the incumbent Joe Biden. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=448.0s)]
*  And we are not losing thousands of Americans a day to the deadly pandemic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=454.0s)]
*  We do not live in a nation in the throes of constant disorder. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=458.0s)]
*  This time, four years ago, we were living through the televised murder of George Floyd [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=461.0s)]
*  and the protests and police response that followed, while then President Trump called for sending in troops. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=466.0s)]
*  Across the country, what started as peaceful gatherings protesting the death of George Floyd devolved into destruction. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=474.0s)]
*  From New York, where police and protesters squared off in the streets, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=481.0s)]
*  to Portland, where the mayor issued a state of emergency and a city curfew. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=485.0s)]
*  The nation erupted into scenes of chaos, violence, and widespread destruction into the early morning hours. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=490.0s)]
*  In some of the nation's biggest cities, the night spiraled out of control early. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=500.0s)]
*  We've just had to run about a block as police moved in. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=505.0s)]
*  We've been fired at with rubber bullets. My cameraman has been hit. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=508.0s)]
*  We've also seen tear gas being used. Here we go, they're moving through again. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=512.0s)]
*  This is exactly what it looks like. Exactly what it looks like. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=516.0s)]
*  Where the states are safely... [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=519.0s)]
*  Oh! Whoa! [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=521.0s)]
*  Oh. Amelia, can you hear us? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=523.0s)]
*  Amelia, are you okay? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=526.0s)]
*  We are really surrounded by the police and you really saw the way that they dealt with my cameraman, Tim. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=527.0s)]
*  They're quite violent and they do not care who they're targeting at the moment. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=532.0s)]
*  I said we have to dominate the streets. You can't let that happen. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=537.0s)]
*  And we're doing it with compassion. If you think about it, we're dominating the street with compassion. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=540.0s)]
*  All that happens under the watch of President Donald Trump. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=545.0s)]
*  We cannot say or hear that enough. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=549.0s)]
*  And if he returns to power, I am telling you it is a safe bet we will return to trauma and chaos. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoJ35ki3vQ&t=553.0s)]
