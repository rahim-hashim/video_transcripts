# See Chris and Joy react to Biden campaign rally in Michigan: 'Came alive'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw)
*  That was the president United States Joseph Robinette Biden holding a very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=0.0s)]
*  Spirited campaign rally in Detroit, Michigan tonight. We just took that live clocking in around 30 minutes before a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Exuberant crowd. I am Chris Hayes here in New York. I'm joined by my colleague Joy Reed, of course the host of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=12.96s)]
*  the readout just before me and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=20.0s)]
*  Joy, I want to first get my first read on this and again [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=23.28s)]
*  We've been honest throughout about the various [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=27.32s)]
*  Performances we've seen from this president from the debate the Stefanophilus interview [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=31.12s)]
*  To the the press conference, you know, that was by far [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=35.72s)]
*  I think the best performance he's given since the state of the union and and looked like that, you know [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  That's the Joe Biden that that gives been a very successful politician and won in 2020. I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=44.28s)]
*  Will say this it was the best [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=50.36s)]
*  Performance we've seen actually since the Waffle House a half an hour after [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=53.12s)]
*  That disasters debate and the reason I throw the Waffle House in there is that a half an hour after that performance [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=57.8s)]
*  He walked into a Waffle House in Atlanta and came alive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=65.32s)]
*  You know why because there were people in there the eye whoever on the Biden staff [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=68.84s)]
*  Made the deal to have him do a debate with no crowd and no people to respond and to bounce off of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=74.68s)]
*  That person should reevaluate their entire career because Joe Biden in all of my observations and I have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=82.0s)]
*  Seen him witnessed him particularly in a black church. He comes alive in front of a crowd [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=88.96s)]
*  He comes alive. It is people that make Joe Biden come alive. That was a demonstration of it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=94.0s)]
*  Whatever horse voice he even had yesterday in front of the press when he did that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  Really? Well done brilliantly done press conference a whole 49 minutes of policy talk did a great job [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=103.24s)]
*  Couple of Biden gas but that's Biden. Yeah, we just Biden but in this crowd [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=109.38s)]
*  I don't know if it was pastor Cindy Rudolph prayed over him before he started or did he just had the right oatmeal this morning with [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=113.94s)]
*  The right ingredients but that Joe Biden is the Joe Biden you get when there are people when there is a crowd when he can bounce [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=120.84s)]
*  Off of the energy of people that is what he actually needs in order to come alive [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=127.46s)]
*  And so I think what we've learned is that two things actually helped Biden thrive [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=131.78s)]
*  People a crowd that energy but also conflict [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=137.7s)]
*  everyone has come at this man the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=142.04s)]
*  Congressional caucus not the black caucus, but everybody else the more the white Democratic [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=144.94s)]
*  You know white Democrats have come at him the donors have come at him. So we're taking your 90 million dollars [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=149.06s)]
*  You won't even pay until you go away the Hollywood crowd have come at him and said unless you go we're gonna stop helping you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=153.44s)]
*  We're not even gonna help this campaign all of what you would call the elite came at Joe Biden and what happened? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=159.38s)]
*  Joe Biden woke up [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=164.78s)]
*  the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=166.98s)]
*  Conflict and the understandable, you know stress that you've seen among Democrats, but they really kind of ridiculous [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  public war of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=175.82s)]
*  Democrats against their own president [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=178.34s)]
*  Seems to have been the thing that he needed to catch fire and just very quickly the things that he did tonight that I thought [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=180.78s)]
*  Were very smart laying out his first hundred days in which he talked about restoring Roe v [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=186.46s)]
*  Wade talked about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  The voting rights act the John Lewis voting rights act something he wasn't able to get done without a Democratic Senate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=193.62s)]
*  Making the child tax credit permanent which is gonna help against poverty. He touted the fact that he took something very important [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=198.62s)]
*  Taking credit debt off of your credit report game-changing. He said he's gonna expand that get rid of medical debt [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=205.58s)]
*  The raising the federal minimum wage a huge and important thing that civil rights leaders like Bishop William Barber have been calling on him to do [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=212.3s)]
*  So he came out and he gave an agenda. I thought that was important [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=220.0s)]
*  And then also going on the attack against Trump. He called Trump Putin's puppy. He called him a convicted criminal [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=223.58s)]
*  He quoted the judge and saying not just sexual assault. He raped EG Carol [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=230.34s)]
*  He said he went bankrupt trying to run a casino didn't know you could do that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=235.5s)]
*  Then when he got protested he responded by allowing the protest to happen [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  Sobering up taking a moment and then touting his deal to end the war between [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=244.5s)]
*  Hamas and the Israelis [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  This was well done [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=252.14s)]
*  I can't say anything other than that's the Joe Biden who I think Democrats who might be nervous needed to see and for Democrats [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=253.22s)]
*  Who doubted him that was the come at me bro. Joe Biden. He ain't going nowhere [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=260.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I don't well we'll see I mean the future remains unwritten. I think he is he is dead set on not going anywhere [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=265.06s)]
*  No, he was to me that that was the also the most camp prank camp comprehensive [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  Thesis of the campaign like we haven't since the state of the Union that was like it's like what's the campaign? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=278.1s)]
*  It's like that's the campaign that speech is the campaign 30 minutes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=282.66s)]
*  It's Joe Biden is a is that it is you know, Joe Biden has a has a strong record [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=285.66s)]
*  Joe Biden has a vision for the future your point about the next hundred days and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=291.18s)]
*  Donald Trump is a menace [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=296.06s)]
*  And all of that the contrast Donald Trump is a menace sort of just completely unloading on the guy in every possible way [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=298.06s)]
*  January 6 sexual assault and then here's what I've done and here's what I'm gonna do those three pillars the guys in menace [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes, here's what we've done. Here's what we're gonna do. Here's what our shared values are. That is a comprehensive 30 minutes [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  That's the campaign. That's the first time I think and we've seen ads we've seen events [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  It's not like they're happening, but that is the like the tight 30 as they would say in stand-up like that's the that is the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=322.94s)]
*  That's the campaign right there. I think I we sort of saw that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=330.78s)]
*  I think I we sort of saw for the first time today [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=334.06s)]
*  It is and I think it was important also because he's in Detroit and this is a must-win state [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=337.18s)]
*  It has to happen right you saw that multiracial crowd behind him. That is the demographics that have to come out, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=341.94s)]
*  It has been African Americans has been black folks who have been solidly with Joe Biden all throughout these whole two weeks of Sturm [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=347.58s)]
*  And Drong inside of the party [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  But I think that what he understood tonight as you've said is that it's not just about bragging about the past [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  It is about whether or not this is somebody who can manage the future because this presidential campaign is partly about what he's accomplished [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  But it's partly about whether he can handle moving forward moving the the ball forward moving the ball down the field in a football [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=367.5s)]
*  Analogy what he did tonight is say here are my plays. I'm gonna go ahead and telegraph [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=374.26s)]
*  These are the plays if you put me back on it put me in coach put me back in this is what I'm gonna do for you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=384.7s)]
*  These are my deliverables and I think it was important to have those deliverables be about the working class [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  Being about the people that he is trying to keep on side and get on side [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=391.06s)]
*  It is those union workers. It is those working-class people of color and white Americans [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=396.02s)]
*  It's people who are saying I can't afford my rent [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  He said they're gonna go after these high rents that he then points out who the villain is these [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  You know hedge funds etc that are buying up all that property says we're gonna do that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=409.82s)]
*  We're gonna cap rent increases huge [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  It's a huge problem particularly among younger voters who are stressed in terms of their finances [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=415.98s)]
*  Tapping insulin for every American the $35 insulin you got for seniors. I said I'm gonna D said [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna do that for the rest of you that child tax cut becoming permanent [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=425.54s)]
*  That's actually game-changing economically if you are going to win an election [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=429.1s)]
*  What you have to do is convince people that there's a point to coming out and voting that I'm not just voting for your ego [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  Or to give you a legacy. I'm voting for me. What am I getting for myself? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=439.1s)]
*  What do I get out of this deal that first hundred days argument is the what I'm gonna get you if you come through for me [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=442.54s)]
*  That was important to do [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  This elections about the future we've been saying this all time [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=450.86s)]
*  But it's and it's and it's so important and so true and I think it has been a bit missing in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  In all the campaign stuff even in the discussion of the record, which is which is as we report on my show all the time [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=458.74s)]
*  Quite good. It's about the future joy read. Yes for sticking around. Thank you. Okay. Bye [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j43zH-QXw&t=464.74s)]
