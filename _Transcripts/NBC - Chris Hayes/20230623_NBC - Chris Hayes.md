# Russian generals accuse mercenary leader of mutiny attempt
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA)
*  There's a pretty wild situation unfolding in Russia tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House says it is monitoring. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  All started early this evening when that man, Putin's chef, Evgeny Prigozhin, the head of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a Russian-affiliated mercenary group that's been fighting in Ukraine, appeared to release [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=11.36s)]
*  a video on social media accusing Russian military leaders of misleading the country and its [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=15.9s)]
*  president Vladimir Putin over the initial reasons for the invasion of Ukraine itself. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=21.02s)]
*  Putin Prigozhin followed up, apparently, by posting a series of audio messages on the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=26.04s)]
*  social media platform Telegram, claiming the Russian minister of defense had personally [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=30.0s)]
*  overseen an attack on his fighters using artillery and helicopters, adding that, quote, huge [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=34.68s)]
*  numbers of his men had been killed and vowing to punish those involved, threatening to march [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=40.48s)]
*  his troops on the ministry of defense in Moscow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=45.18s)]
*  Russian state media reports the State Security Service, the FSB, opened a criminal case against [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=48.68s)]
*  the mercenary leader, quote, accusing him of calling for an armed rebellion, attempting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=53.76s)]
*  to start armed civil conflict in Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=57.96s)]
*  The FSB also called on Prigozhin's men to detain him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Russian civilians also saw emergency broadcasts cut into regular programming, asserting that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=64.48s)]
*  Prigozhin's claims were false and reading a Kremlin statement demanding the mercenary [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=69.94s)]
*  leader stop his, quote, unlawful actions immediately. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=75.16s)]
*  NBC News foreign correspondent Raf Sanchez is monitoring the situation live from Kiev [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=78.8s)]
*  in Ukraine tonight, and he joins me with the latest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=83.5s)]
*  Raf, this is a confusing situation with lots of people who we can't necessarily take at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=86.18s)]
*  their word, but what's the best of what we can determine at this moment? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=90.88s)]
*  Chris, it is nearly 3.30 in the morning here in Kiev. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=95.78s)]
*  It's the same time in Moscow. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=100.16s)]
*  This is a fast-moving and confusing situation, but here's what we know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=101.66s)]
*  In the last few minutes, the White House National Security Council has confirmed President Biden [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  has been briefed on what's going on inside Russia, which tells you just how high the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=110.54s)]
*  stakes are here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=115.54s)]
*  As you said, the Russian government is now accusing Evgeny Prigozhin, the volatile head [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=117.2s)]
*  of the Wagner mercenary group, of mounting a coup against the government of Vladimir [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=122.56s)]
*  Putin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  Prigozhin, for his part, having earlier said that the Russian military fired on his mercenary [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  troops, has now released an audio recording in just the last hour or so saying his mercenaries [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=135.48s)]
*  have crossed over from Ukraine, where they are supposed to be fighting side by side with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=141.64s)]
*  Russian regular forces, and that they are marching towards the southern Russian city [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=146.12s)]
*  of Rostov. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=151.16s)]
*  Chris, as you said, there are not a lot of reliable narrators here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=152.16s)]
*  Prigozhin is a man with a history of exaggeration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=155.76s)]
*  There is no firm evidence at this point that a column of his troops is indeed advancing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=160.64s)]
*  towards Rostov, but the Kremlin is not taking any chances. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=165.76s)]
*  This is a government that appears to be preparing for a military coup. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  Russian state media says the government has tightened security in Moscow and in other [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=174.6s)]
*  cities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  And, Chris, this internal fighting inside Russia, Chris, you may be able to hear the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  air defense here in Kiev is going off, which shows you that even as the Russians are turning [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=186.36s)]
*  on each other, either with words or with guns, as Prigozhin says, the war here in Ukraine [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  continues to rage, Ukrainian forces mounting that long-awaited counteroffensive, and they [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  are now hoping here in Kiev that they are facing an enemy divided amongst themselves. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=205.96s)]
*  Chris. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  Raf Sanchez in Kiev tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=215.84s)]
*  That was a great update. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=216.84s)]
*  I want to go now to Masha Gessen, a staff writer at The New Yorker who's been writing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=217.84s)]
*  about Putin's Russia for years, wrote an incredible biography of Putin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=221.48s)]
*  So Masha, we've been covering this on the show. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=225.6s)]
*  Prigozhin is this strange figure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  He's called Putin's chef. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=229.84s)]
*  He ran a catering business. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=230.84s)]
*  He's named in the Mueller indictments as the person that essentially oversaw the efforts [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=232.24s)]
*  to disrupt the 2016 election in certain cases. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=236.96s)]
*  He runs this Wagner group, which is deployed in Syria and all other places, in Mali as [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=241.2s)]
*  mercenaries. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=247.2s)]
*  He has been releasing these increasingly antagonistic videos over months going after Sergei Shoigu, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=248.2s)]
*  who runs the Russian military. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  And there's this question of like, is this real? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=255.72s)]
*  Is it performance? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=258.0s)]
*  But this looks real now, yes? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=259.52s)]
*  Oh, I think it's always looked real, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is what we've been looking at is Prigozhin is a very scary man. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=264.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  And he has served as Putin's enforcer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=270.76000000000005s)]
*  He has served as Putin's shock troops. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=273.72s)]
*  He's wielded private armies in Syria and now in Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=276.36s)]
*  And he's grown exasperated. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  And his exasperation has been basically reflected in what seems to be real time on Telegram [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  over the last few weeks especially. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  And the Ministry of Defense and the presidential administration has retaliated by basically [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=293.66s)]
*  telling him that he should know his place and effectively trying to get his private [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=298.46s)]
*  army under control, to get it subsumed by the Ministry of Defense once Prigozhin got [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=306.94s)]
*  a little bit too uppity. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=313.94s)]
*  This is Prigozhin's reaction today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  He has gone from criticizing Putin for not being decisive enough and not throwing enough [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=318.7s)]
*  resources at this war to saying, look, there was no reason to wage this war in the first place. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=326.06s)]
*  You have been lied to, you, my mercenaries, you conscripted men, you, the Russian people, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=332.38s)]
*  have been lied to. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=339.02s)]
*  There's no point in running in fighting this war. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=340.02s)]
*  People are getting killed for nothing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=343.06s)]
*  And he has called on people to march to Moscow to restore justice. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=344.82s)]
*  So this is very explicitly an attempt in military coup. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=349.88s)]
*  It may very well fail, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=354.16s)]
*  But most military coups fail. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=356.66s)]
*  A lot of military coups that succeed have looked less serious, certainly more ridiculous [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=358.66s)]
*  than this one. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=365.3s)]
*  Now we enter a territory of totally unreliable information. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=368.3s)]
*  We know there's military equipment in the streets of Moscow, which is what you're showing [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=372.66s)]
*  right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=378.06s)]
*  We seem to know that the building of the presidential administration in Moscow has been sealed off. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=379.54s)]
*  There are reports that Prigozhin's troops are entering Russia easily through the border, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=385.78s)]
*  even though there is a warrant for his arrest. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  But apparently, from what they're saying, right, and from what may or may not be independent [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  reports, the border guard are waving them right through. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=400.78s)]
*  Is it because they're uninformed or is this not really happening? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=404.14s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  The Prigozhin, I mean, the video he posted at the beginning about the origins of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  war was fascinating. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=413.54s)]
*  He had been, as you said, he was sort of a critic of the war from the right, basically [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=416.06s)]
*  that the Russian military ministry of defense and Shoigu, they weren't throwing their back [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  into it, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  Like, he's out there, his men are fighting and dying, and you guys aren't really committed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  to this war. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=430.94s)]
*  Today, he says basically, you've been lied to about the origins of it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=431.94s)]
*  It was because we had basically taken everything we could from the Donbass, eastern Ukraine, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  and the Russian elite grew greedy, that this was essentially like a, this was conquest. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=441.46s)]
*  It wasn't defensive. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=446.06s)]
*  NATO was never coming in. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=447.06s)]
*  I mean, a real, like, complete refutation of the story told about the war. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=448.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=452.94s)]
*  And I think this is actually important to the larger picture. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=454.46s)]
*  We have no way of knowing how viable this attempt at a military coup is, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=461.12s)]
*  These things are so strange, and they really, you know, they really depend not so much on [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=467.06s)]
*  military force or even public support. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=473.22s)]
*  They depend on a kind of game of nerves and credibility, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=476.06s)]
*  So we don't know how this is going to turn out. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=481.06s)]
*  But the larger point is that, you know, anybody who ultimately overturns Putin, because there [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=483.78s)]
*  are two ways that Putinism can end, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=491.82s)]
*  Either Putin dies or there's a coup. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  So if there is a coup, even if it is staged by a hardliner, it's going to be a hardliner [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03NzvCTYRDA&t=498.09999999999997s)]
