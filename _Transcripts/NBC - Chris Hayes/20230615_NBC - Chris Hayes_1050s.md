# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 14
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E)
*  Since leaving office more than two years ago with hundreds of classified documents, Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump has received consistently special treatment from the U.S. government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=5.92s)]
*  The federal government bent over backwards to offer the extra president, the ex-president, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  extra latitude. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=15.32s)]
*  They gave him opportunity after opportunity to return the classified documents that he [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=16.32s)]
*  removed from the White House and left all over Mar-a-Lago from the ballroom to the bathroom. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=20.88s)]
*  The special counsel Jack Smith's indictment makes clear they did everything in their power [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=26.52s)]
*  to avoid it all coming to this, which is prosecuting the ex-president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=30.96s)]
*  For more than a year and a half, they basically asked nicely before finally searching the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=35.04s)]
*  ex-president's Florida home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=38.32s)]
*  And when the special counsel did eventually bring charges, they did not include, and this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=40.6s)]
*  is crucial, the nearly 200 classified documents Trump returned in January of 2022 after holding [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=44.44s)]
*  onto those for a year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  As Eric Levitz smartly puts it in New York Magazine, the Department of Justice gave Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=52.98s)]
*  a pass on 197 potential counts of willful retention of national defense information. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  Instead, it charged him with only 31 counts, each corresponding with a highly classified [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  document that Trump knowingly withheld from the government in January 2022 and the FBI [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=67.66s)]
*  later obtained. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  That is not how an ordinary citizen would be treated. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  We know that because we saw what happened to, for example, Reality Winner. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=78.54s)]
*  In 2017, Winner, an Air Force veteran then working for a military contractor, printed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=83.86000000000001s)]
*  out exactly one classified document. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=88.78s)]
*  It was about Russian hackers gaining access to voter registration rolls during the 2016 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  She took the document home and mailed it to a media outlet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  Winner was subsequently arrested, jailed, and charged with violating the Espionage Act, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=99.62s)]
*  the same charge Donald Trump is facing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=103.9s)]
*  She pled guilty, apologized, was sentenced to five years in prison. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=106.54s)]
*  Reality Winner was the first person prosecuted by the Trump administration under the Espionage [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=111.7s)]
*  Act. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=115.54s)]
*  She received the longest sentence ever imposed ever for leaking classified information to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=116.54s)]
*  the media. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  Again, all that for one document compared to the 31 documents that Donald Trump took [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  and refused over and over again to give back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  Alison Krintner Allen is Reality Winner's attorney and she joins me now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  It's great to have you on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=135.94s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=136.94s)]
*  I guess I should start by asking how this all looks to you as someone who represents [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=137.94s)]
*  someone who did an incredibly long sentence for her single willful retention and then [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=143.34s)]
*  dissemination of a classified document. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=148.86s)]
*  I mean, thank you so much for having me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=152.02s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you, Chris. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=154.34s)]
*  I mean, it looks amazing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  I didn't know that the Justice Department had a red carpet to roll out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  It looks fantastic and we'd like to have that sort of treatment if we could. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=163.06s)]
*  So this does not look to you like from your perspective and representing your client like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=168.86s)]
*  this is a DOJ dead set on sticking it to the individual who is named in this indictment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=174.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, this looks like a DOJ and in fact a whole justice system that is bent on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=182.38s)]
*  giving him as much of the benefit of the doubt as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=191.78s)]
*  And I mean, that is a stark contrast to what Reality Winner faces, a stark contrast to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  what any of my clients have seen in the Department of Justice and in the justice system. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=205.88s)]
*  I mean, the idea that someone would be charged with espionage and then yet be able to travel [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=213.74s)]
*  internationally, it's bonkers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=223.46s)]
*  It defies logic. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=228.38s)]
*  And that kind of consideration isn't applied to, well, I mean, I haven't seen it applied [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=231.34s)]
*  to anybody before. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=235.94s)]
*  In your client's case, she was, the FBI shows up, they have tracked down that she was the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  one that leaked this document, they show up and they question her, I think, in her [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=243.34s)]
*  sort of apartment complex. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=249.58s)]
*  And then, am I right, she's taken into custody and she never sees the outside of a cell until [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=250.58s)]
*  she's released at the end of her time served? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=255.62s)]
*  Completely seamless. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=259.38s)]
*  She had several bond hearings and was denied bail over and over again, was seen as a threat [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=260.38s)]
*  security for one document that, honestly, the American people should have known about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=271.06s)]
*  anyway. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=277.86s)]
*  This is, and just to be clear here, this is someone who, when you're evaluating whether [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=278.86s)]
*  they should be free, right, this is a person who was deemed by multiple judges at the behest [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=283.42s)]
*  of the Department of Justice that requested this, as a threat to national security if [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=289.78s)]
*  she was bonded out, if she was allowed to be outside and not incarcerated, who, of course, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=293.26s)]
*  no longer had any access to any secrets of any kind. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=298.74s)]
*  She didn't work at the place she was. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  There was no plausible means by which she could. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=303.94s)]
*  No plausible future danger at all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=306.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=310.7s)]
*  And she had, she never had the kind of access that certainly a president has. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=311.7s)]
*  I mean, she was a low-level cog in a much bigger machine, and we're fairly certain that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  it's because she was such a small part of it that she was a little bit easier to kick [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=328.98s)]
*  around. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=334.22s)]
*  She didn't have the kind of footprint that most people who leaked to the press, and certainly [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=335.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, has. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=340.86s)]
*  I see what you mean. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=342.82s)]
*  So even when you're saying that, you're talking about, you know, there's this Sandy Berger, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=343.82s)]
*  very famous case, General David Petraeus, these are individuals who have extremely high profiles [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  and high rank within the national security apparatus or politically valuable. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=354.38s)]
*  That's what you mean. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=359.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=360.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=361.1s)]
*  I mean, you know very well that classified information leaks to the press all the time, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=362.1s)]
*  and for the most part, it comes from higher-ranking officials who want to push some kind of political [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  agenda or want the public to know something selectively that makes them look good. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  What is the future for your client? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=381.38000000000005s)]
*  I mean, as she watches this on roll, she's now out of prison. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  She's served her time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  Does she on probation now? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=393.98s)]
*  Like, where is she at? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  She's still on supervised release. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=397.22s)]
*  She's not allowed to leave the district, the southern district of Texas. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=399.86s)]
*  She will be on supervised release for the next few years, and she's consistently monitored [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=405.14s)]
*  by the probation department, who, I mean, she's about the most boring person to monitor [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=411.46s)]
*  at all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=417.58s)]
*  She's a coach, and she just takes care of animals and is living a delayed but her best [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=418.58s)]
*  life right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=425.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=426.14s)]
*  The pardon process goes on, and we're waiting for her time to be up to be able to apply [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=427.46s)]
*  for clemency and pardons. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=434.02s)]
*  Yeah, she's not hopping on any private jets or doing any campaign stops at Versailles [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=436.18s)]
*  Café. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, Chris, nobody even asked her if she had a butler that she needed to maintain [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  communication with. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=448.3s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=449.3s)]
*  That's an oversight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=450.3s)]
*  Alison Krintner, Alan, thank you very much for your time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=451.3s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  If the ex-president follows his usual strategy of delay, delay, delay to postpone his federal [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=457.86s)]
*  criminal trial in Florida, one of the people who has firsthand knowledge of Donald Trump's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=462.02s)]
*  tactics is former Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who began investigating Trump and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=465.62s)]
*  his family company back in 2018. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=470.9s)]
*  When Vance's office issued a subpoena for Trump's personal and corporate taxes, Trump [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=474.02s)]
*  filed suit to block it, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court twice. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=478.7s)]
*  It took 18 months before Vance finally got the tax records. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled in his office in favor. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=486.58s)]
*  And just over four months after that, relatively quickly, he charged the Trump Organization [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=489.34s)]
*  with running a 15 years long tax scheme. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=493.41999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, the investigation that Vance launched led to his successor, Alvin Bragg, securing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=496.34s)]
*  a tax fraud conviction against the Trump Organization in criminal court, along with a guilty plea [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=500.5s)]
*  from its former CFO, that man, Alan Weisselberg, and most significantly, as we know, a 34-count [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=506.18s)]
*  felony indictment of the ex-president just two months ago in Manhattan. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=512.38s)]
*  That happened nearly five years after Cy Vance began his investigation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=516.6999999999999s)]
*  Cy Vance, a district attorney from Manhattan from 2010 to 2022, joins me now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=521.5s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=525.5s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=526.3s)]
*  First, just maybe a little bit of your experience with that drawn out litigation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=527.5s)]
*  Obviously, in that case, there's some interestingly novel issues, I suppose. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=530.86s)]
*  Although in the end, the Supreme Court said, not really, sort of is like anyone else. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=535.18s)]
*  But what do you anticipate in terms of the success of delay tactics and even sort of basic things like that? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=540.62s)]
*  Well, our case was in a unique set of circumstances because President Trump was President Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=549.42s)]
*  Sitting president. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=555.42s)]
*  And when you're the sitting president, I've discovered there are many guardrails in the system to protect you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=556.22s)]
*  You can have, as he did, your attorney general oppose a subpoena in civil court. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=561.42s)]
*  You can have your solicitor general do the same. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=568.9399999999999s)]
*  You can have all the forces of the federal government is arguing his case was arguing his case, including in addition to his private lawyers. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=570.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=578.22s)]
*  And what I would say, those guardrails were frustrating, but I understood them and I think they're important. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=579.34s)]
*  You have to protect the president from routine or not routine from malicious suits. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=587.1s)]
*  And in our case, interestingly, given given the comments about politics being involved, the Supreme Court looked at twice the court's rule. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=594.14s)]
*  There was no evidence of political motivation. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=602.54s)]
*  And I think that's probably going to find the same in everything that's on today. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  But it took a long time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  But once we had the records and once we were able to get grand juries up and running because they were stopped under covid, it was a relatively quick process to present the indictment for tax evidence. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=611.1s)]
*  So my my sense is we were in somewhat unique and different circumstances than there are today. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=622.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=627.26s)]
*  He no longer has that protection. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=627.42s)]
*  He doesn't have the Department of Justice. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think I think the game plan for the defense is typically benefited by delay. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=629.66s)]
*  I mean, if your client is not in court, he can't go to jail. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=636.38s)]
*  So you and if he's not if he's not in jail, if he's not sitting in Rikers, then you want to delay as long as possible because he's free every day that he's not being. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=639.42s)]
*  But in seriousness, I think the judges, as your earlier panelists suggest, I think the judges will all try to move these cases as quickly as they can. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=647.82s)]
*  There are three different parallel running train tracks, civil in the AG's office in New York, criminal now in the Manhattan DA's office in a new criminal case in Florida. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=658.22s)]
*  And there may be more trains added or maybe more tracks. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=669.74s)]
*  You just mentioned Letitia James, of course, the attorney general of the state of New York, and she was speaking with my friend and colleague Alex Wagner yesterday. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=673.26s)]
*  And she talked about the sort of how this is going to work out jurisdictionally. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=679.9s)]
*  And here's what she had to say. Take a listen. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  The special counsel has asked for a speedy trial for this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=686.66s)]
*  Is is this going to intersect with your case at all? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=689.54s)]
*  How is everybody going to manage the calendar here? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=692.5s)]
*  So in all likelihood, I believe that my case, as well as DA Bragg and the Georgia case, will unfortunately have to be adjourned pending the outcome of the federal case. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=695.1s)]
*  So it all depends upon the scheduling of this particular case. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=709.5s)]
*  I didn't that that was news to me. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=715.0600000000001s)]
*  And again, this is not my area of expertise. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=717.58s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=719.9s)]
*  Well, it was news to me as a as a set rule. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=721.18s)]
*  I think the attorney general may be right in what ultimately transpires in terms of the schedules as we were talking about a civil case would ordinarily be trumped in terms of next page to a criminal case. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=725.2199999999999s)]
*  But having filed the Manhattan case first, even though it's only a matter of a month or two before the case in Florida, the Manhattan judge, John Mershon, excellent, serious. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=739.3s)]
*  He's going to want his case to move. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=749.82s)]
*  And that's what all judges want. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=751.82s)]
*  And so presumably will the Florida judge. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=753.1400000000001s)]
*  I think there will probably be communications amongst and between the judges, as well as probably amongst and between the attorneys representing the parties. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=755.58s)]
*  But as a general proposition, I think the odds are good that Florida will go first. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=764.82s)]
*  You do. I do. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=769.5400000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=770.46s)]
*  And you think that's because of a sort of again, there's not like some guidelines here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=771.46s)]
*  There's no like black letter, no rule regulation or rule. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=778.1400000000001s)]
*  It's just that the judges get on the phone with each other. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=778.42s)]
*  Well, I would I would hope so. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=781.34s)]
*  There's two judges. They got two different. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=783.34s)]
*  They got two different cases with the most strange and famous defendant in the country. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=784.74s)]
*  You have two different judicial systems, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=792.22s)]
*  Entirely separate and with their own statutory authority. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=794.26s)]
*  Yeah. So I would assume that representatives of the New York State Court and the federal court would have conversations, nothing improper about that, about scheduling. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  And there would be input, no doubt, from the parties. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=807.94s)]
*  So I think this will probably be a civil and that I mean, courteous process. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=811.1800000000001s)]
*  Judge Bershon is not going to want to be treated as a second class citizen and shouldn't be. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=815.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=819.4200000000001s)]
*  Nor should Judge Bershon not recognize that the stakes in the Florida case are about as high as they get and that we all should want that case to move. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  Appropriately and fairly, so I think it's a little bit up in the air, but I'd give I'd give the edge to the federal case. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=831.7s)]
*  There's a lot of expectation that Judge Cannon, just based on that first ruling, will bend over backwards to do what is in Trump's interest. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=839.98s)]
*  In this case, that would appear to be slowing things down, because here's the thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=847.0600000000001s)]
*  If the trial delays long enough, Donald Trump can convert what is a trial in a court of law into a literal trial of public opinion. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=851.0200000000001s)]
*  It's important to note here that all these criminal investigations into Donald Trump, from Jack Smith's classified documents case and January 6 case to Georgia's investigation of the Georgia election scheme and the New York indictment over hush money payments. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=860.22s)]
*  All of those investigations and cases were launched before Donald Trump declared himself a candidate for president. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=874.7s)]
*  In fact, we know from reporting that Trump actually moved up the declaration of his candidacy prior to the election. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=880.94s)]
*  He moved up the declaration of his candidacy precisely so that he could then claim he was being politically persecuted if indicted. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=888.8199999999999s)]
*  You see how that works? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=896.18s)]
*  So his plan from the beginning and now is to try to win the presidency so that chief among any other goal, honestly, he doesn't go to jail. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=897.8199999999999s)]
*  He can be above the law and he can drop the cases against him. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=906.9s)]
*  And even if he does not have a fair judge, this case is likely going to take a while to get to trial. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=911.38s)]
*  Which prompts the question, what happens with Jack Smith's other criminal investigation into the ex president's efforts to subvert democracy and incite a violent insurrection? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=917.42s)]
*  That investigation is ongoing. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=926.26s)]
*  It's not showing signs of slowing down. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=928.42s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, the same day Donald Trump's getting arraigned in a federal courthouse in Miami, two Nevada fake electors were spotted entering the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., where the federal grand jury meets for that investigation. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, there's Fulton County in Georgia, where District Attorney Fannie Willis is investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in her state of Georgia. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=944.78s)]
*  We are expecting a charging decision in that matter to come in a matter of weeks. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=954.1800000000001s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, there was a question as to whether her investigation would be delayed because of Trump's federal indictment. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=959.86s)]
*  Today, her office put out a statement quickly shutting down that idea, saying the federal indictments, plural, will not have any impact on their investigation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=965.1800000000001s)]
*  And get this, you may have caught this detail. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=974.66s)]
*  Yesterday, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said they sent personnel to Miami to sort of take in the scene and to prepare for a possible Trump indictment in their state, which would seem to indicate they're expecting an indictment. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=976.2199999999999s)]
*  But if the classified documents trial is delayed, I think honestly, just looking at the odds and looking at the timeline and looking at the calendar, the most likely outcome is that Donald Trump's not going to be tried before Election Day in 2024. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=991.3s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong, but that seems most likely. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=1004.46s)]
*  And so then voters are going to have to make a determination about this man's suitability for the highest office and land and whether he is above the law. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  And if that's the case, which, again, appears likely, it becomes even more imperative that the ex-president is charged and tried for his gravest crime that he committed, his attempt to end American democracy as we know it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObMzjzkG3E&t=1015.74s)]
