# Trump, RNC chair caught on tape meddling in Michigan 2020 vote, report says
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ)
*  Just weeks after the 2020 election, then-President Donald Trump personally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  pressured local officials in Michigan to overturn the vote in the state's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=4.44s)]
*  largest county. Now this comes from new reporting by the Detroit News which [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=8.56s)]
*  obtained recordings of that phone call from November 17th 2020. Now we actually [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=12.82s)]
*  covered this exact story as it was happening, though we didn't know about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=17.52s)]
*  the recording, at 8 p.m. on that Tuesday night just two weeks after the election. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=21.12s)]
*  Breaking news tonight out of Michigan where two Republican members of the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=26.54s)]
*  four-person board of canvassers in Wayne County, Michigan, who are tasked with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=30.82s)]
*  certifying the results the election have decided not to do that, citing virtually [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=35.62s)]
*  no evidence, a preposterously bad-faith move. Now Wayne County of course the most [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=40.94s)]
*  populous county in the state, it encompasses Detroit, it went for Joe [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Biden by over 320,000 votes, and the Republican chair of the board Monica [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=49.54s)]
*  Palmer is her names, says that she would be open to certifying the vote in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=54.86s)]
*  communities other than Detroit. This certainly appears to be a flagrant [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=58.46s)]
*  attempt by Republicans to just openly steal an election that Joe Biden won by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=63.18s)]
*  a hundred and forty thousand votes statewide in Michigan. And on the show [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  Michigan Secretary of State Democrat Jocelyn Benson told me she would not let [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=74.78s)]
*  this blatant attempt to cheat stand. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=78.56s)]
*  We have seen multiple attempts to try to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=81.04s)]
*  disenfranchise and undermine the will of our voters throughout this entire [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=85.12s)]
*  election cycle, particularly after the election since the the American people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=88.28s)]
*  have spoken we still see these attempts to misinform or confuse citizens about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=92.68s)]
*  the validity of the results. So this is simply an extension of that and a move [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=96.36s)]
*  in the other side's playbook to undermine the will of the people but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=100.36s)]
*  we're not going to stand for it we're going to ensure that every valid vote [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=104.16s)]
*  will count and that the certification of our results will be an official [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=107.28s)]
*  reflection of the will of the people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=110.12s)]
*  But Republicans were defiant they even celebrated the move. The chair of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=111.92s)]
*  state party Laura Cox, state Republican Party, wrote that she was quote proud [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=116.48s)]
*  that enough evidence of irregularities and potential voter fraud was uncovered [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  resulting in the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refusing to certify their [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=126.04s)]
*  election results. Of course that's nonsense, none was uncovered. The [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=129.72s)]
*  president himself tweeted that night quote, wow Michigan just refused to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  certify the election results. Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=136.52s)]
*  stands proud. We now know that behind the scenes Donald Trump was trying to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=140.12s)]
*  bully the Wayne County Republicans into doing his bidding of going along with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=144.4s)]
*  the coup. On the recorded call from November 17th, Trump told the two [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=148.52s)]
*  Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers that they would look [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=153.24s)]
*  quote terrible if they signed the documents to certify the county's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=156.36s)]
*  election results after they first voted in opposition. The then president added [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  quote, we've got to fight for our country. We can't let these people take [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=164.08s)]
*  our country away from us. It's kind of interesting. I've heard that rhetoric [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=167.24s)]
*  before. Another point McCall Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Romney McDaniel. You know her right? She's on the call too. She's you know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  helping them out. Tell the Republicans if you can go home tonight, do not sign [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=182.24s)]
*  it. We will get you attorneys. Oh looks like Ronna was part of the coup. And [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=186.0s)]
*  Trump concurred quote, we'll take care of that. Now luckily it didn't work after [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=192.2s)]
*  they hung up the president and after hours of angry responses from Wayne [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  County residents, God bless them, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=201.92s)]
*  abruptly changed course and certified the results of the November 3rd [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  election. The following day, the Republican members actually tried to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=208.44s)]
*  rescind those votes. They both signed affidavits saying they regret their [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  votes, arguing that quote intense bullying and coercion plus bad legal [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  advice forced them to agree to certify the election after they had voted no. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  They were unsuccessful and the certification went forward as it [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  should. As Secretary Jocelyn Benson put it quote, what started as the lowest [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=225.28s)]
*  moment of the post election melee became the most inspiring. The voters [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  won, facts and the rule of law carried the day, democracy prevailed. Joining me [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  once again is Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Madam [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  Secretary, I want to go back to that period of time because you wrote a long [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=243.32s)]
*  post about it that reminded me of how I was feeling. And I remember having the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=246.64s)]
*  same kind of wait a second feeling because what was at issue was that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=250.28s)]
*  there's a whole bunch of statutorily bipartisan boards that don't have a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=256.0s)]
*  partisan majority on purpose. And the whole point is for them to sort of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=261.08s)]
*  have this administrative function, which just say like, yep, these numbers [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=265.44s)]
*  line up, we got it, we certify. And that if all of a sudden you start [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=268.76s)]
*  radicalizing the Republicans on those boards to not certify, you can kind of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=273.76s)]
*  take down the whole integrity of the system. And tell me how you were [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=279.6s)]
*  thinking about it as this was playing out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=283.04s)]
*  Yeah, not just radicalize the members, but cajole and perhaps even bribe them [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  to break the law to further your political agenda. And thanks, Chris, for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  having me and, and reminding me that I was with you as all this unfolded play [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=294.44s)]
*  by play. It was quite extraordinary and remarkable to see, especially when you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  had hundreds of citizens show up and demand very cogently and with the law on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  their side that their votes count. It was really inspiring to see citizens have [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=309.92s)]
*  more power than the president of the United States even in that moment. Yet at [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=313.64s)]
*  the same time, we were also very much aware in that moment that Michigan and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=317.24s)]
*  Wayne County in Michigan was to be the first domino to fall in what has since [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  really been unveiled as this elaborate national scheme that went all the way to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  tragedy to our U.S. Capitol on January 6th, but began with inserting uncertainty [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=332.96s)]
*  and doubt into the certification process in Michigan that would have then been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=338.48s)]
*  used, as you saw the Trump's tweet at the time really was setting up to do to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=343.04s)]
*  challenge the certification in Pennsylvania, which was going the following [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=347.96s)]
*  week and then Georgia and Wisconsin after that. And so we knew we were the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=350.8s)]
*  first domino to fall. And that's why I was feeling so dejected that night, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=353.96s)]
*  because if we failed to stop that domino from falling, that was a win for these [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=358.0s)]
*  this election subversion attempt. And who knows what could happen next? And [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=363.56s)]
*  thankfully, it didn't fall. The people stood firm, and as a result, the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=368.76s)]
*  elections were certified and didn't stop the efforts in other states as we [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  know. But it certainly made it much more difficult and really paved the way for [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=380.12s)]
*  the failure of the entire effort. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=383.76s)]
*  I think if I'm recalling correctly, and there's a lot going on at the time, I [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=386.64s)]
*  think there was some contemporaneous reporting at the time that that that the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=390.36s)]
*  then President Donald Trump was actually reaching out to these individuals on the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=394.4s)]
*  on the canvassing board. But now we've got the smoking gun evidence, we got a [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=398.8s)]
*  recording of the call reported in the Detroit press. What do you think about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=402.96s)]
*  the fact that he is he is personally calling the Republicans on the Wayne [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=409.16s)]
*  County board to get them to go along with this plan, putting the full pressure [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=414.16s)]
*  of the presidency on them? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=417.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, when it happened, we knew I wasn't surprised. The reporting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=419.96s)]
*  in the Detroit News was the first time I had learned of this recording. But it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=423.88s)]
*  didn't surprise me the content of which we were already well aware that he was [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=427.32s)]
*  trying to pressure these local, you know, appointed officials to subvert their own [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=431.32s)]
*  duty, their legal duty under the law. We knew that as it was happening. And it's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=437.92s)]
*  really, you know, when you're up against the president of the United States, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=442.0s)]
*  right, the purported leader of the free world, and that we had the truth and the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  law and the will of the people on our side, it is really harrowing and scary, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  because you don't know, ultimately, and democracy is fragile, as that time also [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=457.56s)]
*  revealed to us. And and and when I was on your show in that moment, I didn't know [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=461.44s)]
*  how it was all going to play out. But you hope for people to follow the law and do [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=465.92s)]
*  the best in that moment. And the beauty of that night was that because citizens [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=468.48s)]
*  showed up and demanded democracy prevail, that that's the reason it ultimately did. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=471.92s)]
*  By the way, it's Detroit News, not the free press. I want to be clear because [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=478.44s)]
*  it's fantastic reporting and they should get credit where due you correctly name [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=481.12s)]
*  them and I didn't. What do you think about the RNC chair and fellow [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=484.64s)]
*  Michigander, Ronna Romney McDaniel, playing the role of essentially [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=488.72s)]
*  saying we will we the RNC will provide you with legal representation to to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=493.2s)]
*  break the law, to flagrantly violate and subvert election law. That to me is real [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=498.32s)]
*  news here, that the degree to which she was an accomplice in this phone call. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=503.8s)]
*  Well, you know, before that, she had held a press conference in Michigan with [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=508.2s)]
*  it was just filled with misinformation and lies about our elections. And so [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  again, no surprise to me, frankly, and we know the coordination and the amount of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=515.48s)]
*  focus on Michigan was clear as we were living through this. So I wasn't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=520.4s)]
*  surprised. It's in some ways validating and gratifying to see this additional [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPxVRRCjsuQ&t=525.56s)]
