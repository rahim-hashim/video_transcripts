# Biden campaign manager GOP debate was ‘race to an extreme agenda’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4)
*  The campaign messages from Republican candidates for president in 2024 are pretty full of darkness, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=0.0s)]
*  division, and a big sense of foreboding about the future of the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=6.08s)]
*  That stands in stark contrast to what we've been hearing from President Biden's campaign [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=10.32s)]
*  for reelection. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=13.88s)]
*  They made that point with a huge, that's huge for this period of time, $25 million [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=14.88s)]
*  add-by the week of the Republican debate to send a different message, including about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  how the United States has come back since the pandemic. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  In small towns and big cities, we're coming back stronger than ever. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=27.56s)]
*  Manufacturing jobs are coming home. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=31.96s)]
*  High-speed computer chips are getting made right here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=34.44s)]
*  America is leading the world in clean energy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=38.08s)]
*  There are some who say America is failing, not Joe Biden. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=40.72s)]
*  He believes our best days are ahead because he believes in the American people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=44.5s)]
*  Those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=53.24s)]
*  Never. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  Julie Chavez Rodriguez is the campaign manager for President Biden's reelection campaign. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=58.72s)]
*  Previously, she was a senior advisor to President Biden and was also a special assistant to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=67.4s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=68.4s)]
*  First of all, I'm so grateful you are here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=70.12s)]
*  You are running a campaign, which by the way is a very busy job, and you're moving to Delaware. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=71.6s)]
*  So thank you for being here with me tonight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=75.28s)]
*  So I wanted to start just with some of the news we learned today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=78.06s)]
*  You're a very savvy political operator. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, you're running a campaign. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=83.36s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to the prospect of a criminal trial starting on the day before [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=85.16s)]
*  Super Tuesday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=90.84s)]
*  Well, look, Jen, thank you, one, for so much for having me this evening. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=91.84s)]
*  And it's just, you know, I think we've seen such incredible support. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=95.84s)]
*  And you know, I definitely understand that those are matters that will continue to play [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=99.0s)]
*  out in the courts and obviously, you know, for their campaigns that contend with. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=103.16s)]
*  But what we're really focused on is just making sure that the American people really know [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=107.28s)]
*  what President Biden has done, what Vice President Biden has done to be able to support the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=112.88s)]
*  American voter, what they're doing to lower drug prices, to lower costs for families and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=118.52s)]
*  to make sure, as you saw in the ad that you just showed, that, you know, we're really [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=123.56s)]
*  reminding folks that America is back and that this president and vice president have made [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=127.8s)]
*  a tremendous investment, not just in the country, but in our people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=132.56s)]
*  I know you were probably watching the Republican debate last week, even as you're, of course, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=136.72s)]
*  talking about and portraying to the American people all the things President Biden has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=142.52s)]
*  done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=145.96s)]
*  What stuck out to you from that debate as you were watching it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=147.12s)]
*  What was a moment that stuck out to you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=150.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I think for me, it was really seeing that it was a consistent sort of race, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=151.8s)]
*  a real extreme agenda. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=157.44s)]
*  What we saw on stage were was maybe not necessarily certain candidates, but definitely their agenda [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=159.32s)]
*  and their policies were front and center. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=164.56s)]
*  And it was a real extreme conversation about, you know, banning abortion and having a national ban on abortion, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=166.84s)]
*  being able to, you know, take different approaches to, you know, addressing such critical issues. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=173.84s)]
*  It wasn't about real solutions for the American people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=179.6s)]
*  And that's what we're really focused on, is making sure that we're communicating that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=183.24s)]
*  contrast. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=187.0s)]
*  And what we saw on the debate stage, again, was a real race towards this extreme agenda [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=188.0s)]
*  that we've continued to see from so many of the GOP primary candidates right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=193.12s)]
*  And it's out of touch with the American voter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  It's so extreme. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  And we know that, you know, that's something that's not a real winning agenda or a, you know, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=203.08s)]
*  winning sort of campaign. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, I know you guys did an ad on abortion after the debate last week. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  And so it's telling where campaigns spend money, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Because it's where it sticks out in your mind and where you think you can have the biggest impact. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  How do you combat this argument, which also drives me insane, that many of these Republican [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=222.16s)]
*  candidates are making, that Democratic candidates want to, they support more abortions in a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=226.96s)]
*  third trimester. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=233.6s)]
*  They support abortion till 40 weeks, till birth. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=234.6s)]
*  It's just not accurate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=237.72s)]
*  And I think, you know, what do you wish people, what do you wish people were saying out there? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=238.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I wish that people really understood that, you know, the president and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=242.68s)]
*  the vice president are focused on restoring fundamental freedoms for the American people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=247.12s)]
*  And what we saw in the Dobbs decision was, I think, a real eye opener for so many women [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=251.2s)]
*  across this country, for so many families across this country, where all of a sudden, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, today in America, you know, my younger niece has less rights than I do. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=261.36s)]
*  And that's what, you know, people are really starting to see and understand about how just [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=265.44s)]
*  extreme their agenda is. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=271.08s)]
*  And what the president and vice president are focused on is restoring Roe v. Wade and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=272.86s)]
*  ensuring that that becomes the law of the land. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=276.58s)]
*  Because that's an important, you know, that's an important sort of right that we have fought [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=280.56s)]
*  for and we need to continue to fight for. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=284.54s)]
*  One of the moments that stood out to me in that debate was when the majority of candidates [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=287.66s)]
*  raised their hand and said they would support Donald Trump even if he was convicted of a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  crime. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=298.1s)]
*  Now, I know you're focused on a positive, proactive agenda that the president is implementing, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=299.1s)]
*  which is hugely important. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=303.98s)]
*  What impacts the American public? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=304.98s)]
*  But what was going through your head in that moment? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=306.7s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it just shows that all of them are really, you know, trying to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=308.74s)]
*  take the more extreme position and really trying to sort of take that, you know, race [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=312.54s)]
*  for the MAGA base and take, again, sort of just extreme positions that are out of touch [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  with voters. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=322.14s)]
*  I mean, by saying that climate change is a hoax is one example. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=323.14s)]
*  It's just absolutely out of touch with the reality that we're facing as a nation and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=327.74s)]
*  that we're facing as a world. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=332.94s)]
*  So I think, you know, we want to continue to just make sure that we are really showing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=335.22s)]
*  how extreme those positions are and that they're, you know, all sort of coming from the same [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  kind of policy agenda that we saw continue to lose in election after election. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=345.74s)]
*  I think one thing for us that's really exciting, in addition to seeing the kind of enthusiasm [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  for our campaign, is knowing that in the last 38 special elections, Democrats have outperformed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=355.88000000000005s)]
*  by 10 percent. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=362.26s)]
*  And that's something that we're going to continue to grow and continue to build on. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=363.26s)]
*  That's that's an important statistic. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=366.5s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people know. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=368.06s)]
*  Now, there are a lot of backseat drivers when it comes to running political campaigns. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=369.74s)]
*  I don't have to tell you, you're probably living that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=375.14s)]
*  I know that from working in the White House. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=376.9s)]
*  And what do you say to Democrats who say the president and the campaign, they should all [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=378.9s)]
*  be talking about Trump's legal issues and these criminal indictments much more. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=384.46s)]
*  And it's a missed opportunity. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=388.18s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the president, when he ran for office in the first place, was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=390.02s)]
*  really adamant about ensuring that the Justice Department was an independent department and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=394.5s)]
*  that they were able to execute effectively in the ways that they needed to. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=401.78s)]
*  And so, you know, we're going to continue to ensure that the Justice Department has [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=406.38s)]
*  the ability to do their job. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=411.82s)]
*  And what we're going to continue to focus on is just, again, the accomplishments that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=413.54s)]
*  this president and vice president have achieved thanks to, again, incredible legislation that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=418.62s)]
*  we've been able to pass, but also the choice that's before voters right now and really [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=423.02s)]
*  what's at stake in this election. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=427.41999999999996s)]
*  And you know, when we're dealing with a Republican field that is scapegoating immigrants, that's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=429.62s)]
*  talking about banning books, that again continues to focus on a national abortion ban, we just [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=434.46s)]
*  know that those are out of touch with so many voters across this country. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=439.18s)]
*  So every campaign looks different because they're happening in different moments in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=443.41999999999996s)]
*  time and you're trying to win to state the obvious. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=447.06s)]
*  What should people expect about how this campaign will be different from President Biden's [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=449.98s)]
*  election campaign back in 2020? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=454.98s)]
*  Well, we're really excited to be able to be headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=457.3s)]
*  As many folks know, it really is a home for President Biden. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=461.62s)]
*  That's where he's raised his family. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFkaEVyPL4&t=466.98s)]
