# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI)
*  Here's the thing about presidents and the economy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're the president, you're going to get credit if the economy is good and you're going [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  to get blamed if it's bad, whether or not you are the cause of either. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's a great example of that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=10.92s)]
*  Barack Obama and Democratic congressional majorities rescued the economy from the financial [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=12.6s)]
*  crisis of the previous Republican president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=16.88s)]
*  Then Donald Trump takes over and turns around and starts taking credit for the best economy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=20.28s)]
*  ever, even though he inherited an economy that had finally, after too long, gathered [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=24.16s)]
*  enough strength after the shock of 2008. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=29.04s)]
*  Here's what it looks like. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  This is the line of growth, the growth domestic product beginning in 2009 to January this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=32.8s)]
*  year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=38.16s)]
*  The shaded gray area in the middle there, that's the 2020 recession that happened because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=39.16s)]
*  of COVID. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's the average growth that happened when Donald Trump took office. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=43.96s)]
*  See how that's just like a straight line? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=47.72s)]
*  There's no big disjuncture there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=49.64s)]
*  It's not like, oh, oh yeah, that's where Donald Trump took over. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=50.96s)]
*  The Trump economy just continued on the trajectory that had been laid for it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=54.28s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump still got credit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=58.4s)]
*  If you look at the polling, he got credit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=59.72s)]
*  In fact, presidents' political fortunes are so tied to the performance of the economy [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=61.48s)]
*  that decades of political science literature has shown the best way to predict reelection [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=66.2s)]
*  for a sitting incumbent president is basically what the economy is doing in the election [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=71.56s)]
*  year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=75.6s)]
*  Now, historically, when presidents oversee huge changes in economic fortunes, their fates [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=76.6s)]
*  then rest on that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=81.82s)]
*  1981, Ronald Reagan takes over a time of stagflation and recession. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=83.8s)]
*  By 1994, the inflation had come down, the economy was growing, and Reagan ran with it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=88.52s)]
*  It's morning again in America. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  Today more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country's history. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly 2,000 families today [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=104.32s)]
*  will buy new homes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=109.44s)]
*  More than at any time in the past four years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=111.64s)]
*  It's morning again in America. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=114.32s)]
*  Every time I see that, I'm like, that was a really good political ad. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=116.84s)]
*  Morning again in America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=120.48s)]
*  Similarly, Bill Clinton took over. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=121.88s)]
*  He also took over during recession. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=123.84s)]
*  But by 1996, the economy was roaring and he beat Bob Dole. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=125.92s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden took over the American economy as president, one of the weirdest, most intense [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=130.84s)]
*  crises we've ever seen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=136.12s)]
*  It was something that the world hadn't seen in 100 years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  But he has turned it around. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=140.64s)]
*  Today he was in Chicago to take credit for what he called Bidenomics. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=143.04s)]
*  Folks, let me say as clearly as I can, the trickle-down approach failed the middle class. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=147.04s)]
*  It failed America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=154.28s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=155.28s)]
*  Bidenomics is working. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=156.28s)]
*  When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=157.28s)]
*  Today, the U.S. has the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=164.4s)]
*  pandemic, the highest in the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=170.56s)]
*  As Biden might say, that's true, folks, literally. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  No joke. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=176.72s)]
*  By all accounts, the Biden administration, the American economy is in a lot, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=177.84s)]
*  Less than two months into office, Democrats passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=181.32s)]
*  Party Line vote. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Then they passed the infrastructure bill that was bipartisan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=187.68s)]
*  Then Democrats, along with some Republicans, passed the $52 billion Chips Act. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=190.28s)]
*  And then they went on with zero Republican support to pass the sweeping $750 billion [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=194.72s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=201.2s)]
*  And all of that together really has changed the American economy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=203.0s)]
*  Here's a graph, GDP among the G7, right, seven richest economies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=206.72s)]
*  The yellow line, the top line there, represents the United States, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=211.64s)]
*  And the white dotted line in the middle represents pre-COVID GDP. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=216.96s)]
*  We are doing the best, again, that's not the seven richest economies, but the seven in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=221.56s)]
*  the G7. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  We are doing the best of any of our peers in the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  We have the highest post-pandemic growth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=229.16s)]
*  Look, that yellow line on top, we're beating everyone. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=231.08s)]
*  Here's another graph of inflation among G7 countries, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=233.84s)]
*  These are our peer countries. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=237.32s)]
*  This is the one where you want to be on the bottom. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  The United States is the black line there, right where you'd want it to be. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=242.08s)]
*  That means we have the lowest inflation, meaning the highest growth and the lowest inflation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=245.08s)]
*  Here's a graph of the U.S. consumer price index, which measures everything you can think [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=249.68s)]
*  of from when Joe Biden took office in January 2021 to this May, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  That's the measure of inflation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=257.88s)]
*  That red arrow on your screen is when Democrats passed the somewhat cheekily named, in my [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=260.1s)]
*  view, Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=265.72s)]
*  Look what happened after they passed the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=268.16s)]
*  Inflation reduced. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=272.06s)]
*  It went down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=273.58s)]
*  Inflation actually slowed in May to the lowest rate in two years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=275.7s)]
*  Right now, here's where things stand. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=278.82s)]
*  After all the disruption, after all the difficulty and the headwinds, we have one of the strongest [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=281.44s)]
*  economies in the entire world, stronger than any of our peer countries with higher growth [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=286.78s)]
*  and lower inflation and a booming jobs market, possibly one of the strongest economies we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=291.82s)]
*  have seen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=296.58s)]
*  I mean, according to the latest estimate, under the Biden administration, the U.S. has [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=297.58s)]
*  created about 13.6 million jobs since Biden took office. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=301.34s)]
*  That is more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  Part of that is due to COVID, of course, but it didn't have to necessarily come out that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=308.9s)]
*  way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  You get credit when you're there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  The unemployment rate in May was just above the lowest level since 1969. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  Consumer confidence is now coming back up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=320.34s)]
*  It's its highest level since early 2022. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=322.38s)]
*  That's when inflation really started to bite. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=325.29999999999995s)]
*  Rating starts surged last month by the most and more than three decades. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=327.76s)]
*  And in the post-pandemic economy, low-income workers are making huge wage gains, historic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=332.4s)]
*  wage gains. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=337.9s)]
*  We haven't seen them before. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=338.9s)]
*  We also have record investments in green energy, unbelievable amounts of clean energy now coming [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=339.9s)]
*  online. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=344.74s)]
*  We have unprecedented amounts of labor power, at least unprecedented in the 21st century, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=345.74s)]
*  that's for sure. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=350.28s)]
*  It has resulted in more unions forming and more strikes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=351.28s)]
*  I mean, this is in total, if it continues this way, if there is a soft landing, if we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=355.52s)]
*  avoid recession, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=360.24s)]
*  It is one of the most impressive macroeconomic interventions in recent American history in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=362.2s)]
*  the last 100 years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=368.64s)]
*  We end up in 2024 with these trends continuing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=369.64s)]
*  Joe Biden has one of the best economic stories to tell of any president in the last century, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  which is why he's going to be telling that story right here on MSNBC tomorrow in this room when he sits down for a live studio interview here at 30 Rock with Nicole Wallace. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=380.52s)]
*  Surrounded by dozens of educators and students, Governor Brian Kempf signed seven bills into law here at the Forsyth County Learning Center. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=395.52s)]
*  He signed the more controversial Parental Bill of Rights and a bill that would ban so-called divisive concepts from being taught in the classroom. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=403.96s)]
*  The governor also signed bills to ban certain books considered obscene from school libraries. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=411.96s)]
*  It's part of the moral panic around LGBTQ folks that is animating right-wing lawmakers and activists across the country. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=417.96s)]
*  Georgia's Republican-dominated legislature and its governor enacted a package of culture war laws last year. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=424.96s)]
*  The California Poverty Law Center writes that collectively these laws are called the Protect Students' Rights Act. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=431.4s)]
*  They include a divisive concepts law, a parent's bill of rights, and a harmful to minors law. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=435.4s)]
*  It allows for removal or restriction of materials parents deem pornographic or otherwise harmful. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=441.4s)]
*  The first bill tends to focus a lot of its explicit language on racial issues, backlash to the panic around critical race theory. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=447.4s)]
*  It also includes vague wording with room for interpretation around quote, not advocating for divisive concepts, whatever that means. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=454.84s)]
*  Cobb County School District fifth grade teacher Katie Rinderly found out just how broadly that term can be applied when she read the book My Shadow is Purple to Her Class. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=460.84s)]
*  The publisher describes the book as quote, a heartwarming and inspiring book about being true to yourself and moving beyond the gender binary. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=471.84s)]
*  She is now on leave and faces termination proceedings, the first known case of a Georgia teacher being ousted under these laws. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=479.28s)]
*  Katie Rinderly joins me now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=485.28s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=487.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us to tell what happened to you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=489.28s)]
*  You tell me, where do you teach and what kind of teaching do you do? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=491.28s)]
*  Yeah, I teach for Cobb County School District, more specifically Dewess Elementary. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=497.28s)]
*  And I am the gifted specialist lead at our school. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=502.28s)]
*  So I teach first through fifth grade gifted students. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=504.28s)]
*  And this book, My Shadow is Purple, how did you come about this book? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  What was the context for introducing it to the class? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=514.72s)]
*  I had purchased this book from our school's Scholastic Book Fair in February of this year. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=518.72s)]
*  And in March, my fifth grade students had the opportunity to vote on various book titles, picture books. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=523.72s)]
*  And My Shadow is Purple had the majority vote and it was selected to read as a class. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=530.72s)]
*  So you bought it at the school Scholastic Book Fair. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  Of course, a lot of folks are familiar with that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  I remember those those days very well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you had a sort of vote in the class, like a kind of what do we want to read together? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  They voted for this. You read them the book. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=549.1600000000001s)]
*  I want to just read a little portion of it so people get a sense of the book. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  I was reading it today and it's about someone who feels not like they don't fit neatly into either gender of the two gender binaries as constructed. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Some of my friends think I'm simply confused, but the thing I love most is not having to choose. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=565.6s)]
*  Some tell me I'm blue. Only blue can be strong. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=569.6s)]
*  But my mom's strong too, so I think they're wrong. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=571.6s)]
*  Some tell me I'm pink because pink's the most caring, but dad's always crying and loving and sharing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=574.6s)]
*  How did the book go over in the class? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=579.6s)]
*  Oh, it was wonderful. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=583.6s)]
*  Students had the opportunity to discuss the book's message that they received, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=584.6s)]
*  which was that of acceptance of not only themselves, but of others. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=588.6s)]
*  And truly valuing those differences within themselves and others and learning from them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  It was a wonderful book. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I really liked it quite a bit. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  Look, I think we're disposed to like it given what my view on gender is broadly, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  but it's not like a... I would not describe it as a militant book in any way or politically pointed. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  It's about someone who feels a little not like their self straddles different ways that we think about what's boyish or what's girlish [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  or what's manish and what's womanish and what's male and what's female, and they're trying to explore that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=622.48s)]
*  So what went wrong? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=625.48s)]
*  Like how did you hear this was... you were in trouble for this? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=628.48s)]
*  So two days after the book had been read, I received an email from my principal asking me to come to her office for a meeting [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=634.48s)]
*  and also received an email from a parent of a fifth grade student who also works in the district. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=641.48s)]
*  And it was brought to my attention that this book was deemed divisive and there would be an investigation to follow. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  So on Monday, March 13th, I was placed on administrative leave with pay and that continued until May 5th when the district let me know that they would be moving for termination. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  So is it your understanding this was initiated by a parental complaint was what initiated this proceeding? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  And that complaint was pursuant to the new Georgia law that passed with sanctions for teachers if they introduced divisive concepts? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=674.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=683.36s)]
*  It was very vague with how this book was brought to their attention. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=685.36s)]
*  The district and my principal was not ever able to describe to me or define how this book was divisive or what was so divisive about it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=690.36s)]
*  This is a book that is inclusive, not divisive. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  And children are especially harmed when they're not made to feel celebrated and validated for who they are and all that they bring with them into our classroom. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  The school district has now initiated what will be a sort of termination tribunal, I understand. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a process here for your possible termination. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to just read for you the statement from the Cobb County School District and it says, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=726.24s)]
*  without getting into the specifics of the personnel investigation, the district is confident this action, meaning their termination proceedings, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=729.24s)]
*  is appropriate considering the entirety of the teacher's behavior and history. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=736.24s)]
*  The district remains committed to strictly enforcing all board policy and the law. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=739.24s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=744.24s)]
*  I say that I have 10 years of incredible evaluations. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=747.24s)]
*  I think that speaks for itself. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  What is your understanding of why you have found yourself in this position? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  You read a book. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  Did you know when you were reading it, like, oh, I don't know about this, this is edgy, or I don't know if this is legally dubious, or was it, hey, this is a great book, the kids want to read it, let's read it? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  So in my opinion, these are complaints that are brought that are truly rooted in bias and prejudice. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=778.12s)]
*  And they're not centering students for what a learning environment should be and how students learn best. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=785.12s)]
*  This is about a book that validates students but also empowers them to learn how to communicate and collaborate with one another. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=795.12s)]
*  And to engage in discourse that's necessary for them to be able to collaborate and communicate with one another. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  So I truly think that students are not placed at the center of all of this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  It is these vague laws that truly chill education, chill educators, and limit the students' ability to actually have an environment where they are able to freely learn. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  The book is called My Shadow is Purple. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=837.0s)]
*  I read it today and I thought it was great. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=839.0s)]
*  And I thought it was, as you said, inclusive and about understanding and about maybe not fitting into the ways that people think you should be, but how that's okay. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=841.0s)]
*  And Katie Rinderle, who's a teacher down there in Cub County, Georgia, now facing possible termination for the violation of reading that book under Georgia state law. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=851.0s)]
*  Katie Rinderle, thank you so much for telling us your story tonight. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=860.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKECsB0QrFI&t=866.56s)]
