# ‘Disappointing’: Sgt. Gonell reacts to Republicans welcoming Donald Trump back to the Capitol
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc)
*  Before yesterday, Donald Trump had not visited the U.S. Capitol since before the deadly January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=0.0s)]
*  6th insurrection that he had incited in hopes of overturning a Democratic election and staying [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=6.44s)]
*  in power. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=11.6s)]
*  It was an insurrection in which even Republican lawmakers scattered and sheltered in fear [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=12.6s)]
*  for their lives. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=18.56s)]
*  And at the time, some Republican leaders harshly condemned Trump for it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=20.12s)]
*  There's no question, none. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=25.72s)]
*  That President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=28.76s)]
*  day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  All I can say is count me out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=41.64s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=45.22s)]
*  I've tried to be helpful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=46.22s)]
*  So you may have heard that Trump returned to the scene of the crime yesterday at the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=49.540000000000006s)]
*  invitation of House and Senate Republicans who not only greeted him as a victor, but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=53.6s)]
*  tried to retcon their earlier criticisms of Trump's tyranny. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=58.02s)]
*  Senator, how was it seeing the former president? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  We had a good meeting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=64.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=65.66s)]
*  We had a good time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=66.66s)]
*  He took questions from the audience and it was an entirely positive session. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=67.66s)]
*  Everybody in that room is dying for him to get back in office. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  It was the single best meeting I've ever seen between the United States Republican senators [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  and President Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=86.82s)]
*  And I can't wait to have him back. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=88.16s)]
*  Incredibly that glowing reception for from former Trump critics in the party was just [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=91.46s)]
*  the tip of a massive kiss up iceberg. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=96.24s)]
*  As Republican senators feted Trump with a birthday cake a day ahead of his 78th birthday, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=99.38s)]
*  and then they lined up to applaud and sing the praises of a dear leader who currently [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  holds no office, but does hold complete sway over their reelection efforts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=109.5s)]
*  He awaits sentencing for his Manhattan election interference conviction. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=114.5s)]
*  He's electric. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=120.18s)]
*  He's got an incredible fastball. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=121.18s)]
*  And I think that was just exciting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=124.22s)]
*  After all, he'd been through how strong this man is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=125.82s)]
*  He was the team captain and we were glad he was leading us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=128.46s)]
*  He said very complimentary things about all of us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=132.54s)]
*  We had sustained applause. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=135.38s)]
*  He said, I'm doing a very good job. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=137.74s)]
*  I mean, we're grateful for that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=139.26s)]
*  One of my favorite speeches. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=140.74s)]
*  He came in, talked to the conference, was very honest. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=142.7s)]
*  He was funny. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=146.44s)]
*  He was joking around constantly with everyone. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=147.6s)]
*  He was really sweet to me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=151.22s)]
*  He was electric. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=153.98s)]
*  Boogie woogie. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=154.98s)]
*  A lot of mainstream media reporting seems to be at a loss as to how to frame yesterday's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=155.98s)]
*  bizarre, unprecedented Republican embrace of Trump and his 34 felony conditions. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=160.14s)]
*  A lot of it read like this social media post from the Associated Press, who went crazy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=166.94s)]
*  with the adjectives, calling it a triumphant return that energized Republicans who were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=170.82s)]
*  reinvigorated by his White House bid. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  But if you zoom out for the big picture here, it's hard to argue with this description [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=178.34s)]
*  of the day's events. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=183.34s)]
*  From Talking Points memo publisher Josh Marshall on social media, quote, Pyongyang moment [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=184.34s)]
*  and the rotunda, the maniacal clapping in unison, Marjorie Taylor Greene almost breaking [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=190.14s)]
*  down in tears because Trump smiled at her total North Korean vibe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=194.78s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump is a man who, as president, showered praise on North Korea's dictator, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=199.5s)]
*  Kim Jong-un, exchanging love letters with him and pining for the kind of deference that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=204.5s)]
*  Kim got from his subjects. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=210.54s)]
*  Hey, he's the head of a country, and I mean, he's the strong head. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=212.94s)]
*  Don't let anyone think anything different. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=219.22s)]
*  He speaks and his people sit up at attention. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  I want my people to do the same. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  Nobody in North Korea would dare to think of indicting or convicting Kim Jong-un for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=227.9s)]
*  his crimes, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=232.18s)]
*  To Donald Trump, that's respect. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=233.86s)]
*  But you already knew this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  You probably remember during his presidency, there were plenty of ways Trump tried to emulate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=237.94s)]
*  dictators and strongmen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=242.22s)]
*  It was evident in the behavior that got him impeached twice and his burning desire for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=243.74s)]
*  a self-glorifying Soviet-style military parade with tanks celebrating him in the streets [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=248.86s)]
*  of Washington, an idea that his top generals had to talk him out of. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=253.5s)]
*  Those elements have always been there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=259.14s)]
*  But the difference now is that Donald Trump is a convicted criminal who is facing several [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=261.58s)]
*  more serious criminal trials, and he is desperate to avoid jail, to bend the entire American [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=266.26s)]
*  justice system to accommodate him, his past crimes, and any possible future ones. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=272.54s)]
*  And the Republican Party is prostrating itself before him, ready to help him in that task. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=278.7s)]
*  Former Capitol Police Sergeant Acalino Ganell was beaten by rioters with a flagpole while [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=284.18s)]
*  defending the Capitol on January 6. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  He writes about this in his book, American Shield, the immigrant sergeant who defended [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=291.38s)]
*  democracy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=295.26s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=296.26s)]
*  Acalino, thank you so much for your service. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=297.94s)]
*  Thanks for having me here, Jason Tay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  I want to start with this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=304.62s)]
*  I've also interviewed Harry Dunn. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=306.22s)]
*  I have a tremendous amount of respect for what you all did, what you continue to suffer. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  Just your first reaction to seeing Donald Trump, the man responsible for that violence, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=315.9s)]
*  walking back into the Capitol building, not in handcuffs, not in a jumpsuit, how does [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=322.9s)]
*  that make you feel? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=328.74s)]
*  It was very disappointing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=329.74s)]
*  All the sacrifices that we did on January 6 to keep all those same members that today, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=332.18s)]
*  yesterday applauded and greeted the former president as if he did something great at [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=338.54s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=345.54s)]
*  They were running for their lives, and they seem to forget how fearful they were running [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=346.54s)]
*  for their lives on that day. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=351.62s)]
*  It's astounding that, you know, instead of giving the police officers that type of recession, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  they had chosen to give that to the former president, the same guy who put their lives [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=361.82s)]
*  and our lives at risk. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=365.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's, you know, it can depend on the Republican elected officials any longer [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=368.26s)]
*  to defend the Constitution or the democracy because they only had 50 for one person, and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=373.62s)]
*  that person is Donald Trump. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=381.38s)]
*  I want to ask you a little bit about this because this is the part that gets me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=385.1s)]
*  I couldn't be any angrier than you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=391.06s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=392.42s)]
*  You were making mine, all of our audience's life safe. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=393.42s)]
*  I'm trying to keep it down. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=396.06s)]
*  It's infuriating to me, not just because of Trump, but how did it feel seeing these senators [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=398.94s)]
*  in Congress? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  Because as you said, they're hiding behind desks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  They're begging you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=407.5s)]
*  They're running down the hallway asking to stay in your apartment, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=408.5s)]
*  And here they are praising the same guy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=410.94s)]
*  Your friends who are still there, working there, does that make it difficult to go to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=414.5s)]
*  work knowing that these cowards? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=418.38s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=420.46s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that happened after January 6th is that I lost my career because [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=421.46s)]
*  of that horrible day. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=426.7s)]
*  And when I was still in the process of recovering, I had this struggle in my mind, like, OK, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=428.78s)]
*  what if there's another January 6th? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=436.3s)]
*  The Republican elected officials, are they going to have my back to help me close the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=439.02s)]
*  doors or do I have to watch the threat in front of me and them behind me? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=445.38s)]
*  So how can I do my job in a neutral way, in a impartial way that I do a split-second decision [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=452.14s)]
*  that is probably going to cost somebody's life or either mine or theirs or the members [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=459.74s)]
*  themselves? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=464.58s)]
*  And some of these members, on January 6th, they knew who put their lives at risk. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  And we did our job. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=470.82s)]
*  We protected both elected officials, both from Republican and Democrat, the same. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=471.94s)]
*  I protected your elected officials just the same way I protected my utility green or AOC [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=476.58s)]
*  or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer's. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=484.38s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=486.78s)]
*  And I can only wonder how the officer feel yesterday because it bothered me, and I wasn't [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=487.78s)]
*  even there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=496.02s)]
*  And instead of holding him accountable for it, instead of showing him and denouncing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=498.14s)]
*  him, they had chosen to welcome him as a hero, as if he did something great. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=503.3s)]
*  What was so great about an attack on the Capitol? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=510.94s)]
*  What was so great about offering pardons for the same people, blanket pardons for the rioters [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=513.86s)]
*  who attacked the police officers? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=522.1s)]
*  And now, like you said, he wants people to stand on attention, like a dictator, flaring [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=525.0999999999999s)]
*  with authoritarianism. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  And you have the whole backing of the Republican Party. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=535.5s)]
*  That's not Ron Reagan's party anymore. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=540.26s)]
*  Oh, no, no, not at all. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=542.3s)]
*  And I want to highlight this because it's not just national. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=543.66s)]
*  That's one of the things I think people need to understand. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=546.14s)]
*  It's not just the cowardly Republicans in this edition who are in office. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=548.18s)]
*  You were actually booed. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=552.14s)]
*  You and Officer Dunn were booed at the Pennsylvania State House. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=553.78s)]
*  I know, Harry, I'm helping you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=560.22s)]
*  How did that feel? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=562.38s)]
*  Because it's one thing, again, to have these sort of cowardly seditions, but to go to a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=563.5s)]
*  state house of regular men and women who you would think would understand what you do more. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=566.42s)]
*  How did that feel? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  And what do you think that says about where we are in America right now? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=572.3399999999999s)]
*  Those elected officials from the Republican side in Pennsylvania who chose to walk and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=575.06s)]
*  literally turned their back on former officers who defended their colleagues at the Capitol. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=580.98s)]
*  They don't have no conscience about what we did. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=587.4200000000001s)]
*  And if they did realize what we did on January 6th to keep all the mob, all members of the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=591.5s)]
*  mob away from the Capitol and actually saving their colleagues, that would be more receptive [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  to what we had to say. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=602.9s)]
*  We were there just to observe the chamber and we were not going to give a speech. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=605.74s)]
*  That was not our point. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=612.9s)]
*  But the mere fact that they recognized all the people that were in the chamber, all their [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=615.02s)]
*  visitors, and then when our name came up, they decided to walk away and jeer at us for [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  no reason. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  That was, to me, a slap in the face of the sacrifices that we did on January 6th. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=627.3399999999999s)]
*  We were officers at that time and they seemed to do the usual of election talking points [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=632.22s)]
*  that we support the police and they don't. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  If they did, they would have met with us, at least give us a chance to have a conversation, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=643.62s)]
*  but they were not even willing to do that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=648.5s)]
*  And show you the respect that you absolutely deserve. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=651.38s)]
*  First off, thank you so very much for your time. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=653.98s)]
*  You are an American hero. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=656.46s)]
*  Former U.S. Capitol Police Sergeant Acalino Ganel, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=658.1s)]
*  Thanks for having us tonight. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSpqS4d7Pc&t=662.18s)]
