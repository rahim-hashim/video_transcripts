# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4)
*  Just before our show tonight, we got some breaking news out of another Manhattan courtroom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=0.0s)]
*  A jury found former cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman Fried guilty on all seven counts against him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=5.0s)]
*  Prosecutors allege the 31-year-old founder of the FTX exchange used the company as basically a personal piggy bank and built a, quote, pyramid of deceit. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=12.0s)]
*  Last year, of course, FTX collapsed and Bankman Fried was charged with stealing tens of billions of dollars from his customers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=22.0s)]
*  After a month-long trial, the jury deliberated for just four and a half hours before convicting him on charges of fraud and conspiracy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=28.0s)]
*  Bankman Fried now faces more than 100 years in prison. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=36.0s)]
*  He's also facing another trial on charges including bribing foreign officials, which is scheduled to begin in March. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=39.0s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl is the host of the 11th Hour on MSNBC, as well as MSNBC's senior business analyst, and she joins me now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=45.0s)]
*  I gotta say, for a relatively complicated fraud, you know, white-collar case where you're looking at numbers and books, four and a half hours on every count is wow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=51.0s)]
*  This is stunning that it was so quick, and it speaks to the fact that the government rolled up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=62.0s)]
*  They took his closest confidants, his ex-girlfriend who worked for him, the top lieutenants in his company. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=68.0s)]
*  They all cooperated with the government, and they turned on him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=74.0s)]
*  And what was stunning was in the last week that Sam Bankman Fried, who, you know, is not necessarily the best communicator, doesn't present well, chose to take the stand. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=77.0s)]
*  And what did the prosecution do? Hit him right between the eyes and showed up with receipts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=86.0s)]
*  They used his own words and his own lieutenants' proof and said, no, sir, this is what you did. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=91.0s)]
*  And that's sort of what people are saying. He's almost as the ghost of Trump, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=97.0s)]
*  When you think about all the people that the government is rolling up against Trump right now, and could they turn to him and say, no, sir, these are your words, these are the documents. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=101.0s)]
*  And so the prosecution showed up with the receipts and boom, in four hours, guilty on everything. That's stunning. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think part of it, I mean, there's two things here, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=116.0s)]
*  One is the hubris of testifying for yourself. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=118.0s)]
*  Usually you don't do that, but this sort of idea of like, I can talk my way out of this, which I think. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=121.0s)]
*  But that's how he's always seen himself. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=125.0s)]
*  Yes, and he's even through this whole thing, he's been talking to reporters, he's been giving interviews like, bro, don't. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=127.0s)]
*  During this, he was taking phone calls from me months and months ago, right? I obviously wanted an interview. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=132.0s)]
*  I would talk to this man on the phone thinking, I can't believe this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=138.0s)]
*  But he has always felt like this business, this corporate world, I know better, which is the same thing he felt about politics and every other vertical. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=141.0s)]
*  He viewed people over the age of 40, you and me, useless. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I imagine there were some on the jury. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, part of the thing, too, about this case, as surprising as it is for a sort of complex case like this, again, it's not that complex. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=159.0s)]
*  But to come down so quickly is that the core of the crime was not complex, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=166.0s)]
*  Okay, you just hit everything. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=171.0s)]
*  Because people from the outside are like, oh, crypto, I don't get it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=173.0s)]
*  This isn't about crypto, right? It's about stealing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=176.0s)]
*  It is about saying, uh-oh, I'm losing money over here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=179.0s)]
*  I've got all these customer funds over here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=183.0s)]
*  You've got deposits in there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=185.0s)]
*  Exactly. I'm going to move A and stick it over to B, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=186.0s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding. You have just explained the crime. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=189.0s)]
*  Right? Sam Bankman fraud right there, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=191.0s)]
*  This isn't about how crypto works and the market went up and a margin call. Uh-uh-uh. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=193.0s)]
*  Yes. If your banker had a problem with sports gambling and was out to the mob and then just decided, well, there's a few thousand dollars sitting in your account. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=198.0s)]
*  Maybe he could pay off the guy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=207.0s)]
*  We all understand, like, absolutely can't do that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=209.0s)]
*  That's essentially the government's case against him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=212.0s)]
*  I'm going to defend him for one moment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=214.0s)]
*  One of the reasons he did believe his own hype is everyone else did. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=216.0s)]
*  Okay? The biggest names in finance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=220.0s)]
*  Do you remember that Super Bowl? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=223.0s)]
*  It was the most insane thing I've ever seen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=225.0s)]
*  It was the FTX Super Bowl. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=228.0s)]
*  And I don't just mean Tom Brady and Gisele. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=229.0s)]
*  You had some of the biggest investors, the most sophisticated investors on Wall Street that could make huge money. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=232.0s)]
*  Investing in this guy, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=238.0s)]
*  Last year, it was just a year ago, plus a few weeks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=240.0s)]
*  He spoke at a huge finance conference in New York. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=244.0s)]
*  Everybody rolled up there wearing suits. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=247.0s)]
*  That guy showed up in his Dungeons and Dragons look with the hair and the place worshiped the ground he walked on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=249.0s)]
*  So he believed his own hype, but so did everyone else. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=255.0s)]
*  And we shouldn't forget that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=258.0s)]
*  I actually, you know, in defense of the Dungeons and Dragons look, I respect a man that shows up like that, too. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=259.0s)]
*  But he is now, I mean, it's really wild. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=265.0s)]
*  I mean, talk about whatever. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=268.0s)]
*  It's sort of almost a cliche to talk about a meteoric rise and fall, which is a thing that we do in our line of work. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=269.0s)]
*  But wow, maybe you are. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=275.0s)]
*  I mean, the guy went from some random trader that no one had heard of to one of the richest people in the world and maybe worth like 30 billion dollars. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=277.0s)]
*  Correct. Correct. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=286.0s)]
*  To now looking at 100 years in federal prison. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=287.0s)]
*  And that whole thing happened over the course of four or five years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=290.0s)]
*  And thought he was going to change the world and change the world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=293.0s)]
*  The world operated, change politics. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=296.0s)]
*  He was intervening in Democratic primaries all over the place. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=298.0s)]
*  He was giving Mitch McConnell money. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=301.0s)]
*  But right there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=303.0s)]
*  So you're going to see in some media right now, people saying, don't forget Sam Bankman Fried deeply tied to the Democratic Party and Republicans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=304.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=311.0s)]
*  You interviewed Michael Lewis, who just wrote a massive book on Sam Bankman Fried a few weeks ago. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=312.0s)]
*  And Sam, Michael Lewis was with Sam as Sam was headed to Washington for dinner with Mitch McConnell, according to Michael's book, where he was going to potentially help Mitch. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=318.0s)]
*  According to Michael, he was discussing how much money would Sam have to pay Trump to not run again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=327.0s)]
*  He had a scheme to. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=334.0s)]
*  I remember Michael wrote the book saying this is a letter to the jury. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=335.0s)]
*  They'll decide. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=338.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=339.0s)]
*  I don't know. They decide. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=340.0s)]
*  I don't know if they read the book. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=341.0s)]
*  Stephanie, but they decided. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=342.0s)]
*  Always a pleasure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=343.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=344.0s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden called for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas to allow for more time to rescue or release hostages in Gaza. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=347.0s)]
*  According to Israeli military, more than 240 people are still being held nearly a month after Hamas's attack on southern Israel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=354.0s)]
*  One of them is Yarden Romangat. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=362.0s)]
*  On October 7th, Yarden, her husband, Alon, and their three-year-old daughter, Gafen, were visiting family Kibbutz Bari. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=364.0s)]
*  It's a small town near the border with Gaza. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=372.0s)]
*  Hamas terrorists attacked the community, massacring 120 people, including children. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=374.0s)]
*  They kidnapped others, including Yarden, Alon, and Gafen, driving them towards Gaza in a car stolen from the Kibbutz. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=379.0s)]
*  Just before they reached the border, some of the gunmen got out of the car and the family tried to run away. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=386.0s)]
*  As they fled with shots flying at them, Yarden handed her daughter to her husband. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=392.0s)]
*  Her husband managed to reach the woods where he hid with his little daughter Gafen until the next morning when they found Israeli soldiers and were taken to safety. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=398.0s)]
*  Yarden, however, was missing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=406.0s)]
*  Her family and the military believe she was recaptured and taken into Gaza after saving her daughter's life. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=408.0s)]
*  Gili Romang is Yarden's brother who has been working tirelessly to bring her home, and he joins me now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=414.0s)]
*  It's so good to have you here, and I first just want to express my profound grief and sorrow. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=420.0s)]
*  What happened to your sister? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=425.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=426.0s)]
*  Lots of people have all of them in their hearts and minds during this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=427.0s)]
*  Tell me about what your sister's like. You're the older brother? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=432.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=435.0s)]
*  What kind of person is she? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=436.0s)]
*  She's the person that would not like me to talk about her on TV. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=437.0s)]
*  She's a very timid and introvert person, a very caring person. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=442.0s)]
*  She's a physiotherapist, so she likes to take care of people, mostly elderly people. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=450.0s)]
*  This is her expertise. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=455.0s)]
*  And she's a very family-oriented person, so she mostly likes our own little circle of family. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=456.0s)]
*  We have two other little siblings, a younger brother and a younger sister. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=463.0s)]
*  Our mother passed away 10 months ago from cancer, and Yarden really held our family together, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=468.0s)]
*  making sure that we are still one unit together. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=475.0s)]
*  We just finished a three-week trip with her and her family to South Africa. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=480.0s)]
*  We came back a day before it happened. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=485.0s)]
*  She recently moved out of the kibbutz and was back visiting family on her husband's side. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=488.0s)]
*  True. They lived in the kibbutz, and she was not willing to tolerate what we call the routine. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=493.0s)]
*  Hopefully we'll never call it again. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=498.0s)]
*  The rockets in her head. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=499.0s)]
*  And she thought it's unacceptable to live like this, and they left just a few weeks before. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=501.0s)]
*  How was it first communicated to you and your family that the Israeli government believed she had been taken hostage? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=508.0s)]
*  Well, it didn't work exactly like this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=515.0s)]
*  What happened is that we got most of the information. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=518.0s)]
*  We found out that she is missing, that she's been taken out of the home due to information that we got from other family members. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=521.0s)]
*  So you were doing the information gathering as opposed to the other way around? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=529.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=532.0s)]
*  Yes, we, for example, it's hard to say, but we've seen a video of her mother-in-law, Kinaret, being taken out of the house. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=533.0s)]
*  So we knew that they had been taken. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=541.0s)]
*  And a few days later, we saw another video of Kinaret being killed in the end of the street of the house. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=543.0s)]
*  On the ground in her own pool of blood, it's horrible. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=549.0s)]
*  And after we've learned the story from Alon, after he's been rescued and getting into the Israeli troops, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=554.0s)]
*  I've been through the whole week in the area with our military trying to make them go and search for her. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=562.0s)]
*  So every day I was there from morning to night going with them and trying to make them search. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=571.0s)]
*  So all the information that we have, all the evidence we have, I have it first-handedly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=576.0s)]
*  And we gave that to the government for them to conclude. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=580.0s)]
*  What has the communication, obviously, it must just be unbearable to not know where she is and if she's safe. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=583.0s)]
*  And there's other families in this same situation. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=593.0s)]
*  Of course, too many families. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=596.0s)]
*  Talking with each other. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=597.0s)]
*  What is the government, what are they saying to you about what is being done about the prospects of her being released? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=598.0s)]
*  When you saw some of the hostages released, how did that hit you? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=604.0s)]
*  A lot of questions. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=608.0s)]
*  I will start with the last one. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=610.0s)]
*  I think that obviously when I saw the hostages released, I was very happy for them [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=612.0s)]
*  because I think it's the most happy moment probably in their life. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=616.0s)]
*  Yes, for everyone. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=620.0s)]
*  And I was also happy to see that it's possible. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=621.0s)]
*  Because until it happened, we didn't know if there is a channel that it can be done. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=624.0s)]
*  Like we know right now that it's possible to rescue. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=628.0s)]
*  It's a proof of concept, as it were. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=630.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=632.0s)]
*  Also, when we saw that it's possible to rescue some of the people by the idea, so it's a positive note. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=633.0s)]
*  At the same time, I don't read too much into it because Hamas is a very manipulative, dangerous maniac organization. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=639.0s)]
*  So the fact that they are being treated in a certain way doesn't mean almost anything to me about how my sister is being treated. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=648.0s)]
*  She might be tortured or got to be raped every day. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=655.0s)]
*  She might be in a very isolated place, different from the others. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=659.0s)]
*  So I cannot read too much into it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=662.0s)]
*  So I try to stay pretty balanced with all the manipulation that Hamas is trying to make us go through. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=664.0s)]
*  Basically, my sister and also us are still under continuous terror attack. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=673.0s)]
*  So she's under physical terror attack, but we are under mental and psychological mental attack that has not been stopped until today. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=678.0s)]
*  So this is how I experienced this incident. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=688.0s)]
*  Regarding the way that we communicate with Israeli authorities, they don't share a lot of information with us. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=691.0s)]
*  And I think that maybe it is wise. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=698.0s)]
*  You might be surprised because I believe in our forces and I believe that they are doing their utmost best. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=701.0s)]
*  So if they are doing that, I think it's better that they will not tell me. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=708.0s)]
*  So I will not be able to tell you on TV what is happening. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=713.0s)]
*  But we do get some feedback that they are investing a lot in intelligence and also in the way that they operate and make their military decision that they conclude in a top priority. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=717.0s)]
*  The hostages, which is a very big concern, either the hostages are in top priority or not. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=730.0s)]
*  So we believe they are at the moment. Yes. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=736.0s)]
*  And I see a very central role also to the U.S. government. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=739.0s)]
*  Also, the German government is also a dual citizen. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=744.0s)]
*  She's also German, so we are spending much time in Germany. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=747.0s)]
*  So we see a lot of commitment from those two countries and other Western countries. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=750.0s)]
*  I think it's vital because it is a basic duty of all of us to bring them back home because this is not something that we can allow to happen in the world. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=754.0s)]
*  This new standard of terrorism, of kidnapping so many people, if that will be tolerated by the West, not just by us as Israelis, by the whole West, that will be a disaster. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=766.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=779.0s)]
*  Your husband and the daughter, how is her daughter doing? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=782.0s)]
*  So initially it was a little bit hard, mostly at nights for Geffen, but she's very cooperative and also alone is super strong and resourceful. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=790.0s)]
*  Geffen is acting amazingly. She's cooperative. She's happy. She's nice. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=802.0s)]
*  And I think the reason for that is because she's aware she knows everything that happened. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=808.0s)]
*  But she's aware that doing that we are all doing our utmost efforts and she's hopeful. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=813.0s)]
*  She has trust in us and I think that we have to deliver. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=818.0s)]
*  So we are doing whatever we can do and we want everybody to share this hope with us, the hope that Geffen has and everybody to imagine what Geffen imagined. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=822.0s)]
*  It's that her and her mother are being you reunite. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=831.0s)]
*  So I hope deeply for that. I know everyone does. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=835.0s)]
*  Gili Roman, thank you so much for thank you. Thank you for inviting me. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=838.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YETzVfYiT_4&t=848.0s)]
