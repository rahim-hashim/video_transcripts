# Former judge ‘Clarence Thomas will recuse himself when Ginni flies’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y)
*  They've stayed this knowing the Supreme Court is going to get involved. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And we know the Supreme Court has been imperious in what it thinks it is its business to weigh [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=3.84s)]
*  in on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=9.84s)]
*  What's your first thought about this headed to the Toscotas? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=12.84s)]
*  Why do you think the conservatives would overturn Colorado? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=16.8s)]
*  I mean, woo, states rats, brother. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=19.76s)]
*  Isn't that what the conservatives usually look? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=22.44s)]
*  Of course, the Supreme Court is going to weigh in and likely overturn the Colorado State [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=24.96s)]
*  Supreme Court's interpretation of Colorado state law because the conservatives on the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=30.36s)]
*  Supreme Court, who usually go on and on and on about states rights, are hypocrites. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=35.24s)]
*  And they are comfortable being hypocrites. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=41.540000000000006s)]
*  And they will be hypocritical in this situation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=43.72s)]
*  And they will overturn Colorado's own state court process. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=47.16s)]
*  But they shouldn't. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=51.84s)]
*  When you're talking about writing this decision and what it must be like for the state court [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=52.88s)]
*  judge, I would like to point out that they were so aware of what SCOTUS was about to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=56.84s)]
*  do in terms of running over backwards that they literally quote Neil Gorsuch. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=61.28s)]
*  Neil Gorsuch, when he was sitting on the federal circuit in Colorado, they quote Gorsuch for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=67.28s)]
*  the opinion that Colorado gets to decide its own rules about who is qualified or not for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=72.48s)]
*  the ballot in Colorado. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  That's a Gorsuch opinion that they quote in the thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=82.04s)]
*  So if Gorsuch had any logical consistency, he would likely uphold the Colorado state [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=85.04s)]
*  court opinion. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=90.68s)]
*  But what we're about to see is just how, again, hypocritical and unserious the Supreme Court [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  is when it comes to protecting their partisan sugar daddies like Donald Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=98.56s)]
*  Yeah, let me read from that because we only saw this because of you pointing it out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=103.56s)]
*  So credit were due. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  They send this up to, you know, they know that Justice Gorsuch will almost certainly [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=111.0s)]
*  weigh on this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=114.88s)]
*  They say, as then Judge Gorsuch recognized in Hassan, this is the case they're citing, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=115.88s)]
*  it is a state's legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=120.04s)]
*  the political process that, quote, permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=125.16s)]
*  are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=130.6s)]
*  Judge Cordell, imagine you have the same interpretation that this is not an accident to, quote, Judge [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=135.32s)]
*  then Judge Gorsuch to possible Justice Gorsuch in possible Supreme Court review. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=140.72s)]
*  Yeah, these justices know who their audience is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=147.28s)]
*  And their audience is the Supreme Court. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=151.36s)]
*  They know this is headed that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=153.12s)]
*  And I will tell you, Chris, quite frankly, there should only be eight justices on the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=154.84s)]
*  Supreme Court hearing this case when it comes up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=158.96s)]
*  And I say that because Clarence Thomas has no business hearing this case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=162.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=167.04s)]
*  Because his wife was a major player in the whole insurrection. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=168.04s)]
*  And he should, he should, if he had principles, recuse himself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=174.16s)]
*  But I will guarantee you this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=178.88s)]
*  Clarence Thomas will recuse himself when Ginny flies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5icQ-hQi9Y&t=180.95999999999998s)]
