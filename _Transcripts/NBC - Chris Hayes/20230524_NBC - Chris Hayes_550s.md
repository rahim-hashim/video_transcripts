# ‘Epic disaster’: DeSantis 2024 launch with Elon Musk on Twitter flops
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A)
*  Do you remember that time that billionaire Elon Musk unveiled the new Tesla Cybertruck [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=0.0s)]
*  and when he went to demonstrate the vehicle's supposedly bulletproof glass, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=4.16s)]
*  they smashed two of its windows even though they weren't supposed to break? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=8.08s)]
*  Today's Twitter rollout of the Rob DeSantis campaign went kinda like that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=11.68s)]
*  We want to welcome you to this historic Twitter Spaces event and more broadly a first in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=19.44s)]
*  history of social media. Tonight I'm pleased to introduce two individuals who've done more to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=23.84s)]
*  loosen the grip. Sorry about that. We've got so many people here. So let's see. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=28.32s)]
*  It's like we just keep crashing, huh? Well, it's certainly an incredible honor to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  have Governor DeSantis make this historic announcement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=40.8s)]
*  Yo, it was like 20 minutes of that. Trump had the golden escalator, Ron DeSantis got the world's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=48.08s)]
*  most embarrassing 404 error. Over 20 minutes of technical difficulties that sounded like this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=56.08s)]
*  That is how the Florida governor's big entrance into the Republican presidential primary will be [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=62.72s)]
*  forever remembered. DeSantis chose to launch his campaign not during a campaign rally, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=66.72s)]
*  not on a televised event, but on Twitter.com with Elon Musk. And why? Maybe because Musk [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=72.32s)]
*  and Twitter are the best audience for the DeSantis brand crusade against woke. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=79.2s)]
*  This is a form of cultural Marxism. I think it goes back to this woke mind virus that's infected [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=86.16s)]
*  the left and all these other institutions. We will never surrender to the woke mob. Florida [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=92.48s)]
*  is where woke goes to die. DeSantis now officially a 2024 contender is knee deep in this kind of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  impenetrable sphere of contemporary right wing online culture war fights. Fighting the woke mind [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=105.92s)]
*  virus aligns quite well with Twitter. Its new owner, Elon Musk, has turned the platform [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=111.12s)]
*  into a right wing forum where he also rails against the woke mind virus, the same ideology [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=116.0s)]
*  embraced by DeSantis. Florida governor, who is apparently trapped in this online cultural woke [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  bubble, has chosen, for example, to fight with Disney for daring to speak out against him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=125.84s)]
*  Even one of his speech writers, a guy that he chose to hire, has effusively praised notorious [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=131.76s)]
*  white nationalist, Nick Fuentes. That's the guy that's writing his words. I can't tell you for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=137.28s)]
*  sure, but it does not sound like Ron DeSantis' messaging is necessarily resonating with the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=142.0s)]
*  Republican electorate. Two new polls released today showed DeSantis trailing Donald Trump by [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=146.96s)]
*  roughly 30 points. Florida Republican strategist Tim Miller recently pointed out DeSantis' campaign [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=151.6s)]
*  is a lot like Senator Elizabeth Warren's failed 2020 campaign, which relied on a smaller version [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=157.44s)]
*  of the electorate, a narrow but vocal audience. Tim Miller is a former RNC spokesman and current [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=162.48s)]
*  writer at large for the bulwark. Debbie Moore-Crissell Powell is a former Democratic congresswoman in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=168.48s)]
*  Florida. Both join me now. Tim, let me start with you and let me say something you say in the piece, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=172.88s)]
*  which is that the point you're making, the comparison, is by no means substantive at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=176.56s)]
*  It's purely at this level of where you're trying to fit in the primer. One of the points you make [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  is Elizabeth Warren had this campaign that was electric to a certain portion of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=185.44s)]
*  Democratic base. That proved not to be big enough to win the primer. You think DeSantis is the same [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=191.92s)]
*  problem, and before we get to that, oh my god, can you believe what happened? Well, I'm just thrilled [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=198.32s)]
*  because I don't know if you remember, but I was part of the John Huntsman presidential campaign [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=205.6s)]
*  announcement. We misspelled our candidate's own name on the credentials. We spelled it J-O-H-N, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  which to me was so shameful and embarrassing, and by comparison, we crushed it. So thank you to the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  Ron DeSantis team for making our little small gaffe there look very manageable by comparison, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=221.52s)]
*  because that was just an epic disaster. Like you, Chris, I'm a Twitter addict. It took me a while [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=228.0s)]
*  to figure out how to get in, because the first two or three spaces, they started to crash. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  So I was in an old one, just listening to random ringing noises and people whispering. It was an [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=240.72s)]
*  utter disaster. Half the audience disappeared by the time they got it going, and the messaging, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=246.32s)]
*  and I think this speaks to Elizabeth Warren thing. Like you said, this is not about the substance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=252.16s)]
*  This is about from a strategic standpoint. Elizabeth Warren, I think, made a mistake, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=256.32s)]
*  thinking that she could triple down on the very excited, college-educated, progressive base [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=260.8s)]
*  and what their concerns were and spoke in their language, whereas Joe Biden was more successful [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=266.4s)]
*  reaching out to a broader part of the Democratic coalition, and he ends up winning. DeSantis now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=271.84s)]
*  is stuck. He's in this Twitter space with David Sacks and Elon Musk, a hundred-millionaire and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=276.64s)]
*  a billionaire who don't like their fellow rich tech people, because they think they're too woke. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  They have all these weird concerns about digital currency and ESG and woke board stuff, and they're [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=288.32s)]
*  talking about this in this Twitter space, and it's like, well, I mean, an average MAGA voter [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=296.72s)]
*  living in Spartanburg, South Carolina, first can't get into the space. If they could, all they heard [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=302.56s)]
*  was ringing noises, and then if they finally made it in, they're listening to these three rich white [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=308.0s)]
*  guys talk about a very niche concern of super wealthy, college-educated Republican contrarians, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  and there aren't enough of those to win a primary. I can promise you that much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=320.0s)]
*  Well, and it's interesting, too, that Trump keeps saying he wants to cut Social Security. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=324.24s)]
*  Like, that's what Trump says. You want to vote for the guy who wants to cut Social [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=327.6s)]
*  Security and Medicare? That's what this guy wants to do. It's like, yeah, that has a broad appeal. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that appeals across. There's also, Debbie, you and I spoke about this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=336.88s)]
*  when I was in Florida of just who this guy is, a candidate. I mean, there's a choice here to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=341.52s)]
*  court Musk and to do this audio only, but you think you want to create some set piece where he's, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=348.32s)]
*  he looks commanding or he's giving a good speech, and I wonder what you think of just his ability [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=355.44s)]
*  as a communicator outside of the sphere of the Twitter space's bubble when it was working, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=360.4s)]
*  which it sort of barely did. I mean, the announcement was so well-staged. He basically [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=365.92s)]
*  was reading from a piece of paper the announcement, and all the questions that were asked were [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=372.4s)]
*  obviously pre-prepared questions that he had a prepared answer for. I mean, the man cannot [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=377.28s)]
*  communicate well. He cannot connect with a larger audience. He cannot answer tough questions. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=382.96s)]
*  And so this reminded me really, Chris, of state-sponsored propaganda. I feel like it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=389.2s)]
*  was a DeSantis Musk propaganda machine. It was a massive spread of misinformation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=394.55999999999995s)]
*  They used this platform to talk falsely about COVID, which, as you mentioned, really affected [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=401.11999999999995s)]
*  millions of Americans and left millions dead because of the virus. They spread misinformation [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=407.12s)]
*  about the state of the economy here in the state of Florida. We just lost a $2 billion investment [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  and more than 2,000 jobs because he's anti-business. He attacks and harasses businesses that are against [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=418.08s)]
*  his ideology. And we have an affordability crisis. Our families are suffering an affordability crisis, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=424.64s)]
*  and he's done nothing. He is pushing a MAGA agenda and attacking the freedoms of our [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Floridians all over the state. It's so interesting, Debbie, because what you just said, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=436.72s)]
*  some of that, is literally in the bill of particulars that Trump has used against DeSantis. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=441.12s)]
*  And again, they're probably—those folks are probably not going to hear it here. They're not [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=445.36s)]
*  going to hear it from you. But again, Trump has proven a feral instinct for the political rhetoric [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=447.92s)]
*  and particularly weakness of the people he's against him, particularly in a Republican primary. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  And I just think that, like, there is going to be a little bit of talking past each other as things [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=461.44000000000005s)]
*  are set up right now. What do you think? Well, let me just also mention that the Trump campaign [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=465.76s)]
*  right now has the former DeSantis campaign manager, so she knows him very, very well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=472.32s)]
*  And the truth is that Ron DeSantis was in Congress. He was one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=477.36s)]
*  and he supported ending Medicare, cutting Social Security, repealing the Affordable Care Act. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=482.48s)]
*  And so he has every right to attack DeSantis on that. Tim, what do you think? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=487.92s)]
*  Tim Cook This is what people don't remember about the Trump 2016 campaign, right? He was so [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=491.84s)]
*  extreme on certain issues, but he talked about things that your average talk radio call-in base [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=498.08s)]
*  voter cared about. He was willing to go against the dorky national review orthodoxies on conservative [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  issues and talk about things like Social Security. And I just think that DeSantis is working right into [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=509.52s)]
*  the same trap that Ted Cruz had on him. Tim Cook [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. Dorky, neurotic, online obsessives who need to go outside and grill something and touch grass, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=515.28s)]
*  like normal people, and stop obsessing over whatever the heck Target sold. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=521.28s)]
*  Tim Miller And Debbie Mooker-Sopel, thank you very much. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5uBDnuC2A&t=526.24s)]
