# This NY race is history's most expensive House primary. Here’s why.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k)
*  There are six days to go until Election Day in New York, and we already have the most expensive congressional primary in American history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=0.0s)]
*  It's happening in the 16th district where Representative Jamal Bowman faces a challenge from a fellow Democrat, Westchester County Executive George Latimer. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=7.94s)]
*  More than 22 million dollars have been poured into this race. Again, there's a primary between two Democrats in a D-plus-20 district. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=16.3s)]
*  Why all that spending? Where is it coming from? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=24.32s)]
*  Well, this race isn't really about the candidates, at least the spending part of it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=27.48s)]
*  It's more about the shape of politics in the post-Citizens United era. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=31.66s)]
*  Just take a look at this bar chart here. Here are the five top spenders in New York 16, according to the data firm Ad Impact. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Both the candidates are there, as well as some groups you would expect in a liberal Democratic primary. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=44.08s)]
*  The vast majority of all the ad spending in this primary, 14 million dollars is coming from over there on the left from a single super PAC called the United Democracy Project or UDP. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  They are the sole reason this is the most expensive primary ever in American history. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=60.76s)]
*  Now, UDP is a super PAC created and largely funded by the pro-Israel lobby group APAC. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=65.24s)]
*  And it's not surprising that APAC and its associated groups are going after Democrats like Bowman specifically. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=71.08s)]
*  Ever since he gained his seat by knocking off longtime incumbent Elliott Engel back in 2020, Bowman has been aligned with the progressive squad in the House and he has been criticizing the Israeli government calling for a ceasefire in its war with Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=77.36s)]
*  His opponent, George Latimer, basically takes the opposite positions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=90.92s)]
*  He supports Israel's continued war and opposes a ceasefire. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=94.2s)]
*  And you might think, OK, yeah, fair enough. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=98.28s)]
*  That is a very divisive issue among the Democratic electorate in a primary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=100.52s)]
*  That's what primaries are for, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=105.08s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=107.24s)]
*  UDP, the pro-Israel super PAC, didn't drop 14 million dollars of pro-Israel ads on this race. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=108.32s)]
*  In fact, it didn't mention Israel in its ads at all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=115.64s)]
*  Jamal Bowman has his own agenda and refuses to compromise, even with President Biden. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=120.52s)]
*  George Latimer is putting people ahead of personal agendas and delivering real progressive results. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=126.16s)]
*  Apparently, the choice not to mention Israel in any ads was a strategic one on the part of the pro-Israel super PAC funding those ads. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=132.76s)]
*  A UDP spokesman telling Politico last month, we run ads on the issues voters are most focused on, which again is a little odd because like it is sort of a big issue, you'd imagine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=139.48s)]
*  But it seems almost as if the pro-Israel group thinks that pro-Israel ads might not actually play as well as they would hope in a heavily Democratic district like Bowman's. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=150.28s)]
*  So instead, the group that can make unlimited expenditures is using its money to attack Bowman, as you saw in that ad, for being insufficiently loyal to President Biden, his agenda. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=161.88s)]
*  That does play in a heavily Democratic district. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=172.2s)]
*  The irony, as Slate revealed last spring, is that most of UDP's top funders are Republican mega donors, including Bernie Marcus, the former CEO of Home Depot, Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, and Paul Singer, who also famously [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  took Sam Alito on that luxury fishing trip. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=190.76s)]
*  But it gets even weirder. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=194.88s)]
*  OK, if you look back at that bar chart, there's another super PAC there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  That's Fair Shake. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  See that there next to George Latimer in between Jim Lowe Bowman. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=202.64s)]
*  Now, Fair Shake is a super PAC backed by cryptocurrency interests who want to keep crypto lightly regulated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=205.88s)]
*  They are running ads against Bowman too. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  But they are not running ads on crypto. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=216.28s)]
*  They are running ads on, wait for it, Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=218.84s)]
*  This is what Citizens United has wrought. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=224.32s)]
*  Enormous swarms of big money from anodyne sounding groups pounding a candidate while concealing what their own interests are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a bizarre perversion of genuine Democratic discourse that does not serve voters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=235.48s)]
*  But it works great for mega donors. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYtvv3AF7k&t=241.24s)]
