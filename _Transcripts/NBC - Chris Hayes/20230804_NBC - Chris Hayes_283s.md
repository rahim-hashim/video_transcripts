# ‘Banality of evil’: Trump conspirator's path from 'unremarkable' to coup plotter
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE)
*  For this image, remember this one? Pretty hard to forget. Former Trump Justice Department official [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Bossert Clark, in his underwear last year, when the FBI executed a search warrant on his home. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=5.92s)]
*  They seeped a cell phone as part of their sprawling inquiry into Donald Trump's attempts to seal the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=12.56s)]
*  election. Mr. Clark, who we're pretty sure is co-conspirator number four in Trump's indictment, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=16.8s)]
*  played a pivotal role in that scheme. And here in the body cam footage obtained as federal agents [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=23.6s)]
*  searched his home, he looks, well, rather comical and just a bit pathetic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=28.64s)]
*  That entire scene is somewhat indelible because if you look at [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark's bio, anytime before 2020, it would be entirely unremarkable. Went to law school, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=56.72s)]
*  clerked for an appeals court judge after law school, worked at a white collar law firm. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=63.04s)]
*  He headed the Justice Department's Environmental Division during the George W. Bush administration, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=67.12s)]
*  served as an advisor for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. He was a prominent member [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that stocks the judicial branch [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=78.88s)]
*  and conservative judges, as well as Republican administrations. He was, before working for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=82.72s)]
*  Donald J. Trump before 2020, quintessential Republican Washington lawyer. But Jeffrey Clark [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=87.04s)]
*  is also this key figure who wanted to take over the Department of Justice in 2020. And he wanted [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=93.76s)]
*  to throw the weight of the DOJ behind Trump's coup by sending letters to swing states to tell them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=99.76s)]
*  the election was not trustworthy and that the state should send their own electors electing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=106.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. When Justice Department officials, his bosses, wouldn't bend to Trump's will, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=112.72s)]
*  Trump tried to install Clark in a kind of mini coup at the DOJ as the acting attorney general [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=121.12s)]
*  in a bid to remain in power so that Clark could send those letters out and have the DOJ [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  help with the coup. And Clark's starring role in the conspiracy to subvert American democracy is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=131.52s)]
*  detailed in the indictment. Clark's not named, but he sure does match the description of co-conspirator [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=137.12s)]
*  four. When Clark was confronted with the ramifications of trying to steal the election, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  things took a turn according to the indictment. On page 30, federal prosecutors described the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=149.36s)]
*  moment three days before the attempted coup, quote, on the afternoon of January 3rd, when Clark spoke [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=154.56s)]
*  with a deputy White House counsel. He tried to dissuade Clark from assuming the role of acting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=160.24s)]
*  attorney general. The deputy White House counsel reiterated to Clark that there had not been outcome [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=164.96s)]
*  deterrent of fraud in the election, that if Trump remained in office, nonetheless, there would be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  riots in every major city in the United States. Clark responded, well, that's why there's an [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=175.52s)]
*  insurrection act. And that, I submit to you, is the most chilling line in the entire indictment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=180.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark, according to it, wanted to use the U.S. military to use force, their guns, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=186.72s)]
*  bullets in the streets on the American people, so as to install a dictatorship under Donald J. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=192.96s)]
*  Trump, according to prosecutors. To be clear, the Insurrection Act is an 1807 law that allows the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=198.24s)]
*  president to deploy the military to stop an uprising. That's the big culmination of the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=204.4s)]
*  entire conspiracy. That's the fantasy that Jeffrey Clark had. It was what Clark and others wanted [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=209.84s)]
*  Trump to invoke. And when I read that line, the indictment, I thought of Hannah Arendt's infamous [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=216.32s)]
*  line about the banality of evil. As I looked at this middle-aged lawyer in his boxers and his [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=221.28s)]
*  glasses, fantasizing about what those big bad troops would do with their guns, how they would [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=227.6s)]
*  shove a dictatorship down the throats of the American people. You would think the revelations [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=233.68s)]
*  of his role in the conspiracy would have destroyed his career, but in fact, it's been the opposite. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=239.76s)]
*  He has become a celebrated MAGA figure, because the explicit goal of the MAGA movement in action [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=243.76s)]
*  and word is for the Jeffrey Clark vision to come true, to end American democracy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=249.44s)]
*  And it's more than a little troubling how many lifelong Republican lawyers were in on this plot. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJEfTyJhxsE&t=255.51999999999998s)]
