# Elizabeth Warren: GOP extremists are sowing chaos because they think it helps Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI)
*  the parties. Look, for the first two years after Joe Biden was elected, the Democrats were in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=0.0s)]
*  majority in the House and the Senate. And look at what we got done. We got the biggest infrastructure [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=5.84s)]
*  package through in forever. We got the biggest climate package through in the history of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=11.6s)]
*  world. We got a 15 percent minimum corporate tax. We got through $35 insulin. We got a cap [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=18.56s)]
*  on what seniors are going to spend on their prescription drugs. We got through [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=26.24s)]
*  getting rid of junk fees. Many of the junk fees out there, we made a good, good start on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=32.48s)]
*  getting rid of student loan debt for over three million people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=38.64s)]
*  Stuff that's about the business of governing and trying to make government work better for people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=42.96s)]
*  Now the Republicans have been in control of just one house in government. And in that year and a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=48.64s)]
*  half, what have they gotten done? Well, they nearly pushed us over the cliff on not raising [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=55.36s)]
*  the debt ceiling and they nearly shut down the government because they couldn't fund it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=62.24s)]
*  In other words, Democrats are here to try to govern, to try to make Congress work for people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  And the Republican extremists are just here to cause as much chaos, as much pain, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=74.4s)]
*  as humanly possible because they think it's going to help Donald Trump get reelected. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=81.28s)]
*  You know, you talked about that sort of Democratic trifecta with Biden and both houses. The last time [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=85.76s)]
*  there was one, of course, the very busy years of the coming out of the Great Recession, 2009, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  2010. One of the signature pieces of legislation then was the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=95.28s)]
*  huge sprawling piece of legislation and contained within it was a new agency that was the brainchild [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=101.92s)]
*  of a law professor named Elizabeth Warren, who was writing about financial regulation and had a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=106.88s)]
*  famous line saying, you know, if you sold mortgages that blew up as much as these mortgages, if you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=112.72s)]
*  sold them as toasters, you wouldn't be allowed to put them on the shelves because we have a consumer [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=117.28s)]
*  product safety commission that says if the toaster blows up, you can't sell it. And that brainchild, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  a consumer product safety commission for finance, for financial regulations, consumer financial [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=126.64s)]
*  protection board became reality. It is now a reality and has been for years. Today, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  a bunch of payday lenders were before the Supreme Court of the United States [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=137.44s)]
*  trying to get rid of it, trying to destroy it by saying it is unconstitutional to have the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau that gets its funding, you know, authorized by Congress, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=147.28s)]
*  but through the Federal Reserve. I know this is incredibly near and dear to you. What did you make [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=151.44s)]
*  of today's argument? Well, partly they're still coming after this agency because it works. It has [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=156.4s)]
*  shut down the scams. It's forced the big financial institutions to return more than $17 billion to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=163.44s)]
*  people that were cheated by those institutions. The agency is handling about 3000 complaints a day. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=172.0s)]
*  And so the payday industry, remember, these are the guys who make their profits by praying, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=180.56s)]
*  for example, on young service members with loans that run as high as 400% interest. They have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  sued the agency and lost, sued the agency and lost, sued the agency and lost. And now this is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  their Hail Mary. They claim that the agency is unconstitutional because it's not funded [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=202.64s)]
*  through appropriations. And they say that's no good. Here's the problem, though, with that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=208.8s)]
*  It also turns out that the Federal Reserve Bank is not funded through appropriations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Neither is the FDIC. Neither is the OCC. In fact, no banking regulator in the history of banking [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  regulators in the United States has ever been funded through appropriations. And it gets worse [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  than that. Turns out Social Security's not funded through appropriations. Medicare's not funded [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=234.24s)]
*  through appropriations. And that was where the Supreme Court went today. The payday lenders said, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=240.8s)]
*  sink the CFPB. And everybody else in the room was asking, but if you sink the CFPB, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  are you going to sink the whole damned economy? And the answer to that question is, yeah, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=257.44s)]
*  that's the risk you run. And that's what today's debate was all about. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=263.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's like, I understand why you loan sharks may not like an agency that regulates [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=267.68s)]
*  things like interest, but like, are we going to mess around and declare the Federal Reserve [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=273.28s)]
*  unconstitutional, which seems dangerous? Like, it just seems like they are treading in very, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=277.2s)]
*  very dangerous waters with this argument, which at least had enough of a sympathetic hearing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=281.28s)]
*  that it got up to the court. But the questions in oral arguments today seem pretty skeptical. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=285.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But you know, part of what helped that along, I just want to give a little shout out here, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  the mortgage bankers, the home builders, folks who actually were involved in the crash back in 2008. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=297.12s)]
*  And by the way, Chris, did you remember that today is an anniversary? Exactly 15 years ago today, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  Congress had to pass a $700 billion bailout to be able to make that money available so that our [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=313.6s)]
*  banking system didn't implode. So what has been the big thank you from those giant banks? It's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=321.92s)]
*  been to keep lobbying to try to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so that they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=329.44s)]
*  could continue to run more and more of these frauds. And today, what people were pushing on [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=335.6s)]
*  the Supreme Court was to say, if you decide that this funding mechanism for the CFPB is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=342.56s)]
*  unconstitutional, you really run the risk of blowing up the whole system. That's when I said, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=350.24s)]
*  even the mortgage brokers said, don't do this. This is dangerous. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=355.92s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you so much for your time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=359.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GceaeWoMI&t=372.56s)]
