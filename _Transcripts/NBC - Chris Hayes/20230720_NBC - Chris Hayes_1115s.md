# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk)
*  You can reasonably disagree with how our government executes the responsibilities we have given it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=0.0s)]
*  But that is very different from saying we're no longer going to allow our political opponents to participate in the process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=6.0s)]
*  That is the Trump model. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=13.0s)]
*  We're going to participate in elections the way we always have, until the way we've always done things stops working for me, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=15.0s)]
*  and then we're going to change the rules to stay in power. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=21.0s)]
*  It's the exact same playbook that autocrats have been using to try and end free and fair elections throughout human history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=24.0s)]
*  Very few issues in life are actually black or white binary, but this one actually is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=30.0s)]
*  Either you are a supporter of free and fair elections and representative democracy, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=36.0s)]
*  and you think that Donald Trump's attempts to end those things was a grave, dangerous crime that cannot go unpunished, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=40.0s)]
*  or you simply do not really believe in democracy after all. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=47.0s)]
*  Which is why we need to call out the elected Republicans who are tying themselves into knots to defend Trump's indefensible conduct. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=51.0s)]
*  It's absolutely anti-democratic, and there's absolutely no reason to do it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=59.0s)]
*  You simply don't have to support Donald Trump on this one. It's the wrong thing to do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=64.0s)]
*  When you say what Trump did wasn't really that bad or call the whole process a witch hunt, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=68.0s)]
*  you're tacitly supporting the attempted theft of democracy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=73.0s)]
*  Every person living in this country is protected from tyranny only by our shared belief and support of our democratic institutions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=77.0s)]
*  Your ability to have a say in the way your government is run only exists when the political system actually functions the way it is supposed to. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=86.0s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to undo that. So the threat is existential at this point. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=94.0s)]
*  It does not matter if you care more about abortion or inflation or crime or the climate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=100.0s)]
*  You lose your say in how we collectively tackle any of those issues when you lose your say in the democratic process. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=106.0s)]
*  And by defending Donald Trump in this particular circumstance, that is what a whole bunch of people are signaling that they're on board with. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=114.0s)]
*  That's why this has to be sorted out now in a court of law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=122.0s)]
*  Because if we lose this fight, there may never be another chance to try again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=126.0s)]
*  I know that sounds hyperbolic, but it's true. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=130.0s)]
*  American democracy itself is actually at stake in a way it reminds me of the now iconic closing argument that Congressman Adam Schiff made during the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=133.0s)]
*  If right doesn't matter, we're lost. If the truth doesn't matter, we're lost. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=145.0s)]
*  Framers couldn't protect us from ourselves if right and truth don't matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=155.0s)]
*  Here right is supposed to matter. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=161.0s)]
*  It's what's made us the greatest nation on earth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=166.0s)]
*  No constitution can protect us. Right doesn't matter anymore. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=171.0s)]
*  And you know, you can't trust this president do what's right for this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=176.0s)]
*  You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=185.0s)]
*  Congressman Adam Schiff is a Democrat of California. He was the lead impeachment manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=191.0s)]
*  As you just heard, he sat on the January 6 committee. He currently is a candidate for the United States Senate, and he joins me now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=197.0s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you this evening. Thank you for being with us. I want to go back to that speech that you made. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=203.0s)]
*  Here right matters is also the title of Alexander Vindman's book. Vindman, of course, kicked off the whole impeachment by reporting the phone call to Volodymyr Zelensky, the extortionate phone call. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=209.0s)]
*  And he used the term in his testimony because he was trying to reassure his father, who had come from Ukraine and earlier from Russia, that that's okay, Dad. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=219.0s)]
*  Don't worry about me because I'm here in America where right counts for something. Right matters. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=229.0s)]
*  His whole point was in America, they make a distinction between right and wrong. He was saying that that's what our democracy is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=234.0s)]
*  But what Donald Trump is saying is that's not really true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=241.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. I use that because it's such a powerful idea. It's really core to who we are as a country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=246.0s)]
*  And sadly, and you're so right to point this out, what has allowed Donald Trump to put our democracy on such fragile ground to tear down and tear out so many of our institutions is the willing enablers in the U.S. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=254.0s)]
*  Congress. The people like Kevin McCarthy, who were saying this is all about Donald Trump's position in the polls, it has nothing to do with justice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=269.0s)]
*  Every time you hear one of the public leaders say things like that, which they know to be false, they're basically saying right doesn't matter in this country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=277.0s)]
*  What's lawful doesn't matter in this country. The only thing that matters is obtaining power and keeping power. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=285.0s)]
*  You know, I think we are where we are because people haven't given meaning to their oath of office. They haven't informed that oath with ideas of right and wrong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=292.0s)]
*  They're unwilling to accept the basic truth or even that there is something called fact for the Republican leadership. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=301.0s)]
*  It's just about power. You sat on the January 6th committee as well, which recommended that Donald Trump and others be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=307.0s)]
*  That is now what we believe to be in that target letter. The idea that that that charge may exist. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=316.0s)]
*  What do you make of that? Why is that important? What is this conspiracy to defraud the United States about? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=322.0s)]
*  Well, it's about conspiring with others to deprive them of their vote to perpetrate a fraud on the country that the person who actually lost the election somehow should be declared the winner. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=330.0s)]
*  And I was very interested to see also reporting that they are going after the videotape in state at the State Farm Arena in Georgia. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=341.0s)]
*  That will be relevant to prosecutors looking into that phone call of Donald Trump, where he's badgering the top elections officials to find 11,780 votes that don't exist. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=351.0s)]
*  If the president is involved in trying to defraud voters in Georgia and as George is a swing state, defraud voters all over the United States of America, that's obviously a very serious crime. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=362.0s)]
*  And I'm glad that the special counsel is, you know, moving on these issues. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=375.0s)]
*  It took them a long time at the Justice Department to get started on anybody but those who broke into the Capitol that day. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=380.0s)]
*  But it does seem like the investigation is coming to its conclusion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=387.0s)]
*  And I have to hope that the former president and others will be held responsible. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=391.0s)]
*  Now, one of the things that your committee recommended were charges of aiding and insurrection. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=396.0s)]
*  Our reporting at the moment does not indicate that that's being included. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=401.0s)]
*  Tell me what your thoughts are on that being left out of these these potential charges. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=405.0s)]
*  Well, I think certainly the former president's involvement in inciting that attack on the Capitol, a powerful evidence, such as on January 6th, when he's told that there's a problem with the metal detectors, but it's not the usual problem. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=411.0s)]
*  The problem on January 6th wasn't that there were long lines that the metal detectors. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=425.0s)]
*  It was that there were practically no lines because people wouldn't go through them because they didn't want their weapons taken away. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=429.0s)]
*  And what is Donald Trump's response? Then take down the effing mags. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=436.0s)]
*  They're not here to hurt him. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=441.0s)]
*  And, you know, this is powerful evidence of his involvement in the incitement, his knowledge that these people are armed in dangers and the failure to do anything during the incitement. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=443.0s)]
*  You know, the statute also prevents giving aid and comfort to people who commit insurrection. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=454.0s)]
*  So we thought there were there was certainly a strong body of evidence that the department should consider. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=459.0s)]
*  But, you know, having been a federal prosecutor myself, they're going to look for what is the most provable, strongest case. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=464.0s)]
*  And he's been very conservative in the charging in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=472.0s)]
*  I think he'll be conservative in the charging around January 6th if indeed he brings charges against the former president. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=476.0s)]
*  So the conspiracy part of defrauding the United States government, that's important because that's the that's what the government's role was. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=483.0s)]
*  There's another charge in there. The deprivation of rights under the color of law. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=490.0s)]
*  It's not something that will be familiar to a lot of people, but this has to do with the idea of actually undermining the vote. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=495.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=503.0s)]
*  And it could be very much the flip side of the conspiracy to defraud. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=504.0s)]
*  That is, if you deprive a person of their vote and you could defraud deprive a person of their vote by saying their vote shouldn't be counted. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=507.0s)]
*  The president was obviously trying to stop the counting after Election Day because he knew the absentee ballots would run against him. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=516.0s)]
*  But also trying to get state elections officials to count votes that didn't exist also has the effect of undermining the real votes of the American people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=522.0s)]
*  And so it does injury to voters. That could be the the prosecution's theory or it could be, you know, the president's actions in threatening the lives of elections officials, depriving them of their right to do their jobs as poll workers, as elections officials, you know, unmolested and without the fear of death. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=534.0s)]
*  So there are a number of ways I think that the facts could support such a charge. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=556.0s)]
*  But we will have to wait and see, indeed, whether there are charges and if this particular statute is used. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah. And again, we don't know. We this is some reporting we've got, but we don't know until we see that target letter. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=567.0s)]
*  What's your sense of whether or not these charges as they are being discussed right now, these potential charges reflect the gravity of what Donald Trump did? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=572.0s)]
*  You made the point that Jack Smith might be conservative about this because he needs a case to actually prove and hopefully one that doesn't drag into 2025. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=580.0s)]
*  Does it reflect for the for the viewer, for the American public, the gravity of what Donald Trump did? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=588.0s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope that whatever charges are brought does reflect the gravity. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=596.0s)]
*  But I also completely agree with you, Ali, that this is this is the most serious set of potential charges. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=600.0s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago is very serious. It threatened the nation's security. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=608.0s)]
*  The charges in New York are also serious, committing multiple acts of business fraud is no laughing matter. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=611.0s)]
*  But here you're talking about charges going to the heart of our democracy, charges involving the first effort to essentially prevent the peaceful transfer power in our history. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=618.0s)]
*  So any charges regarding January 6, I think by definition are going to be the most serious charges against Donald Trump. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=630.0s)]
*  Good to see you. Thanks again for being with us tonight. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=638.0s)]
*  The Congressman Adam Schiff of California. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=640.0s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to steal our democracy and he's still trying to do it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=643.0s)]
*  For those who do not understand the ramifications of all this, let me paint a picture of what could happen next. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=646.0s)]
*  Let's say Trump does not get prosecuted for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election or the prosecution and the trial get delayed beyond 2024, beyond the election, and he becomes president again. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=652.0s)]
*  Then what happens? Well, there's no real need to guess. He's already telling us. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=662.0s)]
*  When I get back into the Oval Office, I will totally obliterate the deep state. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=668.0s)]
*  They will be obliterated. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=673.0s)]
*  And we know all the good ones now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=677.0s)]
*  2024 is our final battle. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=679.0s)]
*  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=682.0s)]
*  We will expel the warmongers from our government. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=684.0s)]
*  We will drive out the globalists. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=688.0s)]
*  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, fascists. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=690.0s)]
*  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=694.0s)]
*  Now, these are not empty words. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=699.0s)]
*  The ex-president and his allies have specific plans, as the New York Times reports, for a, quote, sweeping expansion of presidential power, end quote, and, quote, to bring independent agencies under presidential control. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=700.0s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to destroy our democracy, and if he is not prosecuted and reelected, he's likely to try to finish the job. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=714.0s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott is a professor of history at New York University. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=720.0s)]
*  She's the author of Strongmen, Mussolini to the Present. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=723.0s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=726.0s)]
*  Ruth, let's just start with this reporting in the New York Times, that there's actually a plan in motion not just to obliterate the deep state or cleanse it or whatever he says. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=727.0s)]
*  It's to actually expand presidential power. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=737.0s)]
*  Now, again, you're an historian. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=740.0s)]
*  You've seen that when we move from democracy to autocracy around the world and throughout history, this is part of the playbook. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=750.0s)]
*  In fact, the essence of authoritarianism is the executive branch that becomes so powerful that it overwhelms the judiciary representation and takes away independence. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=751.0s)]
*  So I looked at that reporting. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=762.0s)]
*  It was quite chilling to hear Trump's former director of the Office of Management and Budget say, we're looking for pockets of independence to seize them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=764.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=775.0s)]
*  So what he's saying is that they're going to obliterate the idea of independent institutions, of neutrality of institutions and agencies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=776.0s)]
*  And using the word seize is very interesting. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=788.0s)]
*  That's not the language of democratic reform. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=791.0s)]
*  That's the language of autocratic takeover. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=793.0s)]
*  Independence. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=796.0s)]
*  I mean, we celebrate Independence Day. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=797.0s)]
*  It's one of our biggest things. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=799.0s)]
*  The concept of independence in government, the concept of the independence of our branches of government. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=800.0s)]
*  This has now become the kind of thing that Donald Trump says we can't have too much of this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=806.0s)]
*  We can't have this independence running around. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=812.0s)]
*  We need my view of the world. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=813.0s)]
*  At some point, why does this not stop in its tracks with those people who are at his rally saying, that's not what I want. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=815.0s)]
*  I don't want you to trample over independence in America. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=822.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is very different than other politicians. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=825.0s)]
*  He's a cult leader. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=830.0s)]
*  And he set up this narrative, both the narrative of his victimhood, that he's the victim of the deep state and that he's actually protecting them. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=831.0s)]
*  So he set that up. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=840.0s)]
*  He's also set up for many years that the judiciary, the Department of Justice, the press, all of these people are partisan and out to get him. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=842.0s)]
*  And so everything that happens every time he's targeted, they believe this is how conspiracy theory works. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=851.0s)]
*  They believe it's a fulfillment of their worst fears. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=860.0s)]
*  And that's why they're not going anywhere. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=865.0s)]
*  And that's why with each indictment, his popularity either stays the same or rises. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=867.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=873.0s)]
*  And what we've seen is whenever he gets prosecuted and he doesn't like it, he calls the prosecutors' names. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=874.0s)]
*  He calls everybody names. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=879.0s)]
*  It's all a witch hunt. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=880.0s)]
*  And he motivates people against them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=881.0s)]
*  But he didn't do that this weekend. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=883.0s)]
*  He talked about Aileen Cannon, his judge in the Mar-a-Lago case, and what a patriot she is and how we need more like her. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=884.0s)]
*  What was that dog whistle all about? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=891.0s)]
*  I see this knowing how authoritarians use public appearances to levy veiled threats. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=894.0s)]
*  This was a reminder to the judge to stay on track. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=902.0s)]
*  And it was a reminder to all other judges that this is what he expects of them. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=908.0s)]
*  Because what we're talking about here is a reshaping of government so that loyalty is all that matters, not professionalism, not expertise. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=912.0s)]
*  You know, there are people who say, well, yeah, we need a more efficient government, smaller government. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=922.0s)]
*  But that's not what Donald Trump's saying here. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=927.0s)]
*  In fact, he said he's going to be purging the sick political class that hates our nation. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=929.0s)]
*  He's telling us that political attributes are going to be what decides who survives and who has to leave. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=935.0s)]
*  And that's authoritarianism. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=943.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's important to note for conservatives, it's not about small government. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=945.0s)]
*  He's not talking about the size of government. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=948.0s)]
*  He's talking about controlling the various aspects and levers of government. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=950.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=953.0s)]
*  And the end game of all of this is survival of Donald Trump. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=954.0s)]
*  And, you know, authoritarians are not like other leaders. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=958.0s)]
*  Most people would not want to run for office if they're under investigation. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=962.0s)]
*  Well, that's not how these guys roll, right? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=966.0s)]
*  Putin, Trump, Netanyahu, Berlusconi, they all run for office. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=968.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=972.0s)]
*  The goal is to get to power and do autocratic capture of the judiciary especially so that you can become untouchable, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=973.0s)]
*  so that you never have to worry about an indictment and investigation again because you control the government. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=981.0s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=988.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the trial gets delayed or the trial takes too long [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=989.0s)]
*  or that Donald Trump gets elected before the end of the trial or that the trial doesn't happen. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=994.0s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump, you couldn't prosecute when he was president. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=999.0s)]
*  Now he doesn't want you to prosecute him because he's busy running for president. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1002.0s)]
*  Then he won't be prosecutable again because he's president again. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1005.0s)]
*  At some point, this could become very dangerous. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1008.0s)]
*  America in 2025 could be an entirely different place than it is today. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1011.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1015.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1016.0s)]
*  And I think Americans have to, you know, it's very hard because it's always different in every case. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1017.0s)]
*  However, in my book Strongmen, which is 100 years of people going through this, nobody's ever prepared. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1023.0s)]
*  And they think they're going to be the exception. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1030.0s)]
*  And they don't listen to the warning signs until it's too late, which is why you and I talk so much. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1032.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1037.0s)]
*  These are the warning signs. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1038.0s)]
*  We're yelling them from the rooftops. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1040.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1042.0s)]
*  I'm thinking very clear. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1043.0s)]
*  And one of my maxims from studying this stuff is that authoritarians always tell you what they're going to do. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1044.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1049.0s)]
*  As a kind of challenge and as a warning. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1050.0s)]
*  And people don't listen until it's too late. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1054.0s)]
*  There's no particular benefit to thinking that when he becomes president, this will all not happen because we spent four years thinking once he's president, he'll become more presidential. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1056.0s)]
*  He's basically telling you what he's going to do. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1064.0s)]
*  He will be finishing the job that he started. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1066.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's not just destroying democracy internally. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1069.0s)]
*  That is also Donald Trump always had two aims. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1074.0s)]
*  One was domestic. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1078.0s)]
*  The other was to take America out of the realm of democratic internationalism and align it with autocracy. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1079.0s)]
*  And that will happen as well. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1087.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1089.0s)]
*  Well, that happens. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1090.0s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Ghien, I will continue our conversations. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1091.0s)]
*  We will join you from Canada. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1092.0s)]
*  Thanks, Ruth. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1094.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1095.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5bAwTeHhk&t=1099.0s)]
