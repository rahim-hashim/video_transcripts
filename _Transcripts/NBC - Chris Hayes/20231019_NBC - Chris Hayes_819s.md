# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 18
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio is even [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=0.0s)]
*  Further from being speaker of the house than he was yesterday in a second floor vote Jordan ended up with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=5.68s)]
*  199 supporters a net loss from yesterday's tally as Paul Kane of the Washington Post noted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Jordan set a modern record nice work Jim earning the lowest vote tally for a majority's nominee to be speaker [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=19.04s)]
*  Now Jordan did pick up three new supporters today [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=26.16s)]
*  But he lost four members who flipped away from him this time around in total [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=28.96s)]
*  22 Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan and he can only afford to lose four [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=34.2s)]
*  So the congressman from Ohio has a lot of work ahead of him if he's gonna convert enough votes to win the gavel [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Jordan is not giving up tonight. He told reporters the house will vote again tomorrow afternoon [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And we'll keep voting as long as necessary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=52.44s)]
*  Jordan is the plan to vote tomorrow? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=55.92s)]
*  I believe that's right [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=57.92s)]
*  So when do you think we'll vote tomorrow? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=59.92s)]
*  Before we keep bopping to our college like I told you a few moments ago [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=61.92s)]
*  How many counts are you going to do this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=67.92s)]
*  We gotta get a speaker [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=69.92s)]
*  But is it gonna be you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=71.92s)]
*  I believe so yes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=73.92s)]
*  In the meantime the house remains paralyzed on its 15th day without a speaker [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=75.92s)]
*  The longest vacancy of more than half a century and that last gap in 1971 only occurred because congress actually convened rather late in January [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=79.92s)]
*  Of course we are stuck in the current debacle because of the fundamental deepening chaos in the house Republican caucus [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=87.92s)]
*  At this point it really does feel like they are a malfunctioning Roomba vacuum cleaner hopelessly stuck in the corner [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=94.92s)]
*  Ramming into the wall over and over again its sensors gone haywire [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=101.92s)]
*  But they keep going I mean the current path is pretty clearly not working [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=105.92s)]
*  Jim Jordan is 18 votes away from the majority [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=109.92s)]
*  The thing is not exactly a unifying figure [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=112.92s)]
*  He's an extreme far right coup plotter [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=115.92s)]
*  And the politics of voting for someone like that are not going to change in 24 hours for the people that hold out from voting for him and are in vulnerable seats [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=118.92s)]
*  Now the pressure campaign to bully those members into voting for him from Jordan from Donald Trump from Fox News hasn't worked [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=128.92s)]
*  It's failed so far [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=137.92s)]
*  If the Republican party does not want to keep ramming into the wall embarrassingly in front of the entire nation and world over and over and over again [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=139.92s)]
*  They need to change direction [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=147.92s)]
*  They can find someone else to be the nominee for speaker [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=149.92s)]
*  Although choosing a nominee the caucus can get behind obviously easier said than done as we're seeing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=152.92s)]
*  Or they could compromise with Democrats [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=157.92s)]
*  It would only take five Republicans meeting with Democratic leadership to craft some sort of deal and elect minority leader Hakeem Jeffries to the speakership [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=160.92s)]
*  Or if they don't like that which I expect they don't choose someone else even a Republican under some kind of agreed to power sharing pact [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=170.92s)]
*  So far they don't seem willing to do that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=181.92s)]
*  Another option that some people have been floating would be to expand the role of the temporary speaker Patrick McHenry at the moment under the current House rules [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=184.92s)]
*  His powers are essentially ministerial basically limited to gaveling in and out until a permanent speaker is elected [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=194.92s)]
*  But the New York Times reports Republican David Joyce of Ohio has been circulating a bipartisan plan that would give McHenry the power to run the House floor through early January [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=200.92s)]
*  Members of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus made up of center leading members from both parties have also been involved in the talks [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=211.92s)]
*  Two former House speakers interestingly Newt Gingrich and John Boehner endorsed the plan last night [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=219.92s)]
*  Now to be clear first of all no one even knows how this would work precisely to change rules [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=228.92s)]
*  Elevating McHenry would be completely unprecedented as far as anyone can tell [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=234.92s)]
*  It also would not solve the underlying problem of Republican Party set on sawing chaos as Hakeem Jeffries laid out this afternoon after a Democratic caucus meeting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=238.92s)]
*  You talk to me about the point of this caucus meeting is it just to take the temperature on McHenry [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=248.92s)]
*  There are two things that were important for us to accomplish this week [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=254.92s)]
*  First stop Jim Jordan who is a clear and present danger to our democracy and the poster child for Republican extremism [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  The second is to reopen the House so we can do the business of the American people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  And our preference is to reopen the House in a bipartisan way so we can govern in an enlightened way moving forward [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=276.92s)]
*  Does that mean McHenry is a path [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=285.92s)]
*  This conversation will not be about any one individual because we're concerned about two things the institution of the Congress and the best interests of the American people [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=288.92s)]
*  I know I got to say the Patrick McHenry plan speaks so perfectly to the trajectory of the Republican Party [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=299.92s)]
*  Back in 2005 McHenry was a freshman congressman he was a firebrand one of the furthest right members of the party [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=305.92s)]
*  He was profiled in magazines as such 18 years later McHenry is being floated as the institutional savior to rescue the Republicans from their latest iteration of hard right rebels [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=313.92s)]
*  And this time around that faction is so dangerous to American democracy and so strong within the Republican Party they are threatening to bring the entire institution down on their own heads [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=326.92s)]
*  We are connected through humanity and before Wadi was Palestinian, American or a Muslim he was a human [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=340.92s)]
*  We must rise higher than those people who propagate hatred [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=350.92s)]
*  Our voices must be louder and more powerful and together we must strive towards the fundamental American principles of dignity, respect and inclusion for all [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=358.92s)]
*  Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil last night in Plainfield, Illinois to mourn the murder of a six-year-old child killed prosecutors say because he was Palestinian-American [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=374.92s)]
*  A 71-year-old man is now in custody. His wife told police that he, quote, listens to conservative talk radio on a regular basis and has been heavily interested in the events that have recently occurred in Israel [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=384.92s)]
*  Court documents say that Saturday morning he confronted his tenant, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, berating her over, quote, what was going on in Jerusalem [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=395.92s)]
*  He then attacked her with a knife, injuring her, murdering her son, stabbing the boy 26 times [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=403.92s)]
*  Tensions are high across the country right now with sickening echoes of the months following 9-11 [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=409.92s)]
*  A Department of Homeland Security official tells NBC News it is monitoring a, quote, heightened threat environment that the intensity has gotten worse [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=415.92s)]
*  The NYPD said it is on high alert, ordering officers to report in full uniform for the rest of this week [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=422.92s)]
*  In southern Brooklyn last Wednesday, police say a group of attacked three young men as they ate takeout food, shouting F Islam and F Palestine at the victims [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=428.92s)]
*  Just a few miles away, that same day, two teens were taken into custody accused of pointing imitation firearms at a Brooklyn synagogue [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=437.92s)]
*  Elsewhere in New York, police are searching for a man accused of attacking a Sikh teenager on a bus and trying to remove his turban [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=445.92s)]
*  While in Ohio, a man was arrested for making anti-Semitic remarks to homeowners with Israeli flags on their lawns [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=452.92s)]
*  And in San Francisco, anti-Semitic messages were left on windows along Market Street [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=459.92s)]
*  In these times of stress and fear, it is, of course, vitally important to remember the real test of any society is to have no tolerance for hatred of any kind and any form [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=464.92s)]
*  Especially, as my next guest points out, considering that hatred and rage and violence was exactly what Hamas wanted to provoke with the atrocity it carried out in Israel [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=474.92s)]
*  That's next [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=485.92s)]
*  Congressman Pete Aguilar is a Democrat of California. He served on the January 6th Committee. He is now chair of the House Democratic Caucus in leadership and he joins me now [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=489.92s)]
*  Congressman, I know that you, obviously, folks on the Democratic side are not being, you know, you're not part of the plan here [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=498.92s)]
*  This is a sort of partisan affair or has been up until now. Do you have an understanding of what tomorrow will bring? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=503.92s)]
*  Well, I'm learning from Ryan Nobles there, too. We know what has been made public, which is we may have votes tomorrow [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=511.92s)]
*  And that Jim Jordan is dead set on making his colleagues vote. And just as the reporting has mentioned, and we're, you know, we're feet from the House chamber right now and he keeps losing votes [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=519.92s)]
*  He cannot count to 217. And so we are in this position in this holding pattern because Jim Jordan is the most extreme member on that side of the aisle [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=532.92s)]
*  He is the leader of the Insurrection Caucus over there. And it's just terribly unfortunate that this is the position that we're in and that Republicans have elevated [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=545.92s)]
*  And I just think it says a lot about the group that 199 of them still say, yeah, that's our guy [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=555.92s)]
*  You have made, you've made overtures about some sort of bipartisan resolution. Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader, has [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=562.92s)]
*  But I can't tell if this is like rhetoric where you're saying, well, it would be nice or is there any active conversation plan back channels happening right now with any Republican members about some bipartisan resolution to this? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=568.92s)]
*  There are always active conversations with members on the other side of the aisle after 15 days without a speaker [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=584.92s)]
*  I would hope that there are conversations happening and I know that they are. And so, you know, our hope is leader Jeffries laid out. Our first primary responsibility this week was to make sure the head of the MAGA circus, Jim Jordan, didn't become speaker [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=590.92s)]
*  Our second objective is to make sure we open up the people's house. So we are having conversations, private conversations with our colleagues to make sure that that happens [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=606.92s)]
*  We they control the votes here. And so it's up to them to see what the path forward looks like. But this is more than just, you know, empty rhetoric and talking points [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=617.92s)]
*  This is a real desire to want to make this place function, make the Congress, make the house function again and to make sure that we are carrying on the people's business because we have such urgent priorities to do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=628.92s)]
*  We have to make sure we avoid government shutdown. We have to make sure we're providing aid to Israel and Ukraine. Those are the things that, by the way, have 300 votes plus in Congress. Let's just make sure that we have an opportunity to deliver for the American public [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=643.92s)]
*  Yesterday or the day before, I think it was yesterday, Hakeem Jeffries explicitly referenced the current Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry as someone that he respected, that Democrats respect. There is clearly some plan being circulated to extend the powers of the Speaker Pro Tem, you know, through the end of January to basically run the house like the Speaker. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=659.92s)]
*  It was interesting to me that both Newt Gingrich and John Boehner endorse that plan now that they have any say in it either way. What do you make of that plan? What do you think of it? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=683.92s)]
*  Well, this isn't just about one person. I think a lot of us have respect for Patrick McHenry and how he's trying to conduct himself and organize this election. That can't be an easy job that he was elevated to. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=693.92s)]
*  But, you know, our primary responsibility is to make sure that the House functions. So it's not about one person. We will wait to see if a Republican introduces a resolution to do that. I've read the public reporting that you have as well, but the details matter for House Democrats. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=705.92s)]
*  The language of these policies and proposals matter, and so we'll see what it says. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=724.92s)]
*  Can I ask, this is like super in the weeds, and you may not know, and I don't know if anyone knows, but how does that even work under the rules? Like, are the rules at every recess you come back and vote for Speaker? Can someone introduce a resolution? Like, I don't even actually understand procedurally this liminal space in which you currently exist. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=729.92s)]
*  Sure, potentially this could be right now the highest order of business is electing a Speaker. And so someone could offer a privileged resolution to move to an election, just like Elise Stefanik has done to have the Republicans nominate Jim Jordan again. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=748.92s)]
*  Or someone else could offer a resolution that does this. And there is precedent for it. There used to be a Speaker pro tem designated at times when the Speaker was out of session for a week or month. It hasn't been done since the 90s. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=766.92s)]
*  But that individual would function just as the Speaker does for a limited time period until the Speaker came back from vacation. And this is precedent from years ago. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=783.92s)]
*  Alright Congressman Pete Aguilar, thank you very much. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=793.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_R0TwEv9g&t=796.92s)]
