# Hayes: What the Republican debt ceiling threat is really about
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA)
*  Tonight, I want to talk about something a little different, because not enough people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=0.0s)]
*  are talking about why this is all happening in the first place. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=4.12s)]
*  And I mean, like, really, let's just go down to fundamentals. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=8.1s)]
*  We're watching the story. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=10.44s)]
*  Maybe you've seen it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=11.9s)]
*  What is this about? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=13.52s)]
*  Why are we having a debt ceiling showdown? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=16.0s)]
*  Why are Republicans threatening to tank the global economy and default for the first time [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=19.48s)]
*  in this country's history unless they get their way to impose austerity and cut federal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=23.14s)]
*  spending on those programs severely? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=29.2s)]
*  Now the stated justification for the hostage taking, you hear it everywhere, doesn't make [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=32.84s)]
*  any sense. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=38.4s)]
*  And this is really the key to understanding this whole thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=39.4s)]
*  The sort of top line answer, which again has been taken for granted as the answer in most [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=41.56s)]
*  mainstream coverage, is that Republicans want to cut spending. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=46.24s)]
*  And they want to cut spending because they have an ideological commitment to cutting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=50.6s)]
*  spending. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=53.84s)]
*  You see that everywhere. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=55.68s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy says it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=56.76s)]
*  The reporters, by and large, are reporting on him, tend to sort of go along with that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=58.12s)]
*  That's the fight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=61.76s)]
*  It is simply not true. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=62.76s)]
*  It is maddening to see it repeated because it cannot possibly be the actual answer. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=66.24s)]
*  And this isn't speculation or mind reading on my part. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=73.28s)]
*  These are just the facts, the history. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=76.16s)]
*  This is an empirical situation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=78.2s)]
*  We know that cannot be the answer because we have seen what the Republican Party does [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=80.08s)]
*  when it has control of the government and is free to pursue its agenda. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  When Republicans control both houses of Congress and the presidency. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=90.0s)]
*  You were alive for this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=93.4s)]
*  I was too. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  We were all here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  We saw it all happen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, they cut taxes for corporations and rich people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  And they do that every time without fail. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=102.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=104.88s)]
*  And that's because the Republican Party really does believe in that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=105.88s)]
*  They really do believe in cutting taxes for corporations and rich people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=109.76s)]
*  They really do use their power to make it happen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=112.68s)]
*  It's the one piece of legislation they'll manage to get passed even when they're screwing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  up left and right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=119.0s)]
*  Didn't George W. Bush, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=120.0s)]
*  Didn't John. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  They push deregulation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  They make life harder for undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=125.84s)]
*  They restricted illegal immigration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=128.88s)]
*  Sometimes they pick cultural fights. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=131.24s)]
*  They tend to boost spending for defense. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=133.76s)]
*  But one thing they do not do when they have unified control of the federal government [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=135.9s)]
*  is reduce spending. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=141.12s)]
*  Again, this is just a historical fact. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=143.52s)]
*  I'm not doing any mind reading. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=146.28s)]
*  I'm just telling you the simple fact of the matter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  When they have control of the government, they do the opposite of reducing spending. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=150.84s)]
*  They increase spending when their party is in power, when they control the White House. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=155.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think because in the main, government spending is popular and tends to boost the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=161.72000000000003s)]
*  political fortunes of the White House and the president. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=167.44s)]
*  In this case, a Republican president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  It helps the Republican president get reelected. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=172.96s)]
*  Axios put together this handy chart of government spending. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  The purple line is defense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  The brown line is everything else. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=180.36s)]
*  You can see it there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=181.84s)]
*  Spending goes up during the administration of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=182.84s)]
*  And then it slows down a little bit. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  See that little flat line during the Clinton years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=188.24s)]
*  OK, again, that's when Bill Clinton was a president. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=190.68s)]
*  And then after the House got taken over by Newt Gingrich, right, Republicans had a big [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  budget standoff and they imposed spending cuts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=198.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=201.72s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=202.84s)]
*  Well, then spending skyrockets under George W. Bush. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=203.84s)]
*  OK, see, see how that line goes up? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=207.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=209.6s)]
*  Again, George W. Bush takes office. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=210.6s)]
*  He's got a House and Senate, right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=212.2s)]
*  Republicans, they forced the country into two very pointless, very expensive wars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=214.64s)]
*  They also ran up a lot of domestic spending. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=218.56s)]
*  And then what happens after that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=221.3s)]
*  Oh, look, it drops again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=222.6s)]
*  Pretty dramatically under the Democratic president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=225.56s)]
*  And see the dip around 2011 there? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=228.32s)]
*  That's the last time that Republicans were in opposition and held the House and held [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=231.64s)]
*  the debt ceiling hostage. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  The exact same playbook as right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=237.38s)]
*  They demanded Democrats agreed to painful unpopular spending cuts or else Republicans [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  would crater the economy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=245.16s)]
*  So again, Republicans in power, spent, spent, spent for decades while they had the presidency, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=247.76s)]
*  turned around, pretended to care about curbing spending once Democrats are in power. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  Bill Clinton, certainly Barack Obama. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=256.96s)]
*  And again, why? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=259.68s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=260.8s)]
*  Why are they not consistent? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=261.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=262.8s)]
*  The answer is very simple and straightforward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=263.8s)]
*  They wanted to make it harder for Barack Obama to get reelected. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=265.92s)]
*  Here's Mitch McConnell just days after Republicans retook Congress in 2010. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  Over the past week, some have said it was indelicate of me to suggest that our top political [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=276.92s)]
*  priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=283.68s)]
*  But the fact is, if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=291.64s)]
*  spending bill, to end the bailouts, cut spending, and shrink the size and scope of government, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=294.64s)]
*  the only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=301.68s)]
*  veto any of these things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  But they don't want to shrink the size and scope of government. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=306.52s)]
*  They just had control of the government under George O. U. Bush and they did not shrink [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=308.88s)]
*  its scope or its size. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=312.24s)]
*  Again, you can't take what they're saying at face value because it makes no sense. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=314.04s)]
*  Obama was forced to strike a deal to get the debt ceiling raised, which pushed austerity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=320.8s)]
*  measures that appreciably slowed the recovery from the financial crisis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=324.16s)]
*  It made the economy worse. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=328.36s)]
*  It created unnecessary misery for millions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=329.74s)]
*  It also made it worse than it should have been when he was running for a second term [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=333.42s)]
*  in 2012. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=337.68s)]
*  You can see it right here on this chart. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  The top line is how much the government was projected to spend during the Obama years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=341.6s)]
*  The bottom line is how much the government actually spent after the Tea Party forced [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  Democrats to cut spending. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  See how the bottom line, the amount the country has spent is way lower than what originally [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  was projected before Republicans demanded cuts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=355.16s)]
*  But then you'll see something else. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  See how it kind of bows up there, starts to go up? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=359.68s)]
*  It looks like the bottom line starts to tick up around. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=362.3s)]
*  Drum roll please. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=365.04s)]
*  When could it be? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=366.04s)]
*  Ah yes, 27. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=367.04s)]
*  2017. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=369.04s)]
*  Right after Donald Trump was elected and Republicans controlled Congress. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  They started spending, of course. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  Let's go back to the first chart for a second and look at government spending under Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=377.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, it skyrocketed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=381.0s)]
*  Look at the line shoot up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=383.72s)]
*  Non-military spending in particular went way up under Trump than Republicans. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=385.88s)]
*  In fact, Republicans spent so much, partnered with massive cash cuts to the rich and corporations, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=389.04s)]
*  the deficit increased nearly 40% under Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=395.0s)]
*  Now again, I'm belaboring this a little bit, but I just, I can't bear it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=404.72s)]
*  I think at this point everyone sort of agrees Republicans don't actually care about the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  federal deficit. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  That was the old excuse and no one buys it anymore. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Clearly they don't. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=413.32s)]
*  You can't care about the deficit while you're also pushing massive tax cuts to the rich, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=414.32s)]
*  untenable. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=418.48s)]
*  But people still haven't really come around to the even more basic idea that Republicans, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=419.8s)]
*  they don't care about spending either the size and scope of government. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=423.92s)]
*  But that's what the numbers say. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=429.32s)]
*  Again, this is just, I'm just reading you the history. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  So then the question becomes, this is a little bit of a mystery. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=434.84s)]
*  Well, not really a big one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=437.11999999999995s)]
*  But the question is, if Republicans don't care about spending, which they don't, then [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=438.52s)]
*  why are they forcing a crisis over the debt ceiling? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  What's it really all about? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  And again, the answer is very simple. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  It is about asserting dominance over the Democratic president and hurting his political [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=448.84s)]
*  fortunes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=454.28s)]
*  I know that sounds cynical, but there is literally no other way to interpret the remarkably [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=457.0s)]
*  consistent position Republicans take about these matters of spending. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=462.92s)]
*  President Biden himself acknowledged as much over the weekend. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=466.92s)]
*  I think there are some mega Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=471.48s)]
*  do to the economy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=479.6s)]
*  And because I am president and presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=482.04s)]
*  take the blame. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's the one way to make sure Biden's not reelected. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  Look at it this way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  Republicans recognize high degrees of spending under a president tend to be politically popular. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=492.48s)]
*  In fact, Mitch McConnell admitted as much back in 2019. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=496.48s)]
*  Everyone else has forgotten this quote, but I have not. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  This is tattooed in my brain because back in 2019, the Washington Post reported, quote, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=502.66s)]
*  Mitch McConnell told President Trump privately that no politician has ever lost an election [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=506.72s)]
*  for spending more money. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=510.88s)]
*  Inverse is also true. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=514.36s)]
*  Lowering the amount of government spending tends to hurt the economy, hurt American voters, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=516.44s)]
*  tends to be politically unpopular. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=520.04s)]
*  So again, the Republican calculus is simple. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=522.5999999999999s)]
*  You spend like there's no tomorrow when you're in power because it helps you politically. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  When you're out of power, you do everything possible to stop Democrats from spending in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=528.28s)]
*  order to hurt them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  And it just so happens Republicans have some pretty great leverage in these negotiations [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=534.52s)]
*  by again, threatening to blow up the world economy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=537.64s)]
*  The current MAGA Republican Party is completely untethered from any unifying vision of the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=542.88s)]
*  social contract, particularly on matters of political economy where they're all over [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=547.16s)]
*  the place. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  They don't really know even what they want. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  So they're totally fine taking the economy hostage to get their way. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  They have the leverage because so many of them are political nihilists who don't really [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=556.88s)]
*  believe in anything except their own power. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=560.6s)]
*  And there's a reason why you have this cliche. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=563.3s)]
*  You've heard it all the time, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  Negotiating with terrorists. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=566.8399999999999s)]
*  And the reason people invoke that cliche is you're at an inherent disadvantage negotiating [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=569.16s)]
*  with someone who is going to do something malevolent and destructive, completely unbound [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=572.92s)]
*  by any rules or norms. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=579.06s)]
*  But also if you give into that person and their demands, it then incentivizes them to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=581.12s)]
*  act in the same way in the future. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=585.2199999999999s)]
*  And this is why we're here. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=589.0s)]
*  Barack Obama gave in largely to their demands in 2011. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=590.28s)]
*  And here we are more than a decade later in the exact same position. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=593.42s)]
*  Now I would argue Republicans are even possibly more sociopathic about this stuff than they [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=595.86s)]
*  were during the Tea Party years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  Like do you really think the Republican conference that voted for Donald Trump's coup is going [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=605.62s)]
*  to think twice before blowing up the economy or hurt Joe Biden? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=609.5s)]
*  I frankly don't have a solution here. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=614.26s)]
*  President Biden says he won't sidestep the issue by invoking the constitutional requirement [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  that the government pay its debts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=621.22s)]
*  It's written right there in the 14th Amendment. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  It says the debt shall not be questioned. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=624.16s)]
*  That seems pretty definitive to me. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=626.14s)]
*  And many of them have called to do that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=627.86s)]
*  And the Democrats get some blame here because they did not raise the debt ceiling during [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=631.24s)]
*  the lame duck session after last year's midterms, like many folks, including myself and Senator [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders said they should do. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  We're in this position chiefly because the Republican Party wants more than anything [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  else in the world for Joe Biden to lose and a Republican, most likely the guy who tried [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=647.48s)]
*  to end American democracy to win in 2024. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=652.9s)]
*  But the least we the media can do is accurately describe what's actually happening. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQ4IkhGbTA&t=657.26s)]
