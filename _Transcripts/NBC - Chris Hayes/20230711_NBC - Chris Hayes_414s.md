# 'Every week matters:' Judge Cannon weighs 'monumental' decision in Trump case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, the moment we were all expecting has now arrived. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=0.0s)]
*  In a late night filing Monday, 30 minutes before the deadline, Donald Trump's attorneys formally [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=5.84s)]
*  asked for his trial in the classified documents case to be postponed indefinitely, citing his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=11.6s)]
*  2024 presidential run and his inability to get a fair trial. Trump's team asked Florida District [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=17.68s)]
*  Judge Aileen Cannon to reject the Justice Department's proposed trial start in December. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=24.0s)]
*  His lawyers argued that putting the ex-president on trial this year would be, and I quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=30.48s)]
*  unreasonable, telling, and would result in a miscarriage of justice. Trump's lawyers [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=35.44s)]
*  cried political persecution in their reasoning before the court. Quote, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=40.64s)]
*  The court now presides over a prosecution advanced by the administration of a sitting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=44.24s)]
*  president against his chief political rival, himself a leading candidate for the presidency [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=48.32s)]
*  of the United States. They also asked for the trial to be held after the election to ensure a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=52.8s)]
*  fair jury and fair trial. We are now expecting the Justice Department, Jack Smith's office, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=58.64s)]
*  to respond to that indefinite delay request. In fact, Trump's attorneys and federal prosecutors [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=64.88s)]
*  are actually going to meet face to face one week from today in the first pretrial meeting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=70.0s)]
*  in the case to discuss the classified material. The trial scheduling issue presumably will come up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=75.28s)]
*  But when the sweeping indictment was unsealed last month, remember, Special Counsel Jack Smith made [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=81.92s)]
*  extremely limited remarks, kind of got in and got out. It was the first and only remarks he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=86.08s)]
*  has publicly made about the case, but he did make sure in that small amount of time to stress the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=90.56s)]
*  fact that he would seek a speedy trial both for the public and the accused. It's very important [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=94.4s)]
*  for me to note that the defendants in this case must be presumed innocent until proven guilty [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=101.2s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=108.08s)]
*  this matter consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused. Now the accused, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=115.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is asking to delay that speedy trial, a right he is granted, just like any other criminal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=122.16s)]
*  defendant in this country. He's not just asking to delay it. He's flat out asking to push it off [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=126.64s)]
*  until after the election. Now, let's take a step back here. We knew this was coming, right? You knew [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=131.76s)]
*  it, I knew it, we all knew it. This was always the plan. It was telegraphed over the last few [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=136.8s)]
*  years by Donald Trump and Trump's associates, as we saw in lots of different reporting from different [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=140.72s)]
*  sources. In fact, the New York Times reported last July during the height of the January 6 hearings [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  that Trump had accelerated his planning for office as the pair of federal investigations had [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  intensified. And it was reported last summer that Trump had told associates that the legal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=156.96s)]
*  protections of being president were front of mind for him in his decision to run for the office [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=162.0s)]
*  again. Donald Trump knew there was a good chance of being indicted in the multitude of investigations [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=167.84s)]
*  he faced, and he hoped that declaring his candidacy would be able to cloak him in a shield of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=174.0s)]
*  invincibility of political interference and political persecution. And so he did it. That's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=179.2s)]
*  just what he did. He announced his 2024 run for office on November 15th, 2022, an announcement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=183.84s)]
*  coming nearly two years before the 2024 presidential election. That's early. But the point was to get [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  it in there. I'm now a candidate. You can't touch me. The game plan is clear. It always has been. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=200.08s)]
*  Delay the trial, trials, who knows how many, win the election, dismiss the case, stay out of prison. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=205.68s)]
*  An indefinite delay causes harm. Now, the reason I think he really wants to delay it past the 2024 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=212.72s)]
*  election is this idea of no trial. What does that mean? What it means is if Trump becomes president, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=218.32s)]
*  he gets to appoint the new attorney general who could simply dismiss the case altogether. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's the ultimate goal here. You can see that's exactly what's going on last [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  night's filing. I mean, think of it this way. Donald Trump is literally running for his freedom. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=233.04s)]
*  He is running to be president to stay out of prison. Those are the stakes for Donald Trump, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  and he understands them as such. And the key to achieve that end is to delay as much as possible. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=243.28s)]
*  In fact, his team has already tried that in fighting this investigation. Remember last summer, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=249.28s)]
*  after the FBI executed that search warrant on Trump's Florida Beach Club, one of the first things [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=254.4s)]
*  Trump's lawyers didn't respond to was to sue to stop the Justice Department from reviewing the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=259.6s)]
*  documents it had found, their own documents, government documents. Trump argued the search [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=264.8s)]
*  was politically motivated and asked the judge to appoint a third party to review the seized [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  materials. In other words, that was his effort to delay the investigation, keep the FBI from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=274.56s)]
*  looking at the evidence in this cockamamie legal theory. And guess what? It worked for a time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=280.56s)]
*  Trump's motion was granted by the same judge who is now overseeing his criminal trial, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=287.6s)]
*  Judge Aileen Cannon, who herself was appointed by none other than Donald Trump, the defendant. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=292.24s)]
*  She was randomly assigned to the case last month, but back in August, she gave him this completely [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=298.24s)]
*  unprecedented break from normal criminal procedure. Shocking, really. And she agreed to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=303.76s)]
*  appoint a special counsel or a third party to comb through the trove of documents the FBI had [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=308.64s)]
*  discovered at Mar-a-Lago. And it was consequentially delayed the Justice Department's access to some of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  that evidence for a few weeks until an appeals court overturned the decision of Cannon in a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=319.04s)]
*  scathing, absolutely eviscerating ruling. But here's the thing. In this case, especially every [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=325.68s)]
*  week matters, this guy, this twice indicted ex-president, he's got to get to the election. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  It's like a chase movie where he's running from the law. Except what's at stake here is not just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump's prison time, but our own constitutional integrity. Can we actually hold [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=345.12s)]
*  this man, this powerful man accountable as if he were any other citizen? And so here we are. We got [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=350.56s)]
*  16 months on the clock, 16 months away from the 2024 election. Donald Trump has been indicted in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=357.2s)]
*  this case on 37 felony counts. He lucked out and managed to get this same judge who gave him a break [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=363.12s)]
*  last year, acceded to his request for delay. And she now has a monumental decision before her, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=369.2s)]
*  Judge Eileen Cannon. Last time she sided with Trump to the consternation and criticism of just [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=376.08s)]
*  about the entire legal community and the appellate court above her. The question now is, has she [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=381.68s)]
*  learned anything? Will she further collude with Donald Trump's scheme to stay out of prison? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsiMNskQyKM&t=387.28s)]
