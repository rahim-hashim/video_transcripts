# McFaul Putin ‘still has a Wagner problem’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58)
*  16 months ago, Russian forces were on the doorstep of Kiev in Ukraine, believing they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=0.0s)]
*  would take the capital in a matter of days and erase the country from the map as an independent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=12.52s)]
*  Now, what we've seen is Russia having to defend Moscow, its capital, against mercenaries of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=13.52s)]
*  its own making. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=20.56s)]
*  So, in and of itself, that's extraordinary. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=21.56s)]
*  Yesterday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the extraordinary events over the weekend [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=24.92s)]
*  showed what he called cracks emerge in the Russian facade. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=29.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, the American government has been insistent that we and our Western allies had [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=32.96s)]
*  nothing to do with this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=36.96s)]
*  We had to make sure we gave Putin no excuse, may I emphasize, we gave Putin no excuse to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=40.72s)]
*  blame this on the West or to blame this on NATO. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=46.68s)]
*  We made clear that we were not involved. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  We had nothing to do with it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=53.2s)]
*  This was part of a struggle within the Russian system. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=54.84s)]
*  It is an internal Russian matter, but one that the U.S. is following intently, in part [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=60.24s)]
*  because of Ukraine, but also because Russia is a nuclear power with the largest arsenal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  in the world, just under 6,000 nuclear weapons. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=69.18s)]
*  Of course, we're very focused any time there is instability in a major country like Russia, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=73.58000000000001s)]
*  particularly one with nuclear weapons. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=79.28s)]
*  There has been no change in their nuclear posture. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  There's no change in our nuclear posture, but it's something that we're watching very [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=83.56s)]
*  carefully. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=86.88s)]
*  Michael McFaul served as the ambassador to Russia under President Obama. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=87.88s)]
*  He's now professor of political science at Stanford University. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  He's got a new piece in the Journal of Democracy titled Why He May Soon Be Remembered as Putin [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=96.08s)]
*  the Weak. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=102.04s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul joins me now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=103.04s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=104.76s)]
*  We always count on you in these complicated times to try and explain what's going on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=105.76s)]
*  So I want to start now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=110.6s)]
*  I know we've been talking to you a lot over the last few days, but the story continues [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  to emerge and new facts emerge. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  What's your take right now on the aftermath of this armed rebellion for Putin, for Russia, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  for Ukraine? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=123.46s)]
*  Well, the update, I would say, is about Putin's speech tonight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=124.46s)]
*  We were told this was going to be a very, very important speech by Mr. Beskoff. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=131.04s)]
*  And what did he focus on? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=136.12s)]
*  He focused on a central message of trying to divide the Wagner mercenary thugs, soldiers, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=137.7s)]
*  from their commanders. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=144.7s)]
*  Ironically, it was exactly what Prokofiev was trying to do several days ago within the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=145.7s)]
*  Russian military to say, Grossov bad, you guys are good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=150.98s)]
*  That's what Putin was saying. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=155.14s)]
*  You soldiers, you're good. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=156.54s)]
*  You're patriots. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  Your commanders deceived you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=159.5s)]
*  And now I need you to put down your weapons and support me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=161.42s)]
*  He wouldn't have made that speech had they already done that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=165.14s)]
*  So to me, it suggests that he still has a Wagner problem. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=168.54s)]
*  He hasn't solved it yet. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=172.06s)]
*  President Biden emphasized, interestingly so, that the United States and NATO had nothing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=176.1s)]
*  to do with this rebellion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=180.62s)]
*  But in his speech, Putin continues to blame other people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=182.82s)]
*  He blames the so-called neo-Nazis here in Ukraine and their Western patrons for supporting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=186.22s)]
*  it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=192.14s)]
*  The point is that Russians don't all have access to free media. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=193.98s)]
*  So does this propaganda work and does it help strengthen Putin after what's happened this weekend? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=197.62s)]
*  Well, he's had a really tough weekend. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=205.54s)]
*  He's had one of the worst weekends of his life as president. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  So he needs to start pivoting to those kinds of arguments. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, we all talk about this as his worst time, but the last worst time was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=214.78s)]
*  2011, when there were massive demonstrations against a falsified election there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=218.62s)]
*  2011, 2012, that's when I was ambassador. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  And that's exactly what he did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=227.06s)]
*  He said these was concocted by the West, by Obama, Secretary Clinton and me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=228.74s)]
*  And I think we're going to hear much more of that in the coming days. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=234.9s)]
*  He needs to blame the outsiders. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=237.78s)]
*  He needs to frame this as a war between us and, as you said, the neo-Nazis supported by us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HrdPVIhR58&t=239.78s)]
