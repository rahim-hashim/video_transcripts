# ‘Your body, my choice’ Women enraged by emboldened MAGA misogynists
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4)
*  Back in 2016, the election of Donald Trump was a radicalizing moment for many women in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=0.0s)]
*  America and across the world. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=4.72s)]
*  An open misogynist beating Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee of any major party, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  even after the Access Hollywood tape leaked, brought about a global movement through the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  sheer force of women's rage and what they had been asked to endure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=15.84s)]
*  They descended on the capital and cities around the world by the hundreds of thousands, far [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=21.12s)]
*  more people marching for women's rights on President Trump's first full day in office [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=26.36s)]
*  than attended his inauguration. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=30.88s)]
*  Tens of thousands more marching in Chicago, Boston and Seattle and overseas in England, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=33.36s)]
*  Italy, Germany and Paris. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=40.08s)]
*  Crowds of mostly women all protesting President Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=42.28s)]
*  Trump also gave us just a few months actually after those marches, the MeToo movement, another [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=47.2s)]
*  massive cultural shift led by women who were tired of men like Donald Trump, just one example, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=52.84s)]
*  but many, many, many others mistreating and abusing women with seemingly total impunity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=58.2s)]
*  Now nearly eight years later, Donald Trump is heading back to the White House after running, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=64.2s)]
*  I think is fair to say the most misogynistic campaign I've ever seen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=68.44s)]
*  He took credit for tearing reproductive rights away from millions of women. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  He was found civilly liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll and continued [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  to defame her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=80.12s)]
*  Trump's running mate who railed against childless cat ladies, Trump won the election regardless. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=81.12s)]
*  The misogynistic trolls feel even more emboldened than ever before. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=87.28s)]
*  I'm just a girl standing in front of the world asking for a president who isn't a rapist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Request denied! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=99.0s)]
*  The feel when we control your bodies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=100.92s)]
*  Hey, we control your bodies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=102.92s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=106.12s)]
*  Guys win again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=107.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=108.68s)]
*  Win again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  And yes, we control your bodies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm your Republican congressman. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm your Republican congressman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=117.76s)]
*  It's your body, my choice. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  Disgusting comments like that are going viral. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  They're setting the groundwork for a massive backlash. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=128.56s)]
*  One lesson nobody learned from Trump the first time around was that every action has an equal [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=133.12s)]
*  and opposite reaction. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=137.66s)]
*  The action was Trump's ascendancy and the reaction was a global movement centering women's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=139.86s)]
*  righteous anger. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=144.38s)]
*  We are already seeing the ripples of another movement based on that anger and I am predicting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=146.02s)]
*  we are going to get a bigger reaction than 2017 this time around. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=150.58s)]
*  It is just a question of when, where, and how. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=156.66s)]
*  Donald Trump's third bid for the White House was arguably his most misogynistic yet and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=162.98s)]
*  his supporters heard the message loud and clear. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=167.06s)]
*  Even on election night before the race was called for Trump, the sort of white supremacist, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=168.82s)]
*  Nazi friendly troll and Mar-a-Lago dinner guest Nick Fuentes tweeted, quote, your body, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=175.22s)]
*  my choice forever. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=180.62s)]
*  What we are seeing now is a backlash to that rank misogyny. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=181.62s)]
*  Tweets and videos all over social media, women are pushing back against the Trump supporters [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=185.54s)]
*  who want to undo decades of progress on women's rights. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=190.54s)]
*  Now the question is if and when that rage will boil over into something like we saw [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  back in 2017 when millions of women took to the streets to send a clear message to Donald [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=197.78s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=202.7s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist for the New York Times where she writes, this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=203.7s)]
*  is who we are now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Heather McGee, long time progressive strategist, author of the best selling book The Some of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  Us and They Join Me Now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=212.54s)]
*  How are you guys doing? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  We are hanging in there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=215.54s)]
*  I don't think, I really think that there's going to be echoes and rhymes but not repetition [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=219.78s)]
*  second time around. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=225.7s)]
*  So what do you think? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=227.62s)]
*  What do you think is happening? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=228.62s)]
*  So I think, right, I mean, when Donald Trump won the first time it was such a profound [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=230.38s)]
*  shock and it also felt like kind of a fluke or an accident which is part of what propelled [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  so many women onto the street. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  That is not the case this time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, both because there was reason to see it coming, you know, it's no longer improbable [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  and also he won the popular vote, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=246.9s)]
*  So there isn't the same sense of democratic illegitimacy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=250.02s)]
*  And yet, of course, women are both outraged and I think many rightly terrified. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=254.34s)]
*  For now, I think there's something of a pulling back. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=261.34s)]
*  And also, there's, I believe, and I think you're already seeing seeds of this, there [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=265.38s)]
*  was already intense alienation between young men and young women in this country, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=269.62s)]
*  That's part of the kind of seed of this broader social crisis. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=273.62s)]
*  And anyone who thought that Donald Trump's election was going to do anything but exacerbate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=276.9s)]
*  that is in for a rude shock. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=282.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we have to also zoom back and think about where this is all coming from [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=284.9s)]
*  beyond Donald Trump, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=291.02s)]
*  I always like to think about who is selling these racist and sexist ideas for their own [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=293.46s)]
*  profit in addition to who's desperate enough to buy them, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  And who's selling them is an entire ecosystem, an information ecosystem from the video games, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=303.86s)]
*  the podcasters, the sports betting influencers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  It's a whole world that if you're not in it, you really don't know who these people are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  that make up the living, breathing culture of so many young men in this society. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=319.74s)]
*  And they are doing it for profit, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  And then you've got the social media, which now, of course, is owned in part by Elon Musk, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=329.7s)]
*  who not only is going to continue to do what social media just does as its own, which is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  really subsidize and manipulate so that the most outrageous things become the most profitable [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=342.02s)]
*  things for them, but he believes these things themselves. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  He's in fact like a huge avatar of this misogyny and this racism and this greed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=349.94s)]
*  I just think we need to really recognize that everything we believe comes from a story we've [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=355.18s)]
*  been told. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=361.06s)]
*  Yes, that's a great point. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=362.06s)]
*  And these people... [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=363.06s)]
*  They don't just exist. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=364.06s)]
*  They don't just exist. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=365.06s)]
*  They're material conditions, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=366.06s)]
*  There's women advancing in society. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=367.06s)]
*  There's all these things, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=368.86s)]
*  But it's also true that the meaning making about the material conditions is completely [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=370.66s)]
*  owned right now by the right wing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=376.38s)]
*  And that's our problem and our responsibility. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=377.82000000000005s)]
*  I've got to say this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=379.82000000000005s)]
*  I have three kids. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  I have daughter, son, daughter. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  My son is... [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=386.54s)]
*  I don't talk about my kids a lot on the show, but I will just for a moment. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=387.54s)]
*  I love my kids. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=389.78s)]
*  They're totally incredible. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=390.78s)]
*  I think the universe of them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=391.78s)]
*  My son is just like an incredibly sweet and emotionally intelligent kid. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=393.82s)]
*  And one of the things I worry about, I worry a lot of things about my daughters, but one [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  of the biggest things I worry about for my son is the poison, the absolute poison being [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=403.24s)]
*  pumped into the brains of boys. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=410.5s)]
*  Boys, these are children forming that is like this rank misogyny. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=413.62s)]
*  It's so disgusting. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=421.58s)]
*  It's so pervasive. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=422.7s)]
*  I think people that aren't... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=423.7s)]
*  I see it partly because I like to look at a lot of weightlifting videos and the algorithm [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=424.94s)]
*  is just like, oh, you like to weightlift. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=430.06s)]
*  Here's all this horrible stuff. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=432.54s)]
*  And it's a huge problem. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=434.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=436.9s)]
*  And it's a huge problem and it's a problem that is going to get worse. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=438.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it will culturally get worse, but it will also just get worse in terms of any [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=441.73999999999995s)]
*  attempt at regulation, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=445.5s)]
*  Because that's part of what Elon Musk bought with his massive contributions to Donald Trump, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=447.94s)]
*  right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  So they've decided that any attempts to regulate social media is kind of de facto censorship. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  And so they get to just pump this stuff into our kids' feeds relentlessly. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=460.04s)]
*  I mean, I think there's also ways to think about alternatives. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=470.68s)]
*  And like making other meaning. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=471.68s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing that I really am thinking a lot about recently is like making [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=472.68s)]
*  meaning for young people, whatever their gender identity is, about who they are in the world [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=476.92s)]
*  that isn't just like reactionary and bad. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  Listen, I think liberals have gone behind the paywall, right? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=488.04s)]
*  And if you look at news media and media in general, right, you've got the loss of the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=492.72s)]
*  local newspaper, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  70% of newspapers, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=501.44s)]
*  More than half of counties have no local news anymore, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=505.16s)]
*  You've got Sinclair reaching 70%. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=508.32s)]
*  It's a right-wing local broadcaster for news reaching 70% of households. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=511.64s)]
*  So you've lost all of this local news that used to just have a flavor of humanity to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=516.6s)]
*  it and localism in favor of this sort of national zero-sum, fully within the propaganda kind [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  of strategy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=529.96s)]
*  And so in that vacuum, and then you've got, I think it's around 70% of kind of good journalism [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  is behind a paywall, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=539.48s)]
*  And so you're having this education-based gap in what people have access to and information. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=541.4s)]
*  And that is, I think, the sort of table stakes for how we got to this place. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=548.92s)]
*  In terms of these sort of reaction, reaction, which is the thing I keep thinking about, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=554.56s)]
*  having lived through a bunch of cycles where it's like, I woke up on the morning after [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=558.68s)]
*  the last Republican president, one of national popular majority, George W. Bush, just being [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=563.56s)]
*  like, well, we're cooked. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=568.16s)]
*  He's a colossus. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=570.84s)]
*  And then it was like, things change real quick. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=571.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  And you remember, it's like, I've got political capital. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=574.96s)]
*  I'm going to spend it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to spend it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  And it lasted a few months. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=577.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=579.64s)]
*  Because you're trying to privatize social security. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=580.16s)]
*  You got his butt kicked. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=581.64s)]
*  But in terms of this action-reaction, there's this 4B movement that has been propping up. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=583.0s)]
*  And I've been seeing this, which I also think is 100% understandable, but also is part of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=588.48s)]
*  the social media negative polarization turn. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=593.84s)]
*  Explain 4B. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=596.16s)]
*  So 4B, I mean, it's a South Korean movement. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=597.04s)]
*  In South Korea, if you want to look at kind of, not necessarily a worst-case scenario, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=600.92s)]
*  but a scary scenario for where this goes, where women and men are so far apart, where [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=605.0s)]
*  they have an anti-feminist troll as the leader of the country. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=610.24s)]
*  And part of how women have reacted to this rampant misogyny is just to withdraw. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=614.28s)]
*  So 4B movement is just to basically give up men, give up family, give up babies, focus [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=619.56s)]
*  on your career, focus on your own stability. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  And the thing is, women are doing better already in terms of education, in terms of their career [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=628.88s)]
*  prospects. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=634.28s)]
*  And there was, I think, until there was an understanding that that was something, we [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=635.88s)]
*  kind of had to address the pain of young men. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  It's hard to see how you do that when young men are rubbing their hands and trying to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=642.36s)]
*  kind of put their red-hatted, kind of planning to grind their boot into the necks of these women. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=647.44s)]
*  So I think what you'll see is kind of more, because you talk about the media that men [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=657.6s)]
*  are consuming, but women are also consuming their own media on TikTok, their own podcasts, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=661.52s)]
*  which is telling them basically that you need to stay away from men who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=666.84s)]
*  And to your point about the environment we're all in is one where there's a bunch of a few [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=674.24s)]
*  small corporations that basically profit off of the attention that's created by this conflict. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=687.08s)]
*  And meanwhile, policy is being made and we're just, you know... [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=688.08s)]
*  Which meant policy, which was we tried here in our little corner to talk about policy [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  all the time. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  We really did. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=697.96s)]
*  Yes, yes, I know. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=698.96s)]
*  Just totally absent from the campaign. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=700.6s)]
*  No one knows what anyone is. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=704.2800000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that the right is driven by are falling birth rates. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=706.08s)]
*  I mean, if you look at South Korea, you're talking about, you have seen nothing yet. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=709.72s)]
*  And yes, mutual alienation is not going to help that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=713.72s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg and Heather McGee, thank you both. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgdaZ0Xxr4&t=716.0400000000001s)]
