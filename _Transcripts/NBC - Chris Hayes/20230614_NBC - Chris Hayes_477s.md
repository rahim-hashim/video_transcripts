# DOJ’s ‘fantastic’ red carpet: The Trump case vs. the Reality Winner case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0)
*  Since leaving office more than two years ago with hundreds of classified documents, Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump has received consistently special treatment from the U.S. government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  The federal government bent over backwards to offer the extra president, the ex-president, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  extra latitude. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  They gave him opportunity after opportunity to return the classified documents that he [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=16.2s)]
*  removed from the White House and left all over Mar-a-Lago from the ballroom to the bathroom. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=20.76s)]
*  As special counsel Jack Smith's indictment makes clear, they did everything in their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=26.4s)]
*  power to avoid it all coming to this, which is prosecuting the ex-president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=30.56s)]
*  For more than a year and a half, they basically asked nicely before finally searching the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=34.92s)]
*  ex-president's Florida home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=38.2s)]
*  And when the special counsel did eventually bring charges, they did not include, and this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=40.48s)]
*  is crucial, the nearly 200 classified documents Trump returned in January of 2022 after holding [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=44.32s)]
*  on to those for a year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=50.26s)]
*  As Eric Levitz smartly puts it in New York Magazine, the Department of Justice gave Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=52.84s)]
*  a pass on 197 potential counts of willful retention of national defense information. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  Instead, it charged him with only 31 counts, each corresponding with a highly classified [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=62.92s)]
*  document that Trump knowingly withheld from the government in January 2022 and the FBI [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=67.58s)]
*  later obtained. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=73.12s)]
*  That is not how an ordinary citizen would be treated. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=74.94s)]
*  We know that because we saw what happened to, for example, reality winner. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=78.44s)]
*  In 2017, Wynner, an Air Force veteran then working for a military contractor, printed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=83.44s)]
*  out exactly one classified document. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  It was about Russian hackers gaining access to voter registration rolls during the 2016 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=90.56s)]
*  election. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=95.28s)]
*  She took the document home and mailed it to a media outlet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=96.28s)]
*  Wynner was subsequently arrested, jailed, and charged with violating the Espionage Act, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=99.52s)]
*  the same charge Donald Trump is facing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=103.8s)]
*  She pled guilty, apologized, was sentenced to five years in prison. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=106.44s)]
*  Reality Wynner was the first person prosecuted by the Trump administration under the Espionage [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=111.58s)]
*  Act. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=115.44s)]
*  She received the longest sentence ever imposed ever for leaking classified information to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=116.44s)]
*  the media. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=121.0s)]
*  Again, all that for one document compared to the 31 documents that Donald Trump took [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=122.0s)]
*  and refused over and over again to give back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=127.32s)]
*  Alison Krintner Allen is Reality Wynner's attorney and she joins me now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=130.56s)]
*  It's great to have you on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=135.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=136.83999999999997s)]
*  I guess I should start by asking how this all looks to you as someone who represents [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=137.83999999999997s)]
*  someone who did an incredibly long sentence for her single willful retention and then [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  dissemination of a classified document. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=148.76s)]
*  I mean, thank you so much for having me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you, Chris. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=154.32s)]
*  I mean, it looks amazing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=155.76s)]
*  I didn't know that the Justice Department had a red carpet to roll out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=157.44s)]
*  It looks fantastic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=162.96s)]
*  And we'd like to have that sort of treatment if we could. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=164.24s)]
*  So this does not look to you like from your perspective and representing your client like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  this is a DOJ dead set on sticking it to the individual who is named in this indictment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=174.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, this this looks like a DOJ and in fact a whole justice system that is bent [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=182.28s)]
*  on giving him as much of the benefit of the doubt as possible. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=190.4s)]
*  And I mean, that is a stark contrast to what Reality Wynner faces, a stark contrast to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  what any of my clients have seen in the Department of Justice and in the justice system. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=205.76s)]
*  I mean, it's the idea that someone would be charged with espionage and then yet be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=213.64s)]
*  able to travel internationally. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=222.11999999999998s)]
*  It's bonkers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  It defies logic. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  And that kind of consideration isn't applied to well, I mean, I haven't seen it applied [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  to anybody before. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  In your clients in your clients case, she was the FBI shows up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=238.0s)]
*  They have tracked down that she was the one that leaked this document. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=241.68s)]
*  They show up and they question her, I think, in her sort of apartment complex. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=245.0s)]
*  And then am I right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=250.8s)]
*  She's taken into custody and she never sees the outside of a cell until she's released [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=251.8s)]
*  the end of her time served. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=256.64s)]
*  Completely seamless. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  She had several bond hearings and was denied bail over and over again, was seen as a threat [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  to national security for one document that honestly the American people should have known [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=270.0s)]
*  about anyway. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=277.4s)]
*  This is just to be clear here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=278.92s)]
*  This is someone who when you're evaluating whether they should be free, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=280.28s)]
*  This is a person who was deemed by multiple judges at the behest of the Department of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=285.08s)]
*  Justice that requested this as a threat to national security if she was bonded out, if [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=290.2s)]
*  she was allowed to be outside and not incarcerated, who of course no longer had any access to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=294.08s)]
*  any secrets of any kind. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  She didn't work at the place she was. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=302.56s)]
*  There was no plausible means by which she could. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=303.8s)]
*  No plausible future danger at all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=306.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=309.84s)]
*  And she had she never had the kind of access that certainly a president has. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=311.68s)]
*  I mean she was a low level cog in a much bigger machine and we're fairly certain that it's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=319.68s)]
*  because she was such a small part of it that she was a little bit easier to kick around. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=329.04s)]
*  She didn't have the kind of footprint that most people who leaked to the press and certainly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump has. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=340.76s)]
*  I see what you mean. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=342.72s)]
*  So even when you're saying that you're talking about you know there's this Sandy Berger [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=343.72s)]
*  very famous case General David Petraeus that these are individuals who have extremely high [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=346.36s)]
*  profiles and high rank within the national security apparatus or politically valuable. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=353.36s)]
*  That's what you mean. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=358.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=359.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=360.92s)]
*  I mean you know very well that that classified information leaks to the press all the time [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=361.92s)]
*  and and for the most part it comes from higher ranking officials who want to push some kind [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=367.04s)]
*  of political agenda or want the public to know something selectively that makes them [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  look good. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=379.0s)]
*  What is the what's the future for your client. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=381.28s)]
*  I mean as she watches this on her own she's now out of out of prison. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=384.84s)]
*  She's served her time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  Does she she on probation now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  Like where where she is she's still on supervised release. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=395.84s)]
*  She's not allowed to leave the district the Southern District of Texas. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=399.76s)]
*  She will be on supervised release for the next few years and she's consistently monitored [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  by the probation department who I mean she's about the most boring person to monitor at [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=411.32s)]
*  all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  She's a coach and she just takes care of animals and and is living a delayed but her best life [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=425.4s)]
*  The pardon process goes on and and we're waiting for her time to be up to be able to apply [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=426.76s)]
*  for for clemency and pardons. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah she's not hopping on any private jets or doing any pain stops at Versailles cafe. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=436.12s)]
*  She's not crisscrossing the country. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=441.44s)]
*  Nobody even asked her if she had a butler that she needed to maintain communication [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  with. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=448.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=449.96s)]
*  That's an oversight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=450.96s)]
*  Alison Krintner. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=451.96s)]
*  Alan thank you very much for your time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=452.96s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tr47yh8Lo0&t=454.44s)]
