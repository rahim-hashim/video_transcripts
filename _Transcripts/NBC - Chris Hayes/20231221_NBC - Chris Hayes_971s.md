# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 20
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=0.0s)]
*  Colorado Republicans are publicly threatening to change how they vote for presidential nominees [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=2.0s)]
*  in light of yesterday's decision by the state Supreme Court in Colorado [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=7.0s)]
*  to bar Trump from the primary ballot under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=11.0s)]
*  The state GOP now saying it may begin the legally fraught process of switching from a primary to a caucus [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=16.0s)]
*  in order to allow its members to still cast their votes for Trump next March. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=22.0s)]
*  As of now, that mostly just seems like posturing to be honest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=27.0s)]
*  But for all of the controversy, when you go back to the relevant text used to raise the challenge, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=30.0s)]
*  Section 3, the 14th Amendment, it really does stand out as pretty darn fitting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=35.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=41.0s)]
*  No person shall hold any office under the United States, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=42.0s)]
*  who having previously taken an oath as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=46.0s)]
*  shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=51.0s)]
*  You cannot hold government office if you are an insurrectionist or you supported insurrectionists. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=59.0s)]
*  It's quite clear, quite simple, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=64.0s)]
*  especially when you consider the amendment within the historical context of its ratification. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=67.0s)]
*  But this decision from the Colorado Supreme Court yesterday still came as a shock, surprise. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=72.0s)]
*  And that's largely, I think, because of the ways in which American legal culture has grown to emphasize, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=78.0s)]
*  even fetishize some parts of the Constitution and its founding, while largely ignoring others. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=85.0s)]
*  Around the 1980s, the American right embraced the judicial philosophy of originalism, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=91.0s)]
*  thanks in large part to late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=96.0s)]
*  Basically, it's the idea that we should interpret the Constitution only as its founders intended [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=100.0s)]
*  and as people understood it at the time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=107.0s)]
*  To be clear, this was always a reactionary project, often undertaken in transparently bad faith, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=110.0s)]
*  used to reverse engineer the right's preferred political outcomes, and discarded when it didn't fit their agenda. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=116.0s)]
*  But originalism remains a de facto legal theory of the American conservative movement and, honestly, the 6-3 Trump Court. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=122.0s)]
*  And it remains enormously effective as a rhetorical tool because it taps into our shared civic religion of reverence for our founders. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=129.0s)]
*  With that in mind, then, I think it's worth looking at the history of the Reconstruction Amendments, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=138.0s)]
*  which were ratified with the hope of refounding the country after the Civil War, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=143.0s)]
*  without the stain of slavery following the horrible carnage of that war. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=147.0s)]
*  When it was over, 600,000 men had perished. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=152.0s)]
*  But the Union held, and the Constitution, like the nation, was reborn. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=157.0s)]
*  The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments together, but above all the 14th Amendment, is the fruit of the Civil War. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=163.0s)]
*  It is what all those brave men fought for and died for. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=170.0s)]
*  This is from a PBS documentary about the war. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=176.0s)]
*  These amendments, particularly the 14th Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection, completely and utterly transformed the structure of American government. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=178.0s)]
*  The legal ramifications of the 14th Amendment give rise to everything we think of as the modern state and pluralistic, multiracial democracy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=186.0s)]
*  It is impossible to overstate just how important it is to our current understanding of what America is and of constitutional law. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=192.0s)]
*  And yet, its founding, the second founding of the country, the founding amendments after the war, the Reconstruction Amendments, is basically lost to history. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=200.0s)]
*  Its drafters are not household names like the men who drafted Bill of Rights. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=209.0s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=214.0s)]
*  Those men were political radicals. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=216.0s)]
*  The people who drafted the Reconstruction Amendments were the vanguard of radicalism, in fact, who, after defeating the traitorous, insurrectionist slave power of the South, forced them at gunpoint into a participatory, multiracial democracy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=218.0s)]
*  Over the past 150 years, there has been an effort not to reckon with that uncompromising fact. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=233.0s)]
*  That said, if you're going to take an originalist perspective here, that history is pretty important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=240.0s)]
*  The 14th Amendment was indeed a bold act of raw political power in furtherance of that project of multiracial democracy, and it should be interpreted as such. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=245.0s)]
*  And the person most responsible for recovering that fundamental reality of our country's second founding and the constitutional provisions it created is Supreme Court Justice Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=255.0s)]
*  Time and again, she has argued we cannot ignore the radical origins or radical meaning of the 14th Amendment, nor its original intention as a protector of marginalized people in the face of state oppression. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=266.0s)]
*  This has been especially apparent when she talks about things like affirmative action and voting rights. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=277.0s)]
*  I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution, at what the framers and the founders thought about. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=283.0s)]
*  And when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment, in a race-conscious way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=292.0s)]
*  The entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=305.0s)]
*  The legislator who introduced that amendment said that, quote, unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=311.0s)]
*  That's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=327.0s)]
*  No, it's sure not. And the reason that I'm going on this long preamble of history is because this all brings us back to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=334.0s)]
*  The people that wrote that amendment understood that the insurrectionists south and the people that had led it insurrection were an existential threat to the preserved union. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=343.0s)]
*  That those who took up arms against their own government, who betrayed it, on behalf of slavery, those who remain committed to that cause must be eradicated from the government forever, or the union would perish. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=355.0s)]
*  And they were radicals about that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=368.0s)]
*  In fact, the current version of Section 3, that's the compromised version. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=371.0s)]
*  The original, more extreme version of the text would have barred all former Confederates from participating in democracy at all for a number of years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=374.0s)]
*  One founder of the amendment, radical Republican legend Thaddeus Stevens, said that even that would have been, quote, too lenient. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=381.0s)]
*  So now here we are in 2023, faced with the plain meaning of the text written by these lost and forgotten founders whose vision of the country was a radical vision of multiracial equality for men. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=388.0s)]
*  And this majority in Colorado takes an originalist framework when they argue that Donald Trump, the ultimate modern insurrectionist who led an armed mob against the American government, must too be never allowed to hold office again, just like his Confederate predecessors. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=401.0s)]
*  Particularly when it comes to defining what exactly constitutes an office in the United States, which was the exact originalist argument the plaintiffs made when they argued in front of the court that Trump should be ineligible. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=416.0s)]
*  The Constitution tells us over and over that the presidency is an office and that the person who holds it swears an oath of office before assuming the execution of his office. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=428.0s)]
*  And the plain meaning of an officer is just one who holds an office. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=441.0s)]
*  So we think the text here is very clear that the history supports it and certainly that the core purpose of the provision supports that reading as well. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=446.0s)]
*  And I have to say after years of hypocrisy with so-called originalists arguing the First Amendment protects everything from unlimited dark money in our politics, the Second Amendment gives you the right to own military grade weapons detached from the first rather sizable clause in that amendment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=456.0s)]
*  There is something so satisfying about seeing originalism weaponized as a force for good for multiracial democracy and equality. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=470.0s)]
*  The ex-president engaged in insurrection against the United States. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=479.0s)]
*  The Constitution says he is not qualified for office as a result. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=482.0s)]
*  That is the plain truth of the matter and a straightforward reading of the law. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=485.0s)]
*  Now watch all the conservative originalists on the Supreme Court run away from it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=490.0s)]
*  One thing that's quite clear in the Colorado majority opinion is how much the majority is writing for the conservative United States Supreme Court knowing full well they will almost certainly review it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=498.0s)]
*  This is particularly true around the Supreme Court's terms of originalism, original public meaning, a phrase they use, but also in the bedrock conservative principle that states are the ultimate arbiters of and administrators of elections, even federal elections. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=508.0s)]
*  This has been a stalwart conservative piece of jurisprudence and it is in that context that the Colorado justices take Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in his own words when he was an appellate court judge and offer them back at him, citing him saying yes, it is, quote, a state's legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process that permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=520.0s)]
*  This is part of a broader longstanding tendency among conservatives of asserting that states' rights devolve things to the states, even though that is often and has been historically to the great detriment of all kinds of voters of color and all sorts of other populations. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=546.0s)]
*  Now that exact same principle is going to come before Supreme Court that is likely going to find historic and perhaps comical ways to bend itself around to the other view. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=560.0s)]
*  Everyone anticipates they're going to take this case. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=569.0s)]
*  Most people think they will overturn it, but there's almost a Schadenfreude interest in exactly how they're going to do it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=572.0s)]
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at New York University School of Law, co-host of Strict Scrutiny Podcast along with Leah Lippman and my wife, Kate Shaw, Jeffrey Tubin is an attorney and legal analyst, and they both join me now. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=578.0s)]
*  So I don't think there's much suspense like will they take it? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=588.0s)]
*  They're going to take it, though it would be hilarious if they didn't. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=590.0s)]
*  I also don't think there's a ton of suspense about are they going to let this stand? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=592.0s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=596.0s)]
*  The interesting question is like how are they going to get there? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=597.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=600.0s)]
*  So again, we saw that the Colorado majority cited Justice Gorsuch liberally from this 10th Circuit decision when he was a judge, and this was what the kids on Twitter call this you moment. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=601.0s)]
*  So are these your commitments? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=612.0s)]
*  And this is a court that has been very clear about their commitments to textualism, their commitments to strict interpretation, their commitments to this idea of federalism, that there are certain things that are state prerogatives and that are not. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=615.0s)]
*  There are state prerogatives and are for the states to decide including election law. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=626.0s)]
*  And all of this is going to be tested in this case because there's also this outstanding practical concern that if they allow this decision to stand, whether it's because of textualism, federalism or whatnot, it means that there's going to be a patchwork quilt of disqualifications all around this country, patchwork ballots. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=630.0s)]
*  And this election will probably not seem super legitimate to the people that it needs to seem legitimate to. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=647.0s)]
*  And that's a real concern. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=654.0s)]
*  And it's not unlike the kind of practicality concerns that guided the court in Bush versus Gore back in 2000. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=655.0s)]
*  Bush versus Gore, talk about states, right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=661.0s)]
*  It is Bush versus Gore. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=664.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=665.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, what it means to be a conservative is to believe that states get to regulate their own affairs, especially when it comes to elections. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=666.0s)]
*  And this is at issue, a state statute in Colorado about the election. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=676.0s)]
*  Just as in Florida, it was Florida law saying under Florida law, you, Al Gore, are entitled to a recount. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=679.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore said, no, no, no, this would be unfair to George W. Bush. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=687.0s)]
*  It would violate his rights. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=692.0s)]
*  Thus, George Bush's president. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=693.0s)]
*  So, you know, these these principles yield to results that the majority wants to. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=695.0s)]
*  And I expect that's what would happen. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=700.0s)]
*  I have to say, just to add to that, not only did they say no, no, no, it would violate its rights. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=702.0s)]
*  It would violate its rights under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which we have now found a novel interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that this violates, though it's only good, said novel interpretation, for this decision and no more. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=706.0s)]
*  This ticket for this train only. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=721.0s)]
*  That's that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=722.0s)]
*  That was that was the heart of Bush v. Gore. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=725.0s)]
*  So I agree with everything that Jeff has said. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=726.0s)]
*  I think one thing is different is that this is a very different court than the one in Bush versus Gore. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=727.0s)]
*  This is a court whose legitimacy has been called into question numerous times over the last three years. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=731.0s)]
*  This is not the court that was in 2000. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=737.0s)]
*  And I think that has to weigh on them as well. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=739.0s)]
*  I don't know that it will necessarily lead to a different outcome, but it may shape the way they get to that outcome. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=741.0s)]
*  Well, and I also don't want to be I don't want to be over like it is a set of novel issues like they say that in the majority opinion. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=746.0s)]
*  I think they're quite clear about that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=752.0s)]
*  The big question of like, yes, the plain language is clear, but like what counts as insurrection and more, I think precisely who gets to say who is the arbiter of whether an individual counts here? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=753.0s)]
*  Well, and that's that's where I think there is room for the Supreme Court to get rid of this case in a way that is intellectually respectable, which is that's interesting, which is you don't that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=765.0s)]
*  That yes, it is true. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=778.0s)]
*  A president a presidential candidate can be disqualified for supporting and engaging in insurrection. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=779.0s)]
*  But Donald Trump was not given adequate due process. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=786.0s)]
*  He was not given adequate opportunity to prove that he did that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=789.0s)]
*  He did not engage in it, that there was the trial was to attend you was was too brief. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=794.0s)]
*  Right. He wasn't allowed to subpoena witnesses. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=799.0s)]
*  He wasn't allowed to take depositions. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=801.0s)]
*  That's one way of getting rid of the case, overturning it without too much embarrassing themselves. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=803.0s)]
*  And the dissenters in Colorado sort of laid the seeds for that when they talked about the idea that they were very reluctant to disqualify someone in the absence of a criminal conviction for insurrection. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=809.0s)]
*  And so the seeds of this are already in the water. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=820.0s)]
*  So one thing that's very interesting about that, and I also I agree. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=824.0s)]
*  I think there's there's a way out for them to not be as quite sort of like obvious as Bush v Gore, though, sort of where they had they were sort of their backs were up against the wall. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=827.0s)]
*  They were just like, screw it. Right. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=835.0s)]
*  I mean, they were they. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=837.0s)]
*  But but in this case, I mean, what's interesting is, OK, I think that's a colorable argument, right, that this is a serious thing to disqualify from the ballot. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=838.0s)]
*  You need the Constitution requires level process akin to a criminal conviction. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=845.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=849.0s)]
*  What's interesting about that is like, OK, well, he might get a criminal conviction for a crime that isn't explicitly named as insurrection, but is essentially that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=850.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it's like, wow, that becomes a fresh constitutional issue. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=860.0s)]
*  Well, that's why this issue isn't necessarily over. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=864.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=866.0s)]
*  That if if he gets convicted in one of these cases, particularly the Washington, which is the one likely to go to trial first, assuming the Supreme Court lets it go to go to trial. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=867.0s)]
*  If he's convicted again, you if he's convicted for a first time, then you will see other states come back to this issue. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=877.0s)]
*  And then he will there will be an even better argument, right, because he will have gotten due process. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=885.0s)]
*  You know, what's more due process right than a criminal trial? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=891.0s)]
*  So the highest bar we have. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=894.0s)]
*  So it's not this issue. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=896.0s)]
*  Even if this Colorado decision is overturned at this point, it doesn't mean it's over for twenty twenty four. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=898.0s)]
*  Also, I think that may be the way that the court will proceed, like reverse on the Colorado Supreme Court decision, but then allow the claim, allow the trials to go forward that there is no presidential immunity for these criminal indictments. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=905.0s)]
*  But it is worth noting that Jack Smith had the opportunity to specifically charge Donald Trump with insurrection and did not write. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=918.0s)]
*  And so instead, it's this obstruction of a congressional hearing. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=925.0s)]
*  And that may also be chum in the water because there's this Fisher versus United States case where the court has to decide whether the meaning of the statute about obstructing governmental proceedings is meant to apply to something like this or simply something that is meant to apply to Enron, which is the origins of that statute in the first place. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=929.0s)]
*  So there's a lot more that's going to happen here, but the court may try to split this baby. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=946.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlPd0yuH1c&t=955.0s)]
