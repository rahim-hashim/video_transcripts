# ‘Desperate’: Elon Musk begs employees to 'hang onto your stock' as Tesla flounders
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes, the world's richest man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, the guy who essentially bought Donald Trump an election, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=3.08s)]
*  the guy who regularly reposts racist and fascist conspiracy theories, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=6.8s)]
*  who holds no elected office and no Senate confirmed position [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=10.72s)]
*  contra the U.S. Constitution, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=14.48s)]
*  who regularly talks on the phone with foreign leaders of America's adversaries, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=16.28s)]
*  whose business interests around the globe make him a walking, talking intelligence risk. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=21.56s)]
*  That man cashed in on his MAGA investment in a new way today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=26.36s)]
*  This morning, he arrived at the Pentagon like it's one of his subsidiaries, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=30.96s)]
*  like one of the many companies he runs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=34.16s)]
*  Welcome by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to receive, according to multiple reports, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=36.12s)]
*  classified briefings on the workings of the most powerful military in human history. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=41.36s)]
*  Multiple officials told the New York Times yesterday Hegseth and two top admirals [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=47.28s)]
*  were set to present Musk with details on the U.S. plan to counter China [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=52.28s)]
*  in the event of a military conflict between the two countries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=56.28s)]
*  According to the Times, it was unclear what the impetus was for providing Musk such a sensitive briefing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump and Hegseth both called the story fake news, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=66.48s)]
*  but shortly after their denials, the Wall Street Journal confirmed it with their sources. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Musk to receive top secret briefing on U.S. war plans for China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=73.56s)]
*  The Trump team denied those reports, but as they started to get blowback, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  why on earth Musk would have access to this classified briefing? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump then insisted he didn't clear Musk to see the United States' top secret contingency plans [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=86.84s)]
*  for a possible future war with China. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=91.76s)]
*  You guys are denying this New York Times report that Elon Musk was going to be shown a 20 to 30 page presentation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  about a theoretical war plan against China. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=101.68s)]
*  Why not just show it to Elon? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  Because I don't want to show it to anybody. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=107.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=111.12s)]
*  So still, Musk spent 90 minutes today with Hegseth at the Pentagon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=112.64s)]
*  You can see them shaking hands as Musk left. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=115.92s)]
*  He reportedly told the defense secretary, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=118.76s)]
*  if there's anything I can do to be helpful, I'd like to see you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=120.64s)]
*  Moments later, when a reporter asked what the two had discussed, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=124.4s)]
*  the billionaire responded, why should I tell you? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Afterwards, Hegseth joined Trump in the Oval Office, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=129.96s)]
*  where they gave contradictory statements about how Musk was a true blue patriotic American [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=132.88s)]
*  and also a deeply conflicted businessman with overseas interests who can't be trusted with American war plans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=138.28s)]
*  I don't want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=144.88s)]
*  He's a great patriot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=150.8s)]
*  He's taking, he's paying a big price for helping us cut costs, and he's doing a great job. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=151.72s)]
*  He's finding tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=156.44s)]
*  But I certainly wouldn't want, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=160.04s)]
*  Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=161.8s)]
*  Elon Musk is a patriot. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=166.96s)]
*  Elon Musk is an innovator. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk provides a lot of capabilities our government and our military rely on, and I'm grateful for that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about Doge, to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=175.12s)]
*  It was a great, informal conversation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=181.36s)]
*  The rest of that reporting was fake. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=184.0s)]
*  There was no war plans. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=185.56s)]
*  There was no Chinese war plans. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  There was no secret plans. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  I might add that I think Elon, if you, if they ever wanted to do that, I think Elon wouldn't do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=189.48s)]
*  I think he wouldn't do it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  He wouldn't want to put himself in that position. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=195.32s)]
*  You follow all that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=198.32s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=199.44s)]
*  Like, it was all fake news, but also they wouldn't do it, but also maybe they canceled it when the heat got too hot. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  You catch Trump's last point there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  Elon would never put himself in that position. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  For the record, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk, according to one person familiar, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=209.88s)]
*  was going to receive the top secret briefing on China because he asked for one. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=214.04s)]
*  Nobody can say for sure if Musk's sensitive Pentagon briefings today did include Chinese war plans or what they included. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump and Hegseth deny it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=225.56s)]
*  They aren't exactly the most credible sources when they just yell fake news. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=227.28s)]
*  But here's what's interesting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=231.04s)]
*  This is really the key point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  All of this sort of weird back and forth, self-contradictory sort of, oh, no, we would never do that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=234.84s)]
*  But those denials do show they do understand the problem here, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=239.76s)]
*  Like, even Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=245.56s)]
*  It would not sit well with most Americans because, as Donald Trump notes, Elon's business in China makes it a gargantuan conflict of interest. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=247.76s)]
*  China is the second largest market for Musk's Tesla car business. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=258.8s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  Did you know that Musk has multiple Tesla factories in China, including the company's largest production facility in the world, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=263.6s)]
*  which you can see in this video, produced by China's state-run media company? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=269.88s)]
*  OK, that facility produced half of all Tesla cars in the world last year. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=274.92s)]
*  Musk has staked Tesla's future on its operations in China. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=282.56s)]
*  And this is an enormous vulnerability for him because right now, Tesla sales are plunging, especially in China. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  They used to be the hottest electric car in the world, but now they have lots of competition. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=294.68s)]
*  They are getting their butts kicked in China by homegrown car maker BYD, a company started as a battery maker, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  who has eaten Tesla's market share with cheaper cars that don't regularly combust or plow into traffic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  This week, BYD unveiled a battery system that can charge an electric car in five minutes, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=312.2s)]
*  roughly the same amount of time it takes to fill a tank of gas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=317.88s)]
*  As a result, Tesla's China shipments dropped by half in February from a year earlier, just over 30,000 cars. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  That's the lowest monthly figure since July of 2022. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=326.88s)]
*  And of course, this is part of a bigger story about just how brittle Elon Musk's wealth really is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=330.96s)]
*  Tesla is spiraling everywhere. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=337.28s)]
*  The company just announced a recall of all of its cyber trucks to repair body panels that won't stay on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  That recall also tipped reporters off to how many cyber trucks the secretive company has actually ever sold, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=345.6s)]
*  which is less than 50,000. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Then there are the protests, not just in the US, but worldwide demonstrations and boycotts of Tesla to oppose [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  Musk's one-man war on the federal government, including his dalliances abroad, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=360.12s)]
*  where he, like, for instance, endorsed the far-right party in Germany. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=364.2s)]
*  Competitors are now encouraging Tesla owners to trade in their cars, and owners are doing that at a record pace. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=368.0s)]
*  Tesla had accounted for a majority of Musk's wealth until this week, but now its stock has plummeted. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=376.76s)]
*  Over 40 percent of its value gone in the last two months. 40 percent. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=382.04s)]
*  In an all-hands meeting this week, Musk, back at Tesla, begged employees to, quote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=386.44s)]
*  hang on to your stock, but get this, OK? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=392.32s)]
*  In the past three months, top officials in Tesla, people at the top of the company, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=396.96s)]
*  they have sold more than 745,000 shares in the company. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=401.12s)]
*  In that same period, they have bought zero shares of the company they work for. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  Not even a shameless Tesla sales pitch by the American president on the White House lawn can goose Musk's sales numbers. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  Like his wealth, Musk's mystique rests largely on the success of Tesla. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=421.96s)]
*  And listen, that success is now anything but assured. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=427.64s)]
*  Imagine how desperate and erratic that can make a man who's already, I don't know, at least by my perception, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  kind of desperate and erratic, a man who's been deputized to act as an extralegal government enforcer, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=438.4s)]
*  whose operatives are tapping into all of our data and sensitive systems, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=444.12s)]
*  who at least this morning seemed to head to the Pentagon to hear all about our secret war plans with China, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=448.16s)]
*  a country that represents Elon Musk's last best hope for saving his shaking business empire. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lj40f_mPjs&t=452.56s)]
