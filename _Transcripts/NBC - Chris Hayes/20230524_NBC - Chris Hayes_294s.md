# Hayes: ‘Deranged’ GOP debt plan would put these items on the chopping block
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE)
*  Over raising the debt ceiling continues and approaches some kind of deadline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's helpful to understand that there's a reason why this is such favorable terrain [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=3.44s)]
*  for Republicans and why it is so dangerous for all of us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=8.0s)]
*  It's a basic public opinion problem. When you ask the public, and this is true for decades, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=11.68s)]
*  as long as I've been covering politics, when you ask the public generally in the abstract, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=15.6s)]
*  is the federal government spending too much? You tend to get a resounding yes. Recent poll, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=19.6s)]
*  for example, found 60% of U.S. adults said, yes, we are spending too much. But then when you ask [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=25.36s)]
*  people about specific programs, you get a very different answer. In the exact same poll, 65% [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  said there's too little spending on education. 63% said there's too little spending on health care. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=36.32s)]
*  62% say the same on social security, infrastructure. 59% say the same on assistance to the poor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=42.0s)]
*  58% on Medicare. People don't actually want spending cuts. They like these programs. In fact, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=48.32s)]
*  they want to spend more on them. And so, of course, what Republicans have somewhat [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=54.24s)]
*  successfully engineered in this debt ceiling fight is a kind of national debate around the broad idea [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=58.56s)]
*  of spending too much as opposed to a debate about cutting specific things. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=64.72s)]
*  Last month, for example, they passed this ridiculous bill proposing just that, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=70.64s)]
*  Cutting federal discretionary spending to the level of the last fiscal year, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=74.64s)]
*  imposing an arbitrary overall 1% cap on growth, all of it devoid of specifics, right? These are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=78.24s)]
*  just top lines, numbers. And now the negotiations on those all-important details are happening behind [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=84.64s)]
*  closed doors, which also favors them because they don't have to defend individual cuts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=90.24s)]
*  Now they have to decide, well, what are we actually going to cut to get those nice round numbers? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  And the items on the chopping block really tell you how deranged this entire enterprise is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Listen to me here. Republicans reportedly want to cut the vaccine development program, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=106.0s)]
*  $5 billion of funding intended for the next generation of coronavirus vaccines and treatments. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=112.0s)]
*  The program, called Project Next Gen, aims to fund the development of new vaccines that could [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=118.24s)]
*  potentially offer longer lasting protection against a wider array of coronavirus variants or better [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=123.6s)]
*  defense against infections. It also intends to fund the development of pan-coronavirus vaccines, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  which would protect against different coronaviruses and new monoclonal antibody treatments. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a program that builds on Donald Trump's single unambiguous success, Operation Warp Seed, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=144.0s)]
*  that helped to develop the COVID vaccines in record time. The vaccines saved 20 million lives [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=150.32s)]
*  around the world just in their first year. Just think for a moment, we all live this, okay? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=157.84s)]
*  It was just a few years ago, the sheer human misery, illness, death, cost, trauma that could [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=164.24s)]
*  be avoided by investing a tiny portion of the federal budget, I mean tiny, into preparing for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=170.4s)]
*  the next coronavirus outbreak, the next pandemic. Imagine having a vaccine that protected you from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=176.24s)]
*  all coronaviruses? I literally cannot think of a better bang for the buck. But that's what they're [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=182.72s)]
*  going to chop. Because of course, this is what it looks like when you get down to the details. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=189.52s)]
*  The Republican negotiators have essentially taken 85% of the budget off the table, including things [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=195.76s)]
*  like defense spending and social security. There's a pretty small portion left to work with. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=200.64s)]
*  And again, we can't forget the key context here. Over the past couple of years, the American right [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=205.36s)]
*  and the Republican party have collapsed into a vortex of anti-vaccine nonsense that is dangerous, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=210.48s)]
*  disastrous, and disconnected from reality. They have decided the single greatest achievement of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=217.76s)]
*  the Trump presidency, perhaps the greatest health intervention of our time, was actually some sort [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=222.64s)]
*  of malevolent plot. And that anti-vax movement is an outgrowth of the insane neurotic universe of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=229.28s)]
*  extremely online conservatives who spend all day slinging disinformation and offensive memes at [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=236.32s)]
*  each other. The figurehead of that movement, of course, is the weirdest and most extremely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=241.28s)]
*  online right-winger of them all, Elon Musk. And their candidate is the anti-vaccine crusader [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Well, tonight, the two of them met for a truly epically disastrous [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=252.56s)]
*  online launch-ish of DeSantis' presidential campaign. All of the truly amazing details next. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4HliUPhldE&t=260.16s)]
