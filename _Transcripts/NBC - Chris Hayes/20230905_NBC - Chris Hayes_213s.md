# 'We didn't do anything': Proud Boy brags from jail that Trump will pardon him
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo)
*  While Donald Trump is slated to head to trial in March for his role in the attempted coup, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tarrio, who is 39 years old, will spend the next 22 years behind bars for trying to carry [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=4.48s)]
*  out a conspiracy to steal the election, overthrow the government and keep Trump in power. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=9.84s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland released a statement saying, quote, Today, the leader [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=15.22s)]
*  of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, learned the consequence of conspiring to oppose, by [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=18.52s)]
*  force, the lawful transfer of presidential power in 22 years, is 22 years in federal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=22.84s)]
*  prison. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=28.32s)]
*  Tom Jackman is a reporter for The Washington Post. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=29.76s)]
*  He was actually at the courthouse for the sentencing, and he joins me now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=31.48s)]
*  Tom, take us inside today. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=35.04s)]
*  I was getting dispatches from some of the reporters in that media room where you were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=36.68s)]
*  watching the proceedings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  It seemed like a long process and like the judge had a lot to say. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=41.46s)]
*  Well, it was four hours. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=44.24s)]
*  It might have been the New World Record for longest sentencing in one of these cases. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=46.28s)]
*  And the judge did have a lot to say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  There was a lot of talking that went on in this trial, not by him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  So here was his chance to say, I don't think this guy feels sorry about what he did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=55.56s)]
*  As you mentioned earlier, Tarrio did stand up and say, I apologize to law enforcement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=61.34s)]
*  I apologize to the people of Washington, D.C. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=66.88s)]
*  The people of the law enforcement people are heroes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=69.68s)]
*  And the people of Washington didn't deserve to have their city turned upside down. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=72.6s)]
*  And after he was done, the judge said, I think we're talking past each other. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=76.44s)]
*  I don't think I've heard any remorse from this guy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=80.44s)]
*  He's not addressing the whole seditious conspiracy thing, which he didn't. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=83.72s)]
*  That's striking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=89.2s)]
*  And, you know, we had the news last week of Dominic Pizzola, who said he was sorry, that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=90.2s)]
*  it was a mistake. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=96.92s)]
*  And I think he might even shed a tear or two. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=97.92s)]
*  And then cried a lot. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=100.52s)]
*  He cried a lot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=101.52s)]
*  And then once it was once it was done, you know, after he had his 10 year sentence, he [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=102.52s)]
*  yelled Trump won. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=107.44s)]
*  We also have that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  We have Joseph Biggs, who is on Infowars. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  I want to play him too, because this gives you a sense of the preamble to this judge [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=113.76s)]
*  deciding to take their time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=118.04s)]
*  This is Joseph Biggs on Infowars Saturday calling for a pardon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=120.28s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=123.28s)]
*  Oh, I know he'll pardon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=124.28s)]
*  I believe that with all my heart. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=126.44s)]
*  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, you know, for him to be able to get into [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=128.12s)]
*  the position where he can at least be, I think, on the ballot to run. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=134.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=138.2s)]
*  Because once you have one minute remaining. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=139.2s)]
*  I do believe that Donald J. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=141.68s)]
*  Trump will pardon us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=143.0s)]
*  And he should. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=144.96s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, we're his supporters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=147.84s)]
*  We went there like he asked. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=149.56s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=151.72s)]
*  I wonder, you know, how much you can't read the mind. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=152.96s)]
*  But that was an interesting context, given what this judge decided to do today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=156.12s)]
*  Did you hear that recording that said you have one minute remaining? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=160.68s)]
*  That's the recording you get when someone calls collect from jail. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So he only had one minute left in that interview. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=165.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=169.32s)]
*  These people have been waiting for Trump to save them for a long time, and they may be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=169.88s)]
*  waiting a lot longer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=173.84s)]
*  But that's definitely their their last best hope. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=175.48s)]
*  But in the meantime, they're going to be spending time in prison. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Big Scott, 17 years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=182.76s)]
*  He was, you know, on the front lines that day with them bullhorn directing people through [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=184.84s)]
*  the police into the cap. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQmTy0y-wo&t=190.9s)]
