# GOP Rep. Stefanik faces censure push for calling Jan. 6 rioters ‘hostages’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A)
*  A few hours ago, New York Democratic Congressman Daniel Goldman introduced a resolution to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=0.0s)]
*  censure his fellow New Yorker, the fourth most powerful Republican in the House, Elise [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=5.16s)]
*  Stefanik, for comments like this one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=9.36s)]
*  Do you think that the people who storm the Capitol should be held responsible to the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=13.32s)]
*  full extent of the law? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I have concerns we have a role in Congress of oversight over our treatments of prisoners. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=22.48s)]
*  Hostages. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=28.28s)]
*  She called them hostages, like the Israelis taken by Hamas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=29.36s)]
*  Hostages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  Congressman Goldman says that Stefanik's support for convicted criminals who have been charged [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  with offenses against the United States government is, quote, unacceptable for a member of Congress. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=38.08s)]
*  And Congressman Goldman joins me now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=43.32s)]
*  Congressman, was the hostages comment that tipped you over? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=45.52s)]
*  It was sort of the breaking point, I think. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Her rhetoric and support for the January 6 insurrectionists and for generally the conspiracy [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=52.64s)]
*  theories peddled by the criminal defendant Donald Trump have been ratcheting up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=59.68s)]
*  And it's one thing for a rank-and-file member to be saying those things. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=65.0s)]
*  It's altogether something different for the number four person in the leadership of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=68.84s)]
*  House to be attacking our democracy, giving support to those who attacked this Capitol, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=73.08s)]
*  where I stand right now, and instead of doing the work of the House and passing a budget [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=81.56s)]
*  and providing aid to our allies around the world and addressing the issues such as the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  border and inflation and other things that the American people care about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=94.84s)]
*  But this is 2024, Chris. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=98.88s)]
*  It's an election year, and we just cannot have members of Congress who are lining up, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=100.36s)]
*  gearing up to subvert our democracy once again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=107.32s)]
*  And it just felt like we need to lay a marker down right now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't care what Donald Trump says, but sitting members of Congress have a separate oath to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=114.96s)]
*  this body and to our Constitution. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=121.08s)]
*  There's also an interesting context here reporting today from our own NBC and CNBC that there's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  discussions of at least Stefanik as a possible running mate to Donald Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  The thought of Stefanik as a possible choice for Vice President, Trump nodded approvingly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=134.16s)]
*  she's a killer, he said according to the person at the event. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=137.28s)]
*  I suspect he doesn't mean that literally. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=140.28s)]
*  And then further, if you're Trump, you want someone who's loyal above all else, a Republican [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=143.6s)]
*  campaign operative said, and this is important, particularly because he sees Mike Pence as [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  having made a fatal sin. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=151.52s)]
*  Of course, Mike Pence's fatal sin was preserving the Republic in the face of the most concerted [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=152.96s)]
*  effort to destroy it since the Civil War. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=159.48s)]
*  Does it worry you that the way that your colleague Elise Stefanik appears to be auditioning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=164.88s)]
*  for a role as Vice President is to basically give aid and comfort to the very people who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  tried to overturn the Constitutional Republic? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=175.64s)]
*  Well, not only that, Chris, she has refused to say that she will certify the election [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=177.76s)]
*  as Mike Pence did. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=184.6s)]
*  And that is clear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=186.8s)]
*  And it's been clear since 2019 when Elise Stefanik flipped a switch to go from a relatively [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=188.84s)]
*  low key, low level, rational Republican from upstate New York to Trump's biggest defender [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  in the impeachment hearings and then beyond. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  And it is clear that she is channeling Donald Trump in every way that she can, trying to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=207.12s)]
*  to become the vice president. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=212.6s)]
*  And given that she has no morals and no integrity because she completely flip-flopped in all [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  of her policies and politics, for sure, you can't trust her to do the right thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=221.4s)]
*  And that's exactly what Donald Trump wants. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  He wants a sycophant. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  He wants a yes person who will do whatever he says. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=231.68s)]
*  And it is clear that Elise Stefanik in the run up to the 2024 election is trying to play [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=235.32s)]
*  that game. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfehldgOB5A&t=240.96s)]
