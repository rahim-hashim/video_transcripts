# New bombshell report on payments to Ginni Thomas by ‘face of dark money’ Leonard Leo
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8)
*  Indulge me for a moment in a thought experiment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=0.0s)]
*  What if Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's husband [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=3.0s)]
*  was discovered to have been working with a major Democratic donor [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=7.0s)]
*  on the funding of left-wing political activism for several years? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=10.0s)]
*  Say with, I don't know, right-wing villain and multi-billionaire George Soros? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=14.0s)]
*  What would Fox do? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=18.0s)]
*  What would the Republican Party do? They'd lose their mind. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=20.0s)]
*  You would already have impeachment articles drawn up in the House against Justice Jackson. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=23.0s)]
*  Even though George Soros, contrary to what Republicans would like you to think, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=27.0s)]
*  has actually done nothing wrong. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, that is the subject of Politico's new reporting involving [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=32.0s)]
*  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, his wife Ginny, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=35.0s)]
*  and the multi-millionaire conservative judicial activist and lobbyist Leonard Leo. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=39.0s)]
*  This comes on the back of the myriad Thomas scandals in recent memory, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=43.0s)]
*  like when he failed to recuse himself from 2020 election-related cases, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=47.0s)]
*  even though his wife Ginny Thomas has been accused of helping push the coup attempt in 2020. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=51.0s)]
*  Then there was the ProPublica reporting this year, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=55.0s)]
*  revealing how Thomas failed to disclose multiple trips on billionaire benefactor [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=57.0s)]
*  Harlan Crowe's 162-foot yacht, flights on his private jet, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=61.0s)]
*  and weeks at his private resort. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=65.0s)]
*  Or the fact that Crowe paid for his mother's house, where she still lives rent-free. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=67.0s)]
*  Or that he paid for his grandnephew's school tuition, who Thomas raised as his own son. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=71.0s)]
*  That reporting forced him to amend his financial disclosure last month. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=76.0s)]
*  And now a new Politico investigation is adding to that list, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=81.0s)]
*  reporting that Ginny Thomas' web of ties to Leonard Leo is far deeper [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=84.0s)]
*  and more financially entangled than previously known. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=88.0s)]
*  Heidi Prisibler, Heidi Prisibler, excuse me, my pronunciation is always bad, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=92.0s)]
*  is a national investigative correspondent at Politico, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=96.0s)]
*  and is the author of that new report titled, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=99.0s)]
*  What Ginny Thomas and Leonard Leo Wrought, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=101.0s)]
*  How a Justice Wife and a Key Activist Started a Movement, and she joins me now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=103.0s)]
*  Heidi, this is an incredible deep dive from you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=107.0s)]
*  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a statement on your piece today [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=111.0s)]
*  and said, we're living with the consequences of dark money's influence on the Supreme Court every day. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=115.0s)]
*  What was the most striking thing you uncovered in your reporting? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=120.0s)]
*  Well, there were a few striking things, Maddie. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=124.0s)]
*  Look, we've long known that Leonard Leo is the face of dark money [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=126.0s)]
*  behind the conservative Supreme Court movement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=129.0s)]
*  But what we found was that the collaboration between him and the wife of a Supreme Court justice, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=131.0s)]
*  Thomas's wife Ginny, actually began just weeks before his decision in that Citizens United ruling, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=138.0s)]
*  which would, of course, benefit those very groups. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=144.0s)]
*  What we found also was that when that blew up, which was pretty quickly, Maddie, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=148.0s)]
*  when people found out that she is going to have her own dark money group, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=152.0s)]
*  there was a lot of backlash to that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=155.0s)]
*  And this is the big reveal in the story, is that there was a Plan B, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=157.0s)]
*  and that Plan B was activated almost immediately. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=161.0s)]
*  They pivoted to another dark money group and started paying her under the table. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=164.0s)]
*  Part of that was, we know, through Kellyanne Conway. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=169.0s)]
*  But the big question here, Maddie, based on all of the documentation that I had five IRS experts look at, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=173.0s)]
*  is did he ever stop paying her? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=179.0s)]
*  What did he pay her for? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=183.0s)]
*  Did this go on for years? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=185.0s)]
*  Because unlike the first plan, Plan A, which was for them to have their own dark money group together, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=188.0s)]
*  that blew apart, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=193.0s)]
*  We're not finding out about Plan B, which is this under-the-table arrangement [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=195.0s)]
*  where he was paying her via another dark money group [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=199.0s)]
*  and just having it billed with no mention of Ginny, of course, whether that ever ended. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=203.0s)]
*  And if you look at the arc of all of this, a lot of the people in Thomas' orbit, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=209.0s)]
*  for instance, former law clerks, were kind of brought into this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=214.0s)]
*  It is his former law clerk, Kerry Severino, who for a time became one of the highest paid directors at this group, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=218.0s)]
*  which is a non-profit group. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=224.0s)]
*  That's a whole separate can of potential worms there, Maddie, which I can get into in a minute. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=226.0s)]
*  But it stands that we don't know what kind of work she did for this charitable group. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=232.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be a charitable group. It's tax-exempt. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=237.0s)]
*  And whether the payments ever stopped. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=240.0s)]
*  P.C.E. 2 is about non-profit tax law, and I do not want to bore you all with this, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=242.0s)]
*  but it is something that's super important because it's the subject of a D.C. Attorney General investigation right now, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=247.0s)]
*  is the potential abuse of non-profit tax laws by Leo's network of dark money groups. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=257.0s)]
*  I'm sure all these non-profits were totally neutral in accordance with charity law. Of course they were. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=263.0s)]
*  Heidi, you report that a person familiar with Ginny Thomas's thinking around 2010, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=268.0s)]
*  before the Citizens United ruling, said, quote, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=272.0s)]
*  Ginny really wanted to build an organization and be a movement leader. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=274.0s)]
*  Leonard, Leo, was going to be the conduit of that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=278.0s)]
*  Do we have an idea of how much money Leo has directed to Ginny Thomas or the timeline of when the payments began? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=281.0s)]
*  The timeline of when the payments began I might be able to be more helpful on. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=288.0s)]
*  The full amount of the money, I made several passes at them on and asked both representatives for Thomas [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=292.0s)]
*  as well as Leonard Leo's group and got no answers on that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=300.0s)]
*  But the timeline is extremely interesting, and I encourage everybody to click inside the story [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=304.0s)]
*  because we worked hard to kind of distill that for you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=309.0s)]
*  However, it shows that to the month that the non-profit experiment between Leonard and Ginny blew up, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=312.0s)]
*  by the way, because of a phone call that she made to Anita Hill, which drew unwanted attention to her. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=321.0s)]
*  But when that blew up, they pivoted immediately. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=326.0s)]
*  I mean, like within days, Ginny Thomas filed paperwork to create her own for-profit group. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=329.0s)]
*  And this group, the Judicial Education Project, which was used subsequently to pay her, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=335.0s)]
*  was retroactively reactivated to a little bit earlier in the year. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=341.0s)]
*  And the same amount of money, similar amount of money that she had made at her first stab at having her own non-profit with Leonard [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=346.0s)]
*  was then deposited into the Judicial Education Project, of course. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=354.0s)]
*  That is the problem, the actual essence of the problem with dark money, is we have no idea what it was used for. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=359.0s)]
*  There was some IRS reporting discrepancies about how much it actually took in that were flagged to me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=366.0s)]
*  I had to do a lot of work going through all of this tedious job of going through all of the IRS paperwork. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=372.0s)]
*  And thank God for the IRS experts, including the former commissioner, who really helped me distill it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=379.0s)]
*  We are glad you did it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=385.0s)]
*  Heidi, you reported recently that Leonard Leo's network of nonprofits, profitable groups, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=387.0s)]
*  is the subject of a Washington, D.C., Attorney General investigation looking at whether Leo enriched himself and his friends. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=392.0s)]
*  Do you have an update on that investigation at all? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=398.0s)]
*  No update, because that was not something I think that the D.C. Attorney General really wanted out there in the first place. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=400.0s)]
*  They prefer to keep these things quiet. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=408.0s)]
*  But I did come upon that information, particularly because some of it included my prior reporting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=411.0s)]
*  and was able to inform people that there is this investigation ongoing of Leonard Leo and his broader orbit of nonprofits, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=418.0s)]
*  and then the possibility of a real cause, Medi, within the two years after Leonard Leo went to a for-profit from his full-time role at the Federalist Society, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=426.0s)]
*  $43 million went into his for-profit company, and again, we had trouble getting answers as to what kind of services were rendered for this money. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=434.0s)]
*  And then secondly, there were just a lot of examples there of individuals setting up side LLCs who were friends of Leonard, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=446.0s)]
*  including a very good friend who had taken in $7 million to his nonprofit even after its nonprofit status had been auto revoked by the IRS. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=453.0s)]
*  I wish the Senate Democrats were doing as much investigating as you are. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=463.0s)]
*  Heidi Prisbilla, thank you so much for your reporting. Really appreciate it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=468.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjaGlba1q8&t=483.0s)]
