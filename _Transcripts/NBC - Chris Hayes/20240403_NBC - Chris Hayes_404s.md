# ‘Ludicrous’: Trump judge's 'Alice in Wonderland' order scorched by Jack Smith
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4)
*  What is the purpose of this filing that Jack Smith filed in response to Judge Cannon? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=0.0s)]
*  So for starters, Chris, it's just what you say that the law that she's entertaining is ludicrous, that position. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=8.0s)]
*  Moreover, it's got no basis in facts. He's never even tried to assert. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=15.52s)]
*  But there's an extra important step here that makes this really aggressive, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=19.36s)]
*  because what's been really vexing about Cannon is she has, again and again, just refused to rule, period. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=23.52s)]
*  And this kind of academic exercise, let's talk about jury instructions, not only avoids a ruling, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=32.72s)]
*  which is what you need to take things on appeal, but even suggests she might do this kind of mischief [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=38.8s)]
*  at trial, after which double jeopardy would prevent a retrial. So what Smith says is all, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=44.8s)]
*  everything you say, but one step more. He is saying you have to decide this, Judge Cannon, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=51.68s)]
*  and you have to decide it in plenty of time for us to appeal. And if you don't, if you continue to dither, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=57.84s)]
*  then we are going to mandamus you for the very act of not deciding. So far, you haven't given us enough [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=66.56s)]
*  to latch onto, but guess what? If you continue to not give it to us, we are going to mandamus that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=73.12s)]
*  very point. And as you said, you have an 11th circuit, I think pretty well primed by her previous [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=79.52s)]
*  conduct to know something is amiss. So they're calling out not just the law, but her whole cat [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  and mouse game of not issuing decisions. Yeah, the way you say it in the column, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=90.64s)]
*  because I want to read just to underline this point, that the Judge Cannon's Alice in Wonderland [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  antics seem designed to avoid issuing a ruling that prosecutors could appeal while also setting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=99.36s)]
*  the stage for her to adopt Trump's ridiculous claims after a jury has been impaneled, which could [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=104.16s)]
*  be a fatal blow to Smith's case, because once a jury is selected, even a ridiculous order can [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=108.56s)]
*  bring prosecution to a hard stop because the Constitution's double jeopardy clause precludes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=113.36s)]
*  retrial. It would be the judicial equivalent of a perfect crime. Christy, again, some of the stuff [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=118.0s)]
*  is complicated, and I'm not going to pretend that I feel like I know it really well. But the basics [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=124.72s)]
*  here do seem to me almost bewilderingly clear insofar as the Presidential Records Act obviously [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=131.52s)]
*  cannot mean. Obviously what his lawyers are saying it means and indulging it seems ludicrous. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  It does. It seems as though the Presidential Records Act in this context, it's like if you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=152.96s)]
*  were taking a law school exam, this would be what we'd call a red herring. It's completely irrelevant, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=159.6s)]
*  and it's really something that Trump's defense is trying to use to divert from really the main issue, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=166.24s)]
*  which is whether or not he violated the Espionage Act. Not only is she failing that law school exam [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=171.6s)]
*  by kind of engaging with this red herring, but to continue with the analogy, she won't even hand in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=178.72s)]
*  the exam to get graded because she won't decide the actual issue. She keeps holding back and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=183.84s)]
*  reserving decision and kind of having this weird proposed jury instruction where it's almost choose [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=189.52s)]
*  your own adventure, whether the jury decides that they're personal records or whether it's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=196.16s)]
*  Donald Trump decided they were personal records. Either way, under either scenario she has, he's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=200.88s)]
*  somehow entitled to have kept them, which is obviously wrong under the law. And so what [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=206.56s)]
*  Jack Smith is saying is it's time. You've got to make a decision. You need to make a decision [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=212.48s)]
*  promptly, well in advance of trial, so that if you get it this wrong, again, we need to take this up [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=218.0s)]
*  to the 11th Circuit. Right, and that's a really important point, which is that the interpretation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=224.64s)]
*  is ludicrous on his face and also immaterial to the law that controls here, which is the Espionage [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Act, which is that this is national defense information, plain as day, and you had it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=232.88s)]
*  And you were like, so there you go. And we asked for it back and you didn't give it to us. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=238.08s)]
*  So let's talk about the New York case, Harry. I'm going to come back to you, Christy, which is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=242.96s)]
*  Judge Murchon there doing the opposite of Judge Cannon in this sense, which is ruling on this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=248.16s)]
*  immunity, this sort of immunity Hail Mary. He basically said that he waited too long to raise [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=253.2s)]
*  the issue, that there's so clearly last minute. He denied Trump's motion to delay the trial start [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=260.4s)]
*  date until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on this immunity claim in federal action interference case [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. All that seems to mean we're on for April 15th as of now. Is that your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=269.28s)]
*  understanding, Harry? Exactly right. And it's more than that. Remember, this is what he was able to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=274.32s)]
*  leverage in other settings to get a delay. Well, what Murchon has said is, I'm not going to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  entertain it. You are late. Moreover, you are so late. I doubt this is very dramatic language in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  the order. I doubt the sincerity and purpose of what you're doing. You have just basically [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=294.0s)]
*  waited till the last minute to try to delay things. Uh-uh. I'm not even going to consider it because [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=299.52s)]
*  it's untimely. And really, I don't think he has cards left to play. We are, as you say, you know, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=304.4s)]
*  12 days away from picking a jury in the first ever criminal trial of a former president. Christy, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=310.64s)]
*  is that your read as well? I agree with Harry. Looking at the opinion, we are seeing the judge [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=316.08s)]
*  really get stronger and stronger in his language with each one of these frivolous motions from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=324.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's defense team, starting out with the discovery violations, which turned out to be a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=330.56s)]
*  nothing burger. There were no discovery violations. Then we had the motion for recusal, which again [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=335.12s)]
*  had already been brought in August of 2023. They had nothing new to say, but they brought it up [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=341.2s)]
*  again at the 11th hour to try to delay this trial. And now we're seeing with this motion [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=345.92s)]
*  for presidential immunity, which is completely untimely. And the court is calling out what it is, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  says the circumstances of this really tests the court's credulity here. You know, it's clear what [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=358.24s)]
*  you're doing. What you're doing is just trying to delay this thing and he's not going to entertain [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=363.76s)]
*  it anymore. Harry Lippman, Christy Greenberg, thank you both. Appreciate it. Hey everyone, MSNBC has [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KNvQpTDl4&t=369.04s)]
