# ‘Absurd’: Sen. Kim on MAGA conspiracist Laura Loomer's White House influence
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE)
*  I truly believe that the people who engaged in the coup against Donald Trump and have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=0.0s)]
*  caused civil unrest and chaos in our country for the last seven years through crossfire [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=6.2s)]
*  hurricane and also through these, what I believe are illegal witch hunts against the president [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=12.46s)]
*  of the United States right now, unconstitutional witch hunts against Donald Trump, they are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=17.2s)]
*  treasonous. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=21.76s)]
*  They are traitors. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=22.76s)]
*  They should get the death penalty when they are jailed in the next Trump administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=23.76s)]
*  We first learned about the Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump, high-level cabinet officials [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=28.58s)]
*  like Vice President, JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and National Security [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=32.9s)]
*  Advisor Mike Waltz and that woman you just heard, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer yesterday [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=37.339999999999996s)]
*  morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=42.66s)]
*  It was a meeting the New York Times reported lasted for half an hour and resulted in six [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=43.66s)]
*  firings from National Security Council after Loomer laid out a list of people she believed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=48.42s)]
*  were disloyal to Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=53.12s)]
*  Earlier in the day Donald Trump was asked about on Air Force One and confirmed that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=55.1s)]
*  yes, the lady who thinks 9-11 was an inside job, who was banned by Uber and Lyft for her [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=57.9s)]
*  anti-Muslim tirades, who changed herself out the doors of Twitter when she was banned from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=63.0s)]
*  that does give the president recommendations and sometimes he does listen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=67.7s)]
*  Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=71.9s)]
*  She is a very strong person and I saw her yesterday for a little while. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=76.9s)]
*  She makes recommendations of things and people and sometimes I listen to those recommendations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=82.7s)]
*  What did she recommend? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=88.7s)]
*  She recommended certain people for jobs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=91.7s)]
*  Adding to the administration, not firing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=94.7s)]
*  Well, she'll recommend that too. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=97.7s)]
*  Did she have anything to do with the NSC aides who were ousted? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=99.7s)]
*  No, not her. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=103.7s)]
*  Do you know how many, sir? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=105.7s)]
*  Do you know how many from the NSC? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=106.7s)]
*  Not many. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=107.7s)]
*  Was it five, a dozen? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=108.7s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=111.5s)]
*  He doesn't seem to care that much either way or be that checked in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=113.5s)]
*  Now the president of the United States said right there that he does not know who was actually fired. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=116.5s)]
*  Well, we now know that as many as six people were fired, including, get this, the chief [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=120.5s)]
*  of the National Security Agency and the deputy director. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=124.5s)]
*  And then, guess what? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=127.5s)]
*  In a lengthy post, Laura Loomer took credit for all, claiming, as she had said in the Oval Office [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=128.5s)]
*  meeting, they had been disloyal to Trump, the NSA director was fired for being handpicked [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=132.5s)]
*  by General Milley, who was accused of committing treason by President Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=137.3s)]
*  Senator Andy Kim is a Democrat in New Jersey. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=141.3s)]
*  Before he was elected to Congress, he was a career public service, serving the Pentagon, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=143.3s)]
*  the State Department, and on the White House National Security Council, and he joins me now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=146.3s)]
*  Senator, this feels like a kind of bad fever dream or like a bit of parody, but it's real. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=151.3s)]
*  What is your reaction to finding out this individual has essentially firing power, even [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=158.3s)]
*  over someone who's the head of the National Security Agency? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, it would be absurd and hilarious if it wasn't so scary in terms of how it actually [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  manifests here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I worked at the National Security Council for two years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  The National Security Council is supposed to be the best of the best. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  It's supposed to be part and part a quarterback and a flight control in terms of everything [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  that is happening in foreign policy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=192.5s)]
*  In fact, it used to be said that nothing could get to the president about foreign policy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=194.5s)]
*  unless it went through the National Security Council, which clearly now is no longer the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=199.5s)]
*  case, as apparently Laura Loomer has an ability to be able to get to the president about foreign [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=203.7s)]
*  policy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=208.2s)]
*  And that's just so alarming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  And to the point that you had with your previous segment, if you want to know why there's so [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=211.42s)]
*  much chaos and confusion about what happened with regards to the tariffs, I can say it's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=215.22s)]
*  because of the absolute dysfunction of this National Security Council as demonstrated [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=220.7s)]
*  by what just happened with Laura Loomer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting point we were showing Laura Loomer and the president, who [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  do seem to be quite close. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=230.89999999999998s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=234.0s)]
*  Why do you say that there's some relationship between the sort of organizational dysfunction [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=235.0s)]
*  and then these crazy outcomes like the genuinely ludicrous chart that the president came out [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=240.14s)]
*  with? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=245.94s)]
*  Yeah, so the National Security Council, it doesn't handle everything in our foreign [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=247.18s)]
*  policy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=251.7s)]
*  What it handles is it determines what needs to go to the president for a decision and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=252.7s)]
*  it runs the process by which to shape that decision-making that the president is going [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=257.14s)]
*  to have to do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=262.9s)]
*  So absolutely, for instance, with the tariffs, that is something that needs to go to the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=264.26s)]
*  president for a decision. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=269.02s)]
*  And it's very clear that that process was absolutely dysfunctional. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=270.1s)]
*  In fact, it was probably filled with people like Peter Navarro, Laura Loomer and others [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  as well feeding into the president's mindsets about this and not actually listening to a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=278.62s)]
*  lot of the experts that we have throughout our government. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=283.78s)]
*  People like General Howe, who was just fired at the National Security Agency. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=287.34s)]
*  And when you hear Laura Loomer talk about him, she talks about him as someone who was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  appointed by Biden. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=296.34s)]
*  She has no idea what it means to be a career public servant to someone who has served in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=298.34s)]
*  both Republicans and Democrats like myself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  I served under Bush and Obama. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=305.74s)]
*  But she has no idea. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  She can't fathom the idea that someone would serve the country and not be loyal or pledge [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=309.5s)]
*  fealty to a particular president. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=314.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, just to put up General Howe's quick bio, he was head of the U.S. Cyber Command. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=316.06s)]
*  He had 30 years of military service, commander of the 16th Air Force in San Antonio. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, a very distinguished, long career and I think a sort of nonpartisan figure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  We're in the Senate well right now because the Republicans are having a kind of votorama [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=331.58s)]
*  to set up their big tax bill. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=337.9s)]
*  And this relates back to the tariffs, I think. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=341.7s)]
*  My understanding, honestly, is that one way to make sense of the total chaos and insanity [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=344.5s)]
*  of what's the largest tax hike ever unilaterally imposed by an American president, as far as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=349.06s)]
*  I can tell, is that he wants that so that he can then cut taxes for rich folks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=353.82s)]
*  And the Senate Republicans are sort of starting the ball rolling towards that process tonight. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=360.02s)]
*  Is that how you understand what's going on here? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=365.18s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, there's an equation here as well to be looked at. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=367.02s)]
*  And what you see on one side is you see, as you said, the largest tax cut, I mean, this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=371.3s)]
*  massive tax cut, I'm sorry, this massive tax with the tariffs that is now put on the American [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=375.98s)]
*  people in a regressive way that's going to hurt so many families struggling. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=381.26s)]
*  To add to that the gutting of Medicaid, which is what the Republicans are trying to do here [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=385.14s)]
*  at the Senate tonight, and what is that in service of? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=390.86s)]
*  It's not meant to try to bring down the deficit or anything that resembles financial responsibility. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=393.74s)]
*  It's going to go to tax cuts, $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to billionaires that have so much [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=400.9s)]
*  money there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=408.7s)]
*  They have their own space program individually. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=409.7s)]
*  It's like one of those things where I just, I can't stress to the American people enough [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=412.66s)]
*  to really follow the money here and see what is happening. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=417.22s)]
*  They are taking our hard-earned money through these tariffs, the tax that is just levied [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=420.7s)]
*  by the president, through this effort that we're going to be here probably until 4 or [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=425.18s)]
*  5 a.m. tonight trying to do our best to highlight and show to the American people what is happening [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=428.9s)]
*  right before us, that they're going after people with disabilities, seniors and long-term [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=433.86s)]
*  care, nursing homes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=438.7s)]
*  The amount of every three kids in my home state of New Jersey gets their care through [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=440.3s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=443.58s)]
*  You know, that is what they're trying to take away in order to give Elon Musk a bigger tax break. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF6ZDot67UE&t=444.58s)]
