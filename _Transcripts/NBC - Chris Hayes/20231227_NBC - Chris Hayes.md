# All In with Chris Hayes - Dec. 27  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo)
*  Good evening from Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jason Johnson and for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=6.8s)]
*  We're waiting for the special counsel to respond to Donald Trump's wildly expansive claim of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=9.92s)]
*  presidential immunity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=14.36s)]
*  Trump says he can't be prosecuted for January 6 because he was acquitted in his Senate impeachment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=16.1s)]
*  trial and he contends that he is quote, absolute immunity from prosecution for his official [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=21.28s)]
*  acts as president. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=26.36s)]
*  Jack Smith is expected to respond to those claims before the appeals court hears arguments [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=28.08s)]
*  on Trump's immunity claims on January 6th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=32.8s)]
*  All rulings on the January 6th case are currently on hold while that appeals process plays out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=35.92s)]
*  But that didn't stop the special counsel from filing a new motion with Judge Chania [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=41.04s)]
*  Chutkin today, asking the court to not allow quote, the defendant to turn the courtroom [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=45.08s)]
*  into a forum in which he propagates irrelevant disinformation and should reject his attempt [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  to inject politics into this proceeding. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=56.48s)]
*  Smith also wants the court to quote, prohibit the defendant from introducing evidence, making [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  arguments or framing questions to advance a theory of selective or vindictive prosecution. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=64.52s)]
*  Basically, special counsel wants to make sure Trump can't say this is Joe Biden's DOJ targeting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  him and in response, Trump said Joe Biden's DOJ is targeting him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=76.4s)]
*  A rant by the ex-president called Jack Smith crooked Joe Biden's errand boy and a campaign [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=81.72s)]
*  email that went out just hours after the filing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=86.76s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is Ryan Riley, justice reporter for NBC News and author of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=89.88s)]
*  Sedition Hunters, how January 6th broke the justice system. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=94.48s)]
*  Ryan, thanks so much for joining me this evening. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=98.8s)]
*  Look, I have to start with this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  So one part of the ruling we're waiting to hear, Jack Smith is basically laying out to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=103.68s)]
*  Judge Chutkin, I don't want Trump to do the thing that we know that Trump is going to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=109.92s)]
*  do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=114.76s)]
*  Is this working the refs? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Is this sort of saying, hey, you know that Shaq is going to spend more than three seconds [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  in the key? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Is he working the refs here or does he actually think that Judge Chutkin is going to be able [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  to stop Trump from doing the thing that he always does? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=127.2s)]
*  Hey, Jason, you know, I think that this has happened in case after case before with other [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=129.64s)]
*  January 6th defendants where they've tried to bring up these sort of irrelevant charges [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=134.84s)]
*  that aren't based in any fact or reality about the FBI sort of setting up January 6th, this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=139.6s)]
*  notion that the FBI was controlling these figures behind the scenes who were directing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=146.08s)]
*  these Trump supporters to do these terrible things. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=150.52s)]
*  And, oh, lo and behold, I got caught and did something I wasn't supposed to do. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=152.72s)]
*  And, you know, I think it sort of speaks to the failure of the January 6th committee in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=158.04s)]
*  some respects, because the January 6th committee didn't end up focusing a lot on the FBI failures [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=161.76s)]
*  that lead up to January 6th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=166.84s)]
*  And because of that, you have a lot of people who are willing to sort of accept these these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=169.24s)]
*  bizarre conspiracy theories that all lean on this idea that the FBI is extremely competent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=173.96s)]
*  and was pulling these things behind the scenes, when in reality, there were just a bunch of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=179.44s)]
*  failures that led up to January 6th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=183.16s)]
*  And what happened is a bunch of Trump supporters thought that the election was stolen and stormed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=185.04s)]
*  the Capitol. What happened is pretty simple, but they're trying to bring in all of these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=189.0s)]
*  other facts around it and trying to or other disinformation around it and trying to pretend [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  like there's some grander conspiracy here that the FBI is all behind it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=198.28s)]
*  Having read through thousands of pages of FBI emails, I mean, it should be ridiculous on its [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=201.72s)]
*  face. But once you read these emails and see how many problems there were there were from the FBI [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  in the lead up to January 6th, it really starts to seem absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=211.72s)]
*  It's always interesting to me, Ryan, that that anti-government conspiracy theorists think the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  government is terrible and competent until it suits their conspiracy theory. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=220.72s)]
*  And then suddenly they're all geniuses and all able to do everything that they want them to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  Speaking of this, I think this conspiracy is key. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=228.88s)]
*  In the Smith filing, he talks about this idea of undercover agents. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  And he says, look, we don't want to allow defendants to introduce evidence about undercover [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  actors because that would inevitably lead to confusing many trials on collateral issues, such [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  as the identities and intentions of the alleged undercover actors. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  For example, it may require the government to introduce evidence to show that people whom the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=247.12s)]
*  defendant alleges were undercover actuaries were actually his vehement supporters. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=251.76s)]
*  Ryan, you've written about this, and I find this to be one of the most critical elements of any [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  prosecution about Trump on January 6th. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=261.68s)]
*  How can we stop that from happening? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  How can you prove a negative? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=266.64s)]
*  Because Trump supporters, as you sort of pointed out, have long pushed this theory that this is all [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=268.48s)]
*  this sort of Scooby Doo conspiracy theory that if you pull off the mask, it was antifree, but if you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=272.4s)]
*  pull off the other mask as the Trump supporter, but that person is innocent, how do you stop that in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=277.0s)]
*  court? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=280.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's almost comical, but it does become this big distraction and this big time [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=282.2s)]
*  waster. There's a recent case, and I wrote about this last week, but there's even a more recent [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=286.24s)]
*  case since my piece last week involving someone that people alleged were was a antifa supporter [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  who ended up, lo and behold, just to be a Trump supporter. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=296.68s)]
*  But it's happened time and time again. One of the sort of most hilarious examples to me is that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=299.0s)]
*  there's an individual who two people on the very day of there were two people dressed in black and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=304.48s)]
*  people were yelling in the crowd at that moment, getting sucked into these conspiracies theory, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=309.44s)]
*  saying they're antifa, they're antifa. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=313.2s)]
*  What was that based on? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=315.04s)]
*  Basically, if you're wearing black or if you're smashing windows, you were automatically assumed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=316.2s)]
*  to be antifa, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=320.44s)]
*  There was not like a deep inquiry into the political ideology of the individual smashing the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=321.44s)]
*  windows at the time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=326.08s)]
*  It was just like, oh, they have to be antifa. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=327.12s)]
*  And then, lo and behold, one of them was a guy who went around to Trump rallies, was one of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  quote unquote front row Joe's who went to Trump rallies because he went around the country, got in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=333.92s)]
*  line and was one of the first people in line for a lot of Trump rallies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=338.92s)]
*  The other individual was actually just arrested more recently, and he's also a deep Trump supporter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=341.56s)]
*  I went back and scrolled through his Facebook page back in 2020. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=347.04s)]
*  And, you know, it's pro Trump, me and after pro Trump mean anti Biden, me and after anti Biden mean. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=350.88s)]
*  And then there's the fact, of course, that he tried to storm the Capitol after Donald Trump said you [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  have to fight like hell. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=360.16s)]
*  So it just happens time and time again where there's supposed to be this next mystery under the, you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  know, it's going to be under the next door and they just fail over and over and over again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=366.16s)]
*  But at some point, it kind of gets into the, you know, a lot of people start to believe it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=370.0s)]
*  And a lot of Trump supporters really do believe that this was some undercover antifa operation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=373.92s)]
*  And so Donald Trump would, if he has the opportunity to take advantage of that to any extent that he [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=378.64s)]
*  could. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=383.52s)]
*  Ryan Riley, thank you so much for starting us off this evening. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=385.24s)]
*  Our next guest, Harry Littman, is a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=389.4s)]
*  Justice and is now a legal affairs columnist for the Los Angeles Times. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=394.12s)]
*  Paul Butler is a former federal prosecutor who served in the Public Integrity Unit of the DOJ and now [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=397.68s)]
*  teaches at Georgetown University Law Center. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=403.32s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  This is I'm glad to have you all here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=407.68s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. I don't play one on TV. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=410.12s)]
*  So I always like to have people sort of explain the legal consequences of this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=411.84s)]
*  Harry, here's my question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  So what does Jack Smith hope is going to be the ruling? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=418.88s)]
*  Like, what could Chuck can actually say? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  What could her ruling be? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  Would she basically be able to say, hey, any reference to undercover agents is thrown out? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  Would that limit what Trump can actually say in trial? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=434.88s)]
*  What's a ruling that he would actually like to come down before we hear some of the rulings about January 6? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=437.48s)]
*  That's definitely it, because these are rulings that she could otherwise make during the trial [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  during the heat of the trial. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=448.36s)]
*  And Smith is saying, let's do this up front and just get this off the table. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  So look, if you're doing it's not simply that these things, as Ryan detailed, are far fetched. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=454.2s)]
*  They are legally irrelevant. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=459.56s)]
*  The jury's job is to decide the truth or falsity of the charges, not to nullify the charges for some political [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=461.36s)]
*  sympathy. So if she has made this ruling, and I believe she will, and as Ryan says, they've done it in other [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=468.76s)]
*  settings, then when Trump, and I believe he will, tries to inject it in one way or another, did you think [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=475.0s)]
*  possibly that by objection, your honor, sustained? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=481.84s)]
*  And so it shuts it down right away because there's already a ruling in place and she can rap on the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=485.79999999999995s)]
*  lawyer's knuckles right away. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=493.32s)]
*  I think this will be a theme in the trial where he tries to sneak it in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  But if she has said up front, you ain't going there, then at the first word out of his mouth, that's where she [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=500.04s)]
*  slams the gavel. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  Paul, so I want to do a follow up on this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  If you have people who were involved in the January 6 attack who say, I'm here because Donald Trump told me to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=512.76s)]
*  be here. Right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=520.44s)]
*  And then you have some people who are involved in the January 6 attack. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=522.48s)]
*  I'm sure they'll find some witness somewhere who says, no, no, no, the woman next to me was part of Antifa. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=525.04s)]
*  She had a big old ANTI or whatever t-shirt one way or another. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=529.8s)]
*  How would Trump try to sort of circumvent a ruling? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=533.4s)]
*  What's evidence could he potentially bring into the case to have these discussions? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  Or would a ruling by Chuck can mean there's no chance he could bring in that crazy conspiracy theory? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  Judge Shunkin would shut it down because it's not relevant. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  Here's the concern. There's never been a criminal defendant who has the megaphone that Donald Trump has. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=551.52s)]
*  Jack Smith understands that all 12 jurors will have heard a bunch of stuff from and about defendant Trump. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=558.12s)]
*  The only thing Jack Smith can try to control is what they hear in the courtroom. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=567.08s)]
*  Trump has blamed the D.C. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=573.08s)]
*  mayor, the National Guard and the Capitol Police for not stopping the insurrection. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=575.2s)]
*  Jack Smith says that's like a bank robber blaming the security guard at the bank for not [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=581.52s)]
*  stopping the robbery. It's not a defense. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=587.24s)]
*  Even without this motion, again, Judge Shunkin would shut it down if Trump's defense lawyers try to go there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=590.96s)]
*  But this is Jack Smith being proactive. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=597.88s)]
*  Paul, I want to follow up with that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=602.44s)]
*  So one of the things in Smith's filings is he talks about the fact that the government anticipates calling witnesses with [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=603.72s)]
*  knowledge of information protected by certain privileges, including the attorney-client privilege and the speech or debate privilege. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=610.2s)]
*  What does that mean? Are they basically just, is Smith saying, hey, I'm going to bring in some experts because in order to really get to the bottom of this, we're going to have to talk to people that traditionally we couldn't talk to? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  Or is he just sort of laying the framework for how his discussion and how his prosecution will work? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=628.72s)]
*  What does he mean by that in this file? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  Jack Smith is not going to put a person on the witness stand who he's not certain what their testimony will be. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=635.6s)]
*  So this suggests he's got Congress people and he's got lawyers. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=643.16s)]
*  We already know that some of Trump's lawyers have had to be hauled into the grand jury and spilled the beans because there's an exception to the attorney-client privilege when the lawyer is helping the attorney, when the lawyer is helping the defendant even inadvertently commit crime. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=647.12s)]
*  So both Jack Smith and Trump's defense team are planning these epic statements to the jury. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=663.72s)]
*  The opening statement, Jack Smith will talk about Trump's long history of claiming election fraud. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=671.64s)]
*  He'll directly connect Trump to the big lie and the violent assault on the Capitol and the assault on our democracy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=677.68s)]
*  All of that is relevant to the four felonies the jury will consider. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  But to your point, Jason, Donald Trump's team will want the jury to think this is all about President Biden trying to take down his election opponent and that foreign governments interfere with the 2020 election. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  Those are just more of Trump's lies. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=703.84s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=706.48s)]
*  Even if they were true, they have nothing to do with whether Trump is guilty of conspiracy, obstruction and witness tampering. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  Quick question here. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=718.6s)]
*  I just got to ask you this quick. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=719.48s)]
*  Hugo Lowell, who is often a guest here, he says the special counsel doesn't say who, but based on a reporting during the criminal investigation, speech or debate appears to refer to at least one former Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Scott Perry's phone. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=720.84s)]
*  Is this sort of indicating that Mike Pence may actually come and testify against Donald Trump? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=734.72s)]
*  Is that sort of the surprise witness that he may be referring to here? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=742.0s)]
*  And what would be the impact on that very quickly? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=745.32s)]
*  Yeah, so at this point, it's not Mike Pence will be no surprise. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=747.76s)]
*  He'll testify. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think he has speech or debate. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's like Eric Swalwell and other people who were there at the time that this includes and maybe Scott Perry as well, though they're still wrangling over the phone. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=753.48s)]
*  Harry Lipman and Paul Butler, thank you so much for starting us off tonight. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=764.64s)]
*  Coming up, the push to take Donald Trump off the ballot succeeded in Colorado, but fails in Michigan, like Ohio State. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=767.8s)]
*  What it means for the election and what it says about the institutional guardrails in our country next. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  Should Donald Trump be disqualified from running for president for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=788.28s)]
*  Michigan says no. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=793.5999999999999s)]
*  State Supreme Court today upheld a lower court ruling that keeps Trump on the Republican primary ballot there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a true battleground state that was integral to Trump's victory in 2016 and to his loss in 2020. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=802.3599999999999s)]
*  The ruling comes two weeks after Colorado State Supreme Court rocked the political world by tossing Trump off that state's ballot, a ruling that Trump is expected to appeal to the U.S. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  Colorado and Michigan were just two of the 16 states considering challenges to Trump's candidacy under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and its so-called insurrection clause. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=820.52s)]
*  Now, the text of the Constitution seems pretty clear here, but it's being interpreted in 16 states with 16 sets of election laws. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=831.92s)]
*  It's all unfolding in a piecemeal and frankly chaotic way. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=840.16s)]
*  But if you're hoping our last few institutional guardrails will prevent Donald Trump from regaining power, it's starting to look like those legal challenges are not the guardrails we're looking for. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=844.6800000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is Ron Fine, legal director of Free Speech for People, which is the group that filed the challenge to Trump in Michigan and multiple other states. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=855.44s)]
*  Ron, thank you so much for what you're doing and joining us here this evening. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=864.52s)]
*  I want to start with this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=868.72s)]
*  So, you know, Semaphore wrote about you back in September. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=869.92s)]
*  Meet the people who think Trump can be disqualified for running for president. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=872.96s)]
*  You say we would accept a ruling from the Supreme Court, Fine told Semaphore. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=877.76s)]
*  We're not sure that Trump would. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=883.08s)]
*  I think that sort of crystallizes what motivates your organization, right? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=885.84s)]
*  You don't believe that Trump would respect the rule of law if in any shape, way or form he is not put back into the White House in 2024, correct? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=890.64s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Jason. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=900.28s)]
*  And he demonstrated that he doesn't respect the rule of law at the end of 2020 and the beginning of January 2021, culminating on January 6th when he invited a violent horde to swamp the Capitol to attack it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=901.96s)]
*  And where they nearly assassinated the vice president and the speaker of the House, they obstructed Congress and they succeeded for the first time in history of doing something that the Confederacy never even did. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=918.24s)]
*  Which was preventing the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=929.96s)]
*  So, no, Donald Trump doesn't accept rulings from courts, and that's part of what makes him so dangerous. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=932.56s)]
*  So your organization has filed not just in Michigan, but you have filed to get some pro insurrection congressional candidates off the ballot, including Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  You haven't been successful yet. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=950.24s)]
*  Do you think that this is a shot across the bow? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=953.56s)]
*  Do you think that this may be a chilling effect on insurrectionists? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=955.92s)]
*  What do you think is the impact of trying and losing thus far in your attempts to knock insurrections off the ballot? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=960.04s)]
*  Let me be clear about, for example, what the Michigan court just did the other day. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=966.56s)]
*  The Michigan court said it did not say, rather, that Donald Trump didn't engage in insurrection. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=971.04s)]
*  It did not say that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to him. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=977.72s)]
*  It did not say that Michigan or other states can't decide whether he is disqualified under the 14th Amendment. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=981.4s)]
*  All the Michigan court said was that we need to refile that challenge after the primary. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=988.6s)]
*  And that's similar to what happened in Minnesota. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=993.76s)]
*  And this is something that voting rights lawyers are very used to. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=995.92s)]
*  Courts telling you that either you're filing too soon or too late. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=999.8399999999999s)]
*  In this case, we erred on the on the side of filing early before the primary. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1003.04s)]
*  Now the Michigan court is saying that we have to refile after the primary. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1008.56s)]
*  But, of course, by the time that happens, we have challenges in other states pending right now before the Oregon Supreme Court. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  And we will be filing more. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1019.24s)]
*  So like an investor who spreads his bets, we have not put all of our eggs in one basket. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1021.16s)]
*  And although the the Michigan court got it wrong by saying that the challenge can't be filed before the primary, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1028.32s)]
*  we can return to Michigan after the primary and we'll be ready to refile. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1035.7199999999998s)]
*  Ron, I want to ask you sort of a larger philosophical question. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1041.6s)]
*  I think you're probably the perfect person to answer this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1044.08s)]
*  For years, the smart talking head people in Washington, D.C. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1046.52s)]
*  have been telling us, well, we've got guardrails in this country. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1050.8s)]
*  We've got guardrails to prevent these sorts of things from happening. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  The way I'm looking at the country right now, the guardrails have failed. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1057.32s)]
*  They have failed. This is this is a federal official who attempted a violent overthrow of the government. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1060.32s)]
*  And our federal laws don't seem to be doing it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1065.24s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer, but if I had a DUI, I'm disqualified forever working for Uber again. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1067.8s)]
*  I don't understand how you attempted an insurrection. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1073.36s)]
*  You can't just be disqualified. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1076.2s)]
*  Do you feel that the fact that your organization has to go state by state for this challenge, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1078.1200000000001s)]
*  do you feel that that's a failing of our federal guardrails, that it falls to you and an active group of citizens to try and save our country? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1083.52s)]
*  It shouldn't need to fall to us. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1090.48s)]
*  First, the institution that should have taken care of this in the first place was Congress, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1092.48s)]
*  because he was impeached shortly after January 6. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1098.2s)]
*  And of course, that was his second impeachment. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1101.8s)]
*  A majority of the Senate voted to convict him. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1104.44s)]
*  But you need a two thirds super majority. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1107.28s)]
*  And and that fell a little bit short. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1110.4s)]
*  Senator Mitt Romney has recently revealed that many of the Republican senators who voted not to convict him at that time [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1113.2s)]
*  did so because they feared for their own physical safety, because they understood that he and his supporters would threaten them and their families. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1120.96s)]
*  And so the Senate failed in its duty. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1129.48s)]
*  The Department of Justice took too long to initiate criminal prosecutions and investigations. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1132.72s)]
*  And it should not fall to a small democracy oriented nonprofit advocacy group to need to file separate litigation in multiple states. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1138.68s)]
*  But but that's where we are. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1147.56s)]
*  And because other institutions have failed us, that's why we at Free Speech for People will continue filing these actions in state after state. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1148.96s)]
*  And we hope to be able to present a case at trial and demonstrate, as of course was done in Colorado, that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and is disqualified under the U.S. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1158.24s)]
*  Constitution. Ron Fine, thank you so much for the work you're doing. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1170.08s)]
*  You literally are on the front lines of saving our democracy. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1174.48s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us this evening. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1177.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me. Up next, the numbers are in and the MAGA Congress is on course to make history as the least productive house in decades. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1179.36s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett of Texas joins me on that after this quick break. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1189.92s)]
*  It was a history making year in the House of Representatives for all the wrong reasons. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1200.96s)]
*  First, Republicans took 15 ballots just to elect a speaker, the most since the Civil War. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1205.32s)]
*  They made history again when just months later, they ousted that speaker. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1211.28s)]
*  Then the House was effectively shut down for three weeks as Republicans tried and failed over and over and over to choose a new speaker. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1215.68s)]
*  And they finally elected a new speaker. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1224.84s)]
*  One of their first orders of business and highest priorities was to launch a sham impeachment inquiry of President Biden. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1226.52s)]
*  And now there are reports that they could slow walk that investigation, drawing it out during an election year. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1233.8s)]
*  That inquiry is one of the only achievements of this Congress. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1239.56s)]
*  Look at this chart from Axios. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1244.08s)]
*  Using data compiled by the data analytics firm Quorum, it shows that the number of laws passed by each two year congressional session since 1989, hundreds of bills. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1245.76s)]
*  Until you get to right now, halfway through the 118th congressional session. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1256.56s)]
*  See that tiny sliver of red at the end that represents the 20 bills that passed both chambers and became law this year. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1261.0s)]
*  And the additional four bills awaiting President Biden's signature. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1270.56s)]
*  And the vast majority of those bills were pretty minor, like, quote, multiple measures to rename Veterans Affairs clinics and another to mint a coin commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1274.52s)]
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat from Texas who serves on the Oversight Committee and she joins me now. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1288.0s)]
*  Congressman Crockett, it is an honor to speak to you for reasons I'm going to explain when we talk. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1294.0400000000002s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1298.88s)]
*  You are a freshman in Congress, right? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1300.68s)]
*  This is your first time in the job, but you have been a state legislator before. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1303.0s)]
*  Have you been shocked at the lack of productivity and functionality that you've seen in Congress since you got into office? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1308.5600000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. First of all, it's great to see you, Jason. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1316.72s)]
*  And, you know, coming out of one of the craziest sessions in the Texas House as a freshman and then coming to the U.S. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1319.16s)]
*  House, I thought, well, nothing can get crazier. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1327.0s)]
*  But clearly I spoke too soon. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1329.52s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are not serious. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1332.32s)]
*  And at the end of the day, what Democrats need to go ahead and say over and over and over is you can't believe their lying mouths. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  As soon as they talk, a lie is coming out because we can just look at the numbers. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1342.04s)]
*  The data shows that they're not delivering. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1346.44s)]
*  And if you don't want to listen to us or listen to the data, then listen to my good friend, Chip Roy, out of the state of Texas. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  When he says that they have not done anything, we need to make sure that we get serious people elected into office and get this country moving in the proper direction. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1354.24s)]
*  Yeah, to quote one of my favorite shows, these are not serious people. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1364.56s)]
*  And it makes it difficult to do the people's work. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1367.84s)]
*  An example of this, I've got to lay this out. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1370.96s)]
*  So you have the Oversight Committee making one of their priorities heading into 2024, this impeachment into Joe Biden. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1373.2s)]
*  And they're looking for seeking any communications between the White House and lawyers for Hunter Biden about efforts to depose the president's son as part of their impeachment inquiry. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1382.0s)]
*  The GOP chairman said they're seeking to determine whether the president was involved in his son's decision not to comply with Congressional suspicions. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1391.0400000000002s)]
*  Look, I've made it abundantly clear that I don't think that any sort of investigation of the Hunter Biden is really worth the people's time, not when you've got Jared and Ivanka walking around the country. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1397.88s)]
*  But as a member of Congress and being on the Oversight Committee, what's your response when you hear that your colleagues want to spend the people's time investigating Hunter Biden instead of addressing gas prices, inflation, health care, the environment, the kinds of things that people actually want to vote on? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it outrages me. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1426.2s)]
*  And so most of the time when I'm in oversight, you see me get snarky, you see me get passionate. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1428.2s)]
*  And that is because when I was sent to D.C., I was sent to D.C. to work. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1434.96s)]
*  I have a district where 20 percent of my population live at or below poverty. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1439.16s)]
*  They need me to bring real results home because it can be life or death. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1443.68s)]
*  In Texas, we lead an uninsured. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1448.2s)]
*  In North Texas specifically, in my district, we lead in the entire state. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1450.48s)]
*  So we have real issues. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1454.96s)]
*  I didn't campaign on nonsense. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  I campaigned on bettering people's lives. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1458.12s)]
*  That means economically. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1460.56s)]
*  That means in the housing sphere. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1461.96s)]
*  That means in education. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1463.28s)]
*  That means in freedom overall. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1464.72s)]
*  These are the things I campaigned on. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1467.12s)]
*  And so I really want to do the people's work. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1468.96s)]
*  But let me tell you this, Jason, one of the amazing things about coming into this session has been all the amazing work that went into the last session. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  I've been able to just drop off check after check after check. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  I brought home almost two hundred million dollars to my district, not because of anything happened in this session, but because of everything that happened when Joe Biden had a Democratic House as well as the Democratic Senate. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1481.8799999999999s)]
*  So I want to say this, you are the most shared member of Congress amongst my students. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1495.3999999999999s)]
*  You went on the Breakfast Club recently. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1501.0s)]
*  I want to play you some audio from that. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1503.12s)]
*  Get your thoughts on the other side and what your impact might be as a sort of surrogate in 2024. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1505.36s)]
*  Because I feel like you need people like her to be translators, right? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1510.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1514.6s)]
*  Because I've always felt like the messaging from the Democratic Party sucks. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1515.1999999999998s)]
*  That's the nice way of putting it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1520.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1522.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1522.7199999999998s)]
*  She's been able to translate it in a very digestible way for people. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1523.1999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1526.76s)]
*  And, you know, it's just one of those things I say the Democrats love to write a thesis. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1527.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1532.8s)]
*  When really when it comes to the Republicans, they like, uh, what are no cards? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1533.12s)]
*  Like what are Cliff Notes? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1537.12s)]
*  And that's what we need to do. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1538.24s)]
*  People are busy trying to figure out how they're going to keep a roof over their head, keep food in their bellies, keep gas in the car. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1540.04s)]
*  And we're giving out what literally. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1546.3600000000001s)]
*  So, Congressman Crockett, one of the reasons, like I said, that I mentioned that I have my students, I'm a professor at Morgan State University. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1552.32s)]
*  It's HBCU. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1558.52s)]
*  You are actually a member of Congress that my students know of. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1559.92s)]
*  What do you think your role could be in 2024 as a surrogate who actually seems to be able to deliver a message? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1563.32s)]
*  Because one of the biggest reasons for Biden's sort of questionable poll numbers is because young people, especially young black people and people of color, seem to think he doesn't have a message for them. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1569.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1580.44s)]
*  So, first of all, I'm going to do everything that I can to make sure that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are reelected and not necessarily because they're Democrats. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1580.76s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1590.24s)]
*  It has everything to do with democracy in and of itself. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1591.68s)]
*  And I think that I make it plain. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1594.96s)]
*  So many people are trying to make it about the individuals themselves. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1596.88s)]
*  And to be clear, they both have amazing records to run on. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1600.28s)]
*  I don't want to diminish that. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1603.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. But we've got to make sure that when we're telling the stories about their record, that we're telling them in ways that people can understand. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  We also have to make sure that we let people know that Trump is an existential threat to all of us. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1612.16s)]
*  And as I said, when I did that interview, we won't always agree. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1619.36s)]
*  We don't always agree with our spouses. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1623.36s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we don't love them. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1625.6s)]
*  That doesn't mean that they're not going to act in what they believe is our best interest. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  And that is the point right now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1631.32s)]
*  I can tell you, thank God, my district probably doesn't pay attention to every single vote that I make. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1633.12s)]
*  But, you know, I'm sure that somebody disagrees with a vote here and there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1638.9599999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you've got to know that my heart is in the right place and I'm doing everything that I can. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1643.32s)]
*  And that's the exact same thing that we're getting out of the president. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1648.5600000000002s)]
*  You may not agree with everything this administration does, but just know that they are doing their darndest. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1651.64s)]
*  When they tried to deliver on student loan debt, they didn't get to because of what Trump had done, right? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1657.72s)]
*  Because of who he had put on the Supreme Court as he stole seats. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not that they're not trying. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1666.72s)]
*  And I also need people to understand that he's not the president of the world. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1668.6000000000001s)]
*  A president is a president for us of the United States. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1672.68s)]
*  And we have two other branches. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1676.88s)]
*  So y'all need to pay attention to who all is going to be on this team to help this president execute an agenda that we can all live with. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1678.36s)]
*  Very quickly, one of your colleagues that you have often had to put in their place, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1688.12s)]
*  Lauren Boebert, has recently announced that she is going to be running in a different congressional district in 2024. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1692.68s)]
*  I guess they can make her appear there if they say her name three times. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1699.76s)]
*  What do you think that indicates about the fact that, you know, this member of Congress who is a firebrand and insurrectionist often isn't necessarily doing their job now has to flee to another district to possibly get back into Congress? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1703.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that this is the warning sign that the Republicans know they can see what's happening. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1718.44s)]
*  They know that a Lauren Boebert and honestly, it doesn't really matter what Republican you run in that district. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1725.08s)]
*  When we look at the Republicans that are currently sitting in the House, regardless of what they say, they elected unanimously to put Maga Mike at the head of the House. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  So I don't care if they say they're middle ground. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1742.48s)]
*  I don't care if they want to claim that they're not like the Lauren Boebert of the world. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1745.2s)]
*  But they did that along with voting for the impeachment inquiry on Joe Biden, even when people like Ken Buck said there's not enough here. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1750.1200000000001s)]
*  So let me tell you right now, Republicans are all Maga based on their voting record, but they know that a Lauren Boebert cannot win in a swing district. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett, thank you for joining us this evening. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1771.24s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1774.72s)]
*  Thank you. Still ahead, the Biden administration's big push in Mexico on immigration and why the polling keeps favoring Republicans on the border. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1776.48s)]
*  That's next on All In. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1786.0s)]
*  Today, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and other top American officials traveled to Mexico City to meet with the president of Mexico amid a record number of crossings by migrants into the United States at its southern border. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1788.8s)]
*  State Department saying the meeting is due to discuss, quote, unprecedented irregular migration in the Western Hemisphere and identify ways Mexico and the United States will address border security challenges. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1806.44s)]
*  The meeting also comes just over a week after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing local and state police to arrest migrants who they think entered the state from Mexico illegally. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1818.96s)]
*  Immigrant rights groups say the law violates the U.S. Constitution and will encourage racial profiling by police. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1831.6s)]
*  Mexico's president also slammed the new law saying Abbott signed it only because he thinks it will help him become the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2024. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1838.24s)]
*  Maria Hannajosa, a surprise winning journalist, MSNBC polling analyst and the anchor and executive producer of Latino USA. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1847.52s)]
*  Maria, happy holidays. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1855.3999999999999s)]
*  Welcome to All In. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1857.68s)]
*  Great to talk to you. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1858.6s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1860.68s)]
*  It's amazing to me that we see the worst parts of history repeating themselves over and over again. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1862.1599999999999s)]
*  Just talk to us a little bit about not just how bad this new law is that Abbott has signed into law in Texas, but also the fact that didn't we see this already in Arizona about 10 years ago? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1870.4s)]
*  These sort of blanket laws that say that any police officer, if I think you look like a migrant, I can take you in. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  Don't they know that this is going to be struck down or are they hoping the Supreme Court is going to be different? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1888.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, we've been here before. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1893.92s)]
*  Jason, and it's quite distressing. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1895.52s)]
*  I think everybody feels it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1898.68s)]
*  Just this kind of like, are you kidding? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1901.0s)]
*  This is where we're going at this point. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1902.6s)]
*  Sadly, Jason, what needs to happen, because I've been reporting on this issue since 1986, which means that Joe Biden knows everything there is to know about immigration, refugees, migrants. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1904.6s)]
*  He knows all of this. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1916.4s)]
*  There's nothing that is a surprise. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1917.52s)]
*  So what really needs to happen at this moment is to reframe for context, Jason. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1919.88s)]
*  So again, I've been reporting on this for 30 years. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1926.0s)]
*  The American economy, right, has it's grown, it's imploded, but none of it as a result of immigrants, refugees, migrants, none of it are the most recent horrific experiences in our country in terms of massacres have not been committed by [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1929.08s)]
*  immigrants, refugees, migrants, et cetera. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1948.96s)]
*  So the entire country needs to say, hold on a second, this sounds like a broken record. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1952.0s)]
*  It sounds like a constant threat and reframing. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1957.64s)]
*  And that's what's so sad, because the Democrats kind of have it right there. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1960.88s)]
*  I know it's scary to kind of talk about the amazing humanity of these migrants and refugees. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1964.52s)]
*  By the way, Jason, I've been on the ground with them in the caravans, in the jungle, at the border. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1971.2s)]
*  These are the most strategic thinkers, security thinkers. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1978.56s)]
*  People are like, why do you join a caravan to protect their lives? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1984.4s)]
*  That's why. So they're the smartest people out there. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1988.88s)]
*  And we should be welcoming them and figuring out a way because this is what government does, right. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1991.48s)]
*  And international agencies to do it because they want to do it in a in a in a correct way. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=1997.1200000000001s)]
*  In a proper, proper and legal fashion. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2002.76s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2004.92s)]
*  And Maria, this is the concern that I always have. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2006.4s)]
*  Despite the fact that the border issue is primarily affecting only border states, if we look at our national polls, right, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  you see recent NBC poll question from September on immigration says, which party do you think is better at dealing with [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2017.24s)]
*  immigration? And 45 percent of those polls said they think the Republican Party. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2024.28s)]
*  Only 27 percent said the Democratic Party. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2029.0s)]
*  Another key poll, and this is, I think, important to add NBC poll question from September on the single most important issue. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2031.52s)]
*  And they asked what one issue would make you vote for or against a candidate. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  Immigration is third. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2044.0s)]
*  Right. It's not it's not the number one issue. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2045.88s)]
*  So, Maria, my question for you is when you have Republicans who don't seem to have a plan about immigration, you have Democrats [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2048.56s)]
*  who seem to be afraid of developing a plan for immigration. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2056.52s)]
*  And when much of the country's feelings about immigration are driven by racial animus as opposed to actual financial concerns, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you really, really care strongly about immigration in Iowa, I don't know why you're that concerned. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2068.84s)]
*  It's not a border issue for you. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2073.8s)]
*  That's different from somebody in Texas or Arizona, New Mexico. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2074.96s)]
*  What's what's the way forward? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2078.0s)]
*  Because you've been studying this for 30 years. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2079.76s)]
*  Everyone else has been researching this. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2081.52s)]
*  It doesn't seem like we have a policy or even a philosophical way forward with what's happening at our borders. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2083.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2089.16s)]
*  Hmm. What was the administration and who was the president who actually created the last major immigration reform that brought people, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2090.36s)]
*  quote unquote, out of the shadows? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2099.52s)]
*  Right. Because undocumented people are everywhere. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2101.12s)]
*  They look like me and they look like you, Jason. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2103.48s)]
*  So they are everywhere. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2106.08s)]
*  We are everywhere. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2107.2400000000002s)]
*  So who would that be? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2109.2400000000002s)]
*  That would be Ronald Reagan in what is known as Eirke, Immigration Reform and Control Act 1986. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2110.04s)]
*  That was about three million people. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2116.88s)]
*  Let's see. Let's study, as you say, the facts. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2118.68s)]
*  What happened after the Eirke law was passed and immigrants were able to buy homes, buy cars, save for their kids to go to college? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2120.92s)]
*  Oh, did it help the United States economy get out of a recession? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2130.2s)]
*  Actually, it did. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2133.92s)]
*  So what is the way forward is for the Democrats actually to have a brain explosion moment to just say not we haven't been able to do this. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2135.48s)]
*  The Republicans that only talk about building a wall, that's all they've got. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2144.8799999999997s)]
*  They've got to do better. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2149.7999999999997s)]
*  We've got to have a plan. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2152.3599999999997s)]
*  Maria Hinojosa, thank you so much for joining us on All In tonight. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2153.72s)]
*  Much more still ahead, including how to think about the latest polling slump for Joe Biden and the apparent polling bump for Republican buying to defeat Trump. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2159.6s)]
*  That's next on All In with Jason Johnson. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2168.6s)]
*  The 2024 election is upon us. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2175.48s)]
*  It's the silly season. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  In fact, there are just 19 more days until the Iowa caucuses open on January 15th. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2179.0s)]
*  And while President Biden faces no real resistance in the primary, he's facing real headwinds in national polling. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2184.2s)]
*  New Gallup poll last week showed Biden ends 2023 with a 39% job approval rating. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2190.4s)]
*  That's the lowest of any recent president at the same point in their term. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2196.52s)]
*  It's the latest in a series of bad polls for Biden. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2201.3199999999997s)]
*  Even as the economy is going in the other direction, instead of the soft landing, we got a year ending with a stock rally and with inflation trending down. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2204.48s)]
*  And polls still consistently show Biden trailing the top Republican candidate, Donald Trump. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  Even as Trump is facing four criminal trials and doling out fascist and racist rhetoric on the campaign trail. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2218.12s)]
*  Both primary challengers are flailing to find a message in a constituency. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2225.76s)]
*  So what do American voters really want in 2024? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2230.32s)]
*  And what messages are Democrats and Republicans sending them to discuss? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2233.2000000000003s)]
*  Joining me tonight is Alencia Johnson, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior advisor to the Biden 2020 campaign. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2237.6000000000004s)]
*  Tim Miller is the former communications director for the 2016 Jeb Bush campaign and is now a writer at large for the bulwark. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2244.0s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining me this evening. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2250.5200000000004s)]
*  Happy holidays, Alencia. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2252.44s)]
*  I will start with you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2254.44s)]
*  I love this. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2256.48s)]
*  You have people from the left, people from the center left saying, hey, we got to worry. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2257.7999999999997s)]
*  These polls are terrible. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2264.3599999999997s)]
*  You've got James Carville saying Democrats need to wake the bleep up. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2265.72s)]
*  We're in trouble. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2269.48s)]
*  But then you have John Fetterman. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2270.7599999999998s)]
*  And I love what Fetterman says in a recent interview. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2273.2s)]
*  He says, you know, there's a whole lifetime of politics between now and next November. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2275.44s)]
*  I'm not worried about that. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2282.0s)]
*  I'll use this as another opportunity to gel James Carville to shut the bleep up. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2283.2799999999997s)]
*  Alencia, which camp do you fall into? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2289.72s)]
*  Is the sky falling or do we have a year before any of this is a real concern? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2291.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, look, I'm actually kind of in the middle and that two things can be true at the same time. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  Listen, it is we are a year away from the election and voters do have a short attention span. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2301.9599999999996s)]
*  But at the same time, because the polls haven't caught up to the issues that people care about, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2308.2000000000003s)]
*  we do need to be a bit concerned as Democrats, but concerned in a way that shows that we can win. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2314.8s)]
*  2022 and 2023 show that the issues that are part of the Democratic Party platform, as well as the economy, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2320.8s)]
*  those are winning issues for us. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  The hard part for us right now is that the connecting the dots that President Joe Biden is at the top of the ticket. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2330.0s)]
*  He's the leader of the Democratic Party that has the platform that only that not only is working for people around abortion [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2336.04s)]
*  and issues like that, but as you pointed out, the economy is working for folks. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2342.64s)]
*  I was surprised how far gas went down when I pumped gas this holiday weekend to travel down south. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2346.84s)]
*  Right. So we have to close that gap. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2351.88s)]
*  We also want to mention we have to make sure that we're having the real conversation about the Israel Hamas war, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2354.56s)]
*  because that is something that I do not think voters are going to forget about going into the polls. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2360.2s)]
*  But again, I think the mixing bowl of the issues that build the coalition of the Democratic Party as we close the gap [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  and message to people directly on the ground, we've got time as veteran campaign staffer. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2373.36s)]
*  I've been on four presidential campaigns. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2378.36s)]
*  Some didn't work out, but some did. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2380.2799999999997s)]
*  And the ones that did are the ones where we were on the ground talking to voters day to day about the president's record. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2382.16s)]
*  And I think we can do that. We still have time. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2387.2s)]
*  Tim, one of the things and look, personally, I think this is kind of ageist. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2389.12s)]
*  I think it's problematic. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2393.12s)]
*  But one of the things that you consistently see in polls and criticisms of Joe Biden is many Americans seem to think he's too old. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2394.32s)]
*  Well, that's not changing. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2400.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. Joe Biden is not going to not be older next year. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2402.52s)]
*  He gets older every single day. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2406.2000000000003s)]
*  And if that's the kind of thing that's pulling him down in the polls, even if it's unreasonable, we're not we're not judging. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2408.0s)]
*  But it is something that, you know, polling consistently shows. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2413.0s)]
*  What can Democrats do to counter that message? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2416.08s)]
*  And more importantly, why does that never seem to harm Trump? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2419.72s)]
*  I think because Trump is crazier than a you know what house rat. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2424.12s)]
*  And he said that seems to be the bigger problem than his age. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2427.4s)]
*  But I do think that's an issue. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2430.16s)]
*  Look, Joe Biden's got to be out there more. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2432.44s)]
*  He's doing a better job with that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2434.52s)]
*  I think the more he's out there with people, with humans, and you can see the real Joe Biden, I think the better he is, you know, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2436.52s)]
*  staying behind a podium sometimes doing the whisper voice. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2443.72s)]
*  I think he does maybe seem a little bit older. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2447.68s)]
*  And I think that's kind of a problem. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2450.2s)]
*  So that's up to the campaign to put him in situations to seem more vigorous and to have more surrogates out there helping him. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2451.2799999999997s)]
*  But just one other thing, I need to defend my boy James Carville's honor really quick here. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2457.16s)]
*  James Carville wants to win. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2461.3999999999996s)]
*  Got about 30 seconds or less than that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2462.52s)]
*  People are really worried about Donald Trump being the president again. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2464.72s)]
*  And I get that. And I don't think it helps for anybody with any perspective to tell anybody else to STFU. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2467.2799999999997s)]
*  Over this, right? I mean, whether you think the right thing to do is to get behind Joe Biden and defend him 100. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2473.6s)]
*  I get that. If you think the right thing to do is to try to nudge the Democrats to put them in a better position. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2478.56s)]
*  I get that. Like we're all everyone here is in good faith trying to help make sure Donald Trump is not the president again. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2484.04s)]
*  And I appreciate that James Carville is one of those people. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2490.08s)]
*  I get it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2492.3199999999997s)]
*  Alinti Johnson, Tim Miller, thank you so much for coming up on a break. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2493.3199999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2496.68s)]
*  That is all in on this Wednesday night. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2498.48s)]
*  I'm Jason Johnson in for Chris Hayes. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMTk1p6cbvo&t=2501.64s)]
