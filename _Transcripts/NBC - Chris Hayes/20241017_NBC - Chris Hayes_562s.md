# McConnell defends calling Trump ‘despicable human being,' throws Vance under the bus
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are 19 days out from Election Day and the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=0.0s)]
*  Harris-Walls campaign is betting big that there are more Americans who care about and want to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=4.16s)]
*  preserve our democracy than those who don't. And it's because Donald Trump simply cannot stop [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=9.36s)]
*  reminding everyone what happened on January 6, 2021. It might in fact be the moment of his [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=14.88s)]
*  presidency he's most proud of. You had hundreds of thousands of people come to Washington. They [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=20.16s)]
*  didn't come because of me. They came because of the election. They thought the election was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=26.96s)]
*  a rigged election and that's why they came. Some of those people went down to the Capitol. I said [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  peacefully and patriotically. Nothing done wrong at all. Nothing done wrong. And action was taken, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=36.4s)]
*  strong action. Ashley Babbitt was killed. Nobody was killed. There were no guns down there. We [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  didn't have guns. The others had guns, but we didn't have guns. And when I say we, these are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=48.8s)]
*  people that walked down, this was a tiny percentage of the overall which nobody sees and nobody shows. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=53.36s)]
*  But that was a day of love. That was Trump's answer when he was asked explicitly by the man [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=60.0s)]
*  you saw on the left part of your screen, an undecided voter, to win his vote back by apologizing, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=67.92s)]
*  essentially, for the January 6 insurrection in a town hall yesterday. We didn't have the guns, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  he said. The others had guns. Now, first of all, there were Trump supporters with guns at the Capitol. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=79.68s)]
*  We know that now. Setting that aside, notice how he structures that sentence. He's referring to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  the violent mob and the rioters and the people that assaulted police officers as we. His people, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=92.0s)]
*  his team, the guys who desecrated the Capitol and ransacked offices and chanted hang mike pence [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=97.76s)]
*  and brutally bashed the heads in of cops. That's the we. We, the others, the other side, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=103.52s)]
*  the other team with guns, the ones on the other side, those, well, who was that? Well, those were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=110.88s)]
*  the cops who defended the Capitol and our constitutional republic itself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=116.16s)]
*  Trump has declared the two teams here, him and the rioters on one, the rest of us on the other. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Because again, he agrees with what the rioters did. He wishes they'd been successful. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=127.28s)]
*  Today, Kamala Harris issued a direct rebuttal to those very remarks to voters in Wisconsin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  So now we here know January 6 was a tragic day. It was a day of terrible violence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=140.88s)]
*  There were attacks on law enforcement. 140 law enforcement officers were injured. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=149.36s)]
*  Some were killed. And what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=157.76s)]
*  He called it a quote, a day of love. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=167.44s)]
*  But it points out something that everyone here knows. The American people are exhausted with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  his gaslighting. Exhausted with his gaslighting. Enough! Harris knows that voters correctly find [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=184.48s)]
*  what happened on January 6th indefensible. Majorities do. Trump and his fellow Republicans [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  are doing everything they can to make voters forget about it. This is really central, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, his handpicked Supreme Court certainly helped enormously by granting his ludicrous request [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  for total immunity and intentionally making sure that the criminal January 6 case got delayed past [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=209.68s)]
*  the election. Republican politicians who were at the Capitol during the insurrection not forgotten, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=215.44s)]
*  at least not privately, those people know what he did was despicable. And I use that word [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=221.52s)]
*  despicable specifically because it is how Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell refers to Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  According to a new book amid Trump's efforts to overturn the election, McConnell called him [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  a despicable human being, stupid and ill-tempered. McConnell also apparently sobbed to his staff [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=238.0s)]
*  after the insurrection and he privately lamented that Trump should have to pay a price for the attack. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=245.36s)]
*  Mitch McConnell isn't denying his disparaging comments about his party's current nominee for [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=251.52s)]
*  president. Whatever I may have said about President Trump pales in comparison to what J.D. Vance, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, and others have said about him, but we are all on the same team now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=259.92s)]
*  And he is right about that because as Donald Trump, to his credit, pointed out, there are two teams here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  There is the team that wants to preserve American democracy and the rule of law, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=274.16s)]
*  and there is the team trying to overturn it. For Donald Trump, that's we versus the others. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=279.04s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is with the we. He is part of the same despicable team as Donald Trump. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Don't forget, Mitch McConnell ran the Senate during Trump's second impeachment after January 6th, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=292.4s)]
*  and he very well could have whipped votes to convict Trump, and had he done so and had been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=296.56s)]
*  successful, it would have removed him from the possibility of public office. He couldn't have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  run again. And McConnell chose not to do that. And now Trump is running again, and McConnell is right [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=304.56s)]
*  by his side. I think the biggest hope I have is that voters do remember how terrible January 6th [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  was, because remember, in the hours and days and weeks after the attack, it really did feel like [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=318.16s)]
*  Trump might finally be finished. Look at this graph. I think about this graph all the time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  This shows Trump's favorability throughout his four years as president. The orange line is his [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  disapproval rating. Most are majority disapproving most of the time. Green line is his approval [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=332.48s)]
*  rating. See how it reaches its lowest point ever at the very end there? January 2021, the immediate [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=336.16s)]
*  aftermath of the violent insurrection that he led, his favorability ratings were nearly 20 points [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=344.8s)]
*  underwater. What Trump did that day, sitting idly by while his supporters tried to end American [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=350.08s)]
*  democracy and in fact encouraging them, is disqualifying. Listen to how Trump's longtime [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=357.92s)]
*  friend, billionaire Robert Kraft put it. Donald Trump became a social friend [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=364.8s)]
*  Donald Trump became a social friend [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=371.2s)]
*  in the early 90s when I was going down to Florida. And then when my wife of blessed memory died [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=376.24s)]
*  13 years ago, he was one of four or five people who reached out to me and was really, really nice. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=383.44s)]
*  I was very upset what happened January 6th. He led an insurrection in his country? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=392.0s)]
*  Pardon? I think he led an insurrection in his country. And I haven't talked to him since then. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=398.64s)]
*  After January 6th, Republicans understood what Trump did was a disaster, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=404.96s)]
*  both morally and politically. Remember, even his friends on Fox News admitted as much privately. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=408.8s)]
*  Quote, Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=416.24s)]
*  He is destroying his legacy, Laura Ingraham wrote. Please get him on TV, destroying everything you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=424.56s)]
*  have accomplished, Brian Kilmeade texted. Quote, can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=434.56s)]
*  Capitol, Sean Hannity urged. Now, he didn't want to do that at the time because he was too busy [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=443.2s)]
*  watching it and eating and hoping that the rioters were victorious. Now, those very same folks, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=449.2s)]
*  the same individuals quoted there in the Republican Party and on Fox, they are working night and day [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=456.08s)]
*  to just wipe your memories, actively collaborating with this despicable human being by covering up [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=461.68s)]
*  his despicable plan to end the American Republic as we know it. They don't want you to think about [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=467.52s)]
*  the horrors of January 6th while you're filling out your ballot. Just listen to JD Vance today. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=475.2s)]
*  The media loves to talk about January the 6th and of course, January the 6th of 2021, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=481.76s)]
*  if you were violent, if you committed acts of violence, then you should be prosecuted for them. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=487.44s)]
*  Everybody believes that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Does everyone believe that JD? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  Because Donald Trump thinks it was a day of love. He refers to himself as part of the mob. And by [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=498.88s)]
*  the way, promising to pardon the violent rioters, if he wins, he will do it on day one. The biggest [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=503.04s)]
*  obstacle for folks like Vance and Laura Ingraham and Mitch McConnell, all these people want to just, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  you know, make you forget it all. The biggest obstacle to their plan is Donald Trump himself, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=515.2s)]
*  who absolutely refuses to run away from what he did on January 6th because he is proud of it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=521.52s)]
*  He wants to do it again. He's trying to do it again. He keeps saying so out loud. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=527.2s)]
*  The only silver lining is that his pride in his despicable actions may end up being his own downfall. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUEfhxCECY&t=534.0s)]
