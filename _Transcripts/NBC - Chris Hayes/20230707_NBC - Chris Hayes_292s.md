# ‘Disastrous’: Ron DeSantis at risk of becoming the Ted Cruz of 2024
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI)
*  There are those that say there's something about you that's not connecting for whatever reason not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Connecting with the voter whether or not be personality Donald Trump says it's about loyalty [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=5.64s)]
*  Francis Suarez says it's about your relationships and it's not about those individuals so much is I'm curious in the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Analysis of Ron DeSantis of why not yet is connecting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=16.98s)]
*  Well, I think did you just see the news today about the record fundraising hall we've had nobody's been able to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=23.76s)]
*  Match that in the history of modern presidential politics [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=30.08s)]
*  Okay, a few things now to be fair Ron DeSantis [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=34.52s)]
*  It's an impossible question posed by Fox News fill-in hosts last night who has had his own troubles connecting the past [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=38.1s)]
*  There's no good way for any politician to answer like what's wrong with you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=44.0s)]
*  Why don't people like you and yet it's a consistent genre of campaign questions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=48.68s)]
*  But that really is not the kind of question a candidate wants to be hearing at this point in the campaign [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=53.44s)]
*  And on that front DeSantis really does only have himself to blame for being in this position pulling [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=58.48s)]
*  30 points behind Donald Trump six weeks after formally launching his bid for president [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  The Florida governor has made a career out of being the far right-wing king [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=68.92s)]
*  From the sent don't say gay law to banning trans health care in the state of Florida and banning abortion after six weeks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=73.16s)]
*  It's shipping migrants out of the state possibly in what some believe was a criminal scheme [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=79.12s)]
*  DeSantis has positioned himself as the hardest core member of the MAGA army and while that may get him Eric time on Fox [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it has I don't think it's broadly popular among the general population general elector [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=91.48s)]
*  electorate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=97.76s)]
*  But also there's a precedent here. He should think of because others have tried this exact same model before and it failed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  spectacularly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=107.44s)]
*  Do you remember the disastrous presidential campaign of one Texas Senator Ted Cruz? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=108.76s)]
*  2016 he tried to run on his record as well for lack of a better way of phrasing it an extreme conservative jerk [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=115.64s)]
*  In his very first year in office Cruz helped engineer a pointless government shutdown [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=122.96s)]
*  He alienated members of his own party and fueled punchlines with his antics including a secret meeting at a Tex-Mex [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=127.56s)]
*  Restaurant called tortilla coast and a dramatic reading of dr. Seuss during a marathon filibuster [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=135.0s)]
*  Sam I am that Sam I am that Sam I am I do not like that Sam I am [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=142.28s)]
*  Do you like green eggs and ham I do not like them Sam I am I do not like green eggs and ham [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=152.04s)]
*  Cruz went on to stake out the furthest right positions on everything from immigration to gay marriage [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=159.74s)]
*  Calling the landmark Supreme Court ruling on marriage quote among the darkest hours of our nation and on climate change [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  Cruz went so far to the right. He basically fell off the edge of his flat earth [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  The satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  Now that's a real problem for the global warming alarmist today [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  The global warming alarmist are the equivalent of the flat earthers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=188.61999999999998s)]
*  You know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=193.06s)]
*  The earth is flat and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=196.26s)]
*  The satellite data, how's that holding up? No warming. You think there's no warming happening? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  So that was the 2016 version of the Ronda Santas playbook be as obnoxiously right-wing as possible [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  And yes Cruz did eke out a win in Iowa. Do we all remember that? He won Iowa and he took on Carly Fiorina as a running mate [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=213.1s)]
*  And he did look like a contender sort of for a little while [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=219.42s)]
*  But in the end, how did the obnoxious far-right act work out for Ted? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=223.98s)]
*  Nasty guy now. I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=229.18s)]
*  And I think I'll say sayonara if you ever got the nomination I'm beginning to get a little nervous [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=237.34s)]
*  I'm beginning to understand why Ted Cruz has been hated by everyone every place he's ever been from kindergarten to the United States Senate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=241.74s)]
*  If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate and the trial was in the Senate, nobody could get you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=250.22s)]
*  He is lying Ted. It's L-Y-I-N apostrophe lying Ted. Once again lying Ted! [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=258.22s)]
*  Sir, America is a better country. Without you [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsYTwbBdvI&t=266.22s)]
