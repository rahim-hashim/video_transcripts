# 'Kryptonite issue': Republicans flail in the wake of the Alabama IVF ruling
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ)
*  At least three fertility clinics in Alabama have now paused in vitro fertilization, or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=0.0s)]
*  IVF, after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos in a lab have the same [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=5.8s)]
*  rights as children, the fallout sending shockwaves throughout the state and sending Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=11.28s)]
*  politicians scrambling. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=16.84s)]
*  You see, IVF is extremely popular. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=18.92s)]
*  I mean extremely popular. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=21.72s)]
*  As Kellyanne Conway's own polling firm found, 86% of all voters support access to IVF, including [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=23.8s)]
*  78% of self-identified pro-life advocates and 83% of evangelical Christians. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=31.72s)]
*  So it's no wonder Nikki Haley is now desperately trying to backpedal after agreeing with the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=39.44s)]
*  Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos are babies. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=44.08s)]
*  Today she says IVF should still be available. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=47.68s)]
*  As if there's one place Republican politicians do not want to be in an election year, it's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=51.48s)]
*  on the losing side of a very popular issue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=57.0s)]
*  Tara Setmayer worked as a GOP communications director on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  She is now a senior advisor for the Lincoln Project. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=64.08s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=67.34s)]
*  Tara, it is so good to have you here tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=68.34s)]
*  I want to play for you a little bit of Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville on that ruling. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=71.0s)]
*  Do you have a reaction to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on the fact that embryos are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=78.56s)]
*  children? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=83.48s)]
*  Yeah, I was all for it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=84.48s)]
*  We need to have more kids. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=85.48s)]
*  We need to have an opportunity to do that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=86.48s)]
*  And I thought this was the right thing to do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=88.4s)]
*  IVF is used to have more children and right now IVF services are paused at some of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  clinics in Alabama. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=94.6s)]
*  Aren't you concerned that this could impact people who are trying to have kids? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=95.6s)]
*  Well, that's for another conversation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=99.72s)]
*  I think that conversation is now, Tara. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=103.64s)]
*  How is this Alabama ruling and the threat to IVF roiling the Republican politics as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=106.12s)]
*  you see it right now? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=110.76s)]
*  Well, the idiocy of Senator Tuberville is palpable and just extraordinary at times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  It's not the only time he's sounded like an absolute moron and he's paid for by the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=118.56s)]
*  taxpayers of Alabama. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Listen, this is another example of a kryptonite issue for Republicans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  They know that the majority of the American people are pro-choice and the overwhelming [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=132.8s)]
*  majority of people are pro-IVF, including their own constituents in the Republican Party, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=138.22s)]
*  including the evangelicals who overwhelmingly support IVF. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=144.84s)]
*  There have been eight million babies born through IVF in this country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=150.36s)]
*  So according to this Alabama Supreme Court ruling, I guess then all of those babies and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=156.24s)]
*  all of those families who have had the gift of life thanks to this technology should not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=161.98s)]
*  have been born. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=166.66s)]
*  And all of those people who are looking forward to having children that suffer from infertility, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=168.02s)]
*  which is over six million women in this country, they just shouldn't have that opportunity. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=172.82s)]
*  Republicans do not want to have this discussion because if I'm the Democrats, I'm coming [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  out and showcasing all of the families in my district or state or in a national election [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=187.18s)]
*  that have had successful IVF pregnancies and say to them, I challenge Republicans to say [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=195.34s)]
*  that these children shouldn't have had an opportunity at life. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the extremism now is really beginning, I think, to sink in for some people, particularly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=206.02s)]
*  women across this country who feel as though they are under attack. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=214.06s)]
*  And they are. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  The rights of women in this country are under attack daily. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=219.06s)]
*  And the Republican Party is at the helm of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=222.9s)]
*  And you had yesterday Nikki Haley saying that she agreed with the Alabama Supreme Court [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=225.94s)]
*  that embryos are children, but later on trying to clarify her remarks, announcing IVF should [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=230.78s)]
*  be available. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  What are your thoughts on, as an example, to your point, this is a space Republicans [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  just don't want to be in? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, Nikki Haley flip-flopping on an issue and having to backpedal and then explain again, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=247.18s)]
*  it's just another day that ends in why. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=251.18s)]
*  This is part of the weakness of her candidacy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=252.9s)]
*  And this is coming from someone who used artificial reproductive technology to have her own child. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=256.1s)]
*  So these people are just unbelievable at times. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm glad that we're pointing this out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=266.06s)]
*  She knows that this is not an issue they want to argue. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=268.7s)]
*  She knows that the idea of banning IVF is out of the mainstream. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=272.5s)]
*  So she had to clarify. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=276.26s)]
*  She was trying to cater to Republican primary voters who are on the extreme, out of the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=277.66s)]
*  mainstream on this, and then realize, oh, wait a minute, that's not the right answer. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=283.1s)]
*  So I need to keep myself honest in this and clarify. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=287.94s)]
*  Look, Republican strategists across the country know that the abortion issue, the women's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=292.94s)]
*  rights issue, is a losing one for them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=297.46s)]
*  And there are over a dozen states that have abortion on the ballot this year for referendums. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=300.29999999999995s)]
*  And in those swing states where the abortion issue comes up, places like Michigan, Arizona, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=305.61999999999995s)]
*  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, they do not want to have women coming out in large numbers, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  particularly Republican women, pro-choice women, and voting as single issue voters on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=317.74s)]
*  this because that could swing the election for Democrats. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=322.94s)]
*  Republicans know this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=326.18s)]
*  That's why Kellyanne Conway put that memo out trying to tell them, hey, guys, you don't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=327.18s)]
*  want this issue front and center. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  You don't want to go here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=333.5s)]
*  It's a loser for us, and it should be. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=334.5s)]
*  Women's rights should not be under attack in 2024. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  This is not an episode of the Handmaid's Tale. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=341.18s)]
*  But if you empower these people and let them get voted into office, it will be. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=343.8s)]
*  Tarasette Mayer, always bringing it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=347.8s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tara. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3hnpwU4tQ&t=352.28000000000003s)]
