Video Description: “We thought there was certainly a strong body of evidence the department should consider – but having been a federal prosecutor myself, they are going to look for what is the most provable, strongest case,” says Congressman Adam Schiff. “And he’s been very conservative in the charging of Mar-a-Lago. I think he’ll be conservative in the charging around January 6th if indeed he brings charges against the former president.”

# Special counsel eyes second Trump indictment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I)
*  You can reasonably disagree with how our government executes the responsibilities we have given it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=0.0s)]
*  But that is very different from saying we're no longer going to allow our political opponents [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=6.16s)]
*  to participate in the process. That is the Trump model. We're going to participate in elections the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=10.4s)]
*  way we always have until the way we've always done things stops working for me and then we're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=16.72s)]
*  going to change the rules to stay in power. It's the exact same playbook that autocrats have been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=21.12s)]
*  using to try and end free and fair elections throughout human history. Very few issues in life [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=26.88s)]
*  are actually black or white binary but this one actually is. Either you are a supporter of free [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  and fair elections and representative democracy and you think that Donald Trump's attempts to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=38.4s)]
*  end those things was a grave dangerous crime that cannot go unpunished or you simply do not really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=42.72s)]
*  believe in democracy after all. Which is why we need to call out the elected Republicans who are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  tying themselves into knots to defend Trump's indefensible conduct. It's absolutely anti-democratic [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=54.64s)]
*  and there's absolutely no reason to do it. You simply don't have to support Donald Trump on this [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=61.92s)]
*  one. It's the wrong thing to do. When you say what Trump did wasn't really that bad or call the whole [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=66.8s)]
*  process a witch hunt you're tacitly supporting the attempted theft of democracy. Every person living [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=72.0s)]
*  in this country is protected from tyranny only by our shared belief and support of our democratic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=78.32s)]
*  institutions. Your ability to have a say in the way your government is run only exists when the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=84.8s)]
*  political system actually functions the way it is supposed to. Donald Trump tried to undo that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=90.96s)]
*  So the threat is existential at this point. It does not matter if you care more about abortion [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  or inflation or crime or the climate. You lose your say in how we collectively tackle any of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=103.44s)]
*  those issues when you lose your say in the democratic process. And by defending Donald Trump in this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=110.56s)]
*  particular circumstance that is what a whole bunch of people are signaling that they're on board with. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=116.72s)]
*  That's why this has to be sorted out now in a court of law because if we lose this fight there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  may never be another chance to try again. I know that sounds hyperbolic but it's true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=128.72s)]
*  American democracy itself is actually at stake in a way it reminds me of the now iconic closing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=134.24s)]
*  argument that Congressman Adam Schiff made during the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=140.64s)]
*  If right doesn't matter we're lost. If the truth doesn't matter we're lost. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=146.72s)]
*  If the truth doesn't matter we're lost. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=154.72s)]
*  Framers couldn't protect us from ourselves if right and truth don't matter. Here right is supposed to matter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=157.44s)]
*  It's what's made us the greatest nation on earth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=166.48s)]
*  No constitution can protect us. Right doesn't matter anymore. And you know [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=171.04s)]
*  you can't trust this president do what's right for this country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=178.56s)]
*  You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump. Congressman Adam Schiff is a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=184.88s)]
*  Democrat of California. He was the lead impeachment manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=192.16s)]
*  you just heard. He sat on the January 6th committee. He currently is a candidate for the United States [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=196.72s)]
*  Senate and he joins me now. Congressman good to see you this evening. Thank you for being with us. I want [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=201.2s)]
*  to go back to that speech that you made. Here right matters is also the title of of Alexander [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=205.36s)]
*  Vindman's book. Vindman of course kicked off the whole impeachment by reporting the phone call to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=211.68s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky the extortionate phone call. And he used the term in his testimony because he was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=216.24s)]
*  trying to reassure his father who had come from from Ukraine and earlier from Russia that that's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  okay dad don't worry about me because I'm here in America where right counts for something. Right [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=228.08s)]
*  matters. His whole point was in America they make a distinction between right and wrong. He was [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  saying that that's what our democracy is but what Donald Trump is saying is that's not really true. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=238.8s)]
*  You're absolutely right. I use that because it's such a powerful idea. It's really core to who we [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  are as a country. And you know sadly and you're so right to point this out what has allowed Donald [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump to put our democracy on such fragile ground to tear down and tear out so many of our institutions [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=258.72s)]
*  is the willing enablers in the U.S. Congress. The people like Kevin McCarthy who were saying this is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=265.76s)]
*  all about Donald Trump's position in the polls. There's nothing to do with justice. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Every time you hear one of the Republican leaders say things like that which they know to be false [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=276.88s)]
*  they're basically saying right doesn't matter in this country. What's lawful doesn't matter [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=282.64s)]
*  in this country. The only thing that matters is obtaining power and keeping power. You know I think [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=286.55999999999995s)]
*  we are where we are because people haven't given meaning to their oath of office. They haven't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=293.44s)]
*  informed that oath with ideas of right and wrong. They're unwilling to accept the basic truth or [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  even that there is something called fact for the Republican leadership. It's just about power. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=303.44s)]
*  You sat on the January 6th committee as well which recommended that Donald Trump and others [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=309.36s)]
*  be charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. That is now what we believe to be in that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=313.12s)]
*  target letter. The idea that that charge may exist. What do you make of that and why is that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=319.6s)]
*  important? What is this conspiracy to defraud the United States about? Well it's about conspiring [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=324.24s)]
*  with others to deprive them of their vote to perpetrate a fraud on the country that the person [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  who actually lost the election somehow should be declared the winner. And I was you know very [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=337.36s)]
*  interested to see also reporting that they are going after the the video tape in state that the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=342.56s)]
*  state farm arena in Georgia. That will be relevant to prosecutors looking into that phone call of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=349.04s)]
*  Donald Trump where he's badgering the top elections officials to find 11,780 votes that don't exist. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=355.04s)]
*  If the president is involved in trying to defraud voters in Georgia and as George is a swing state, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=362.16s)]
*  defraud voters all over the United States of America, that's obviously a very serious crime. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=369.68s)]
*  And I'm glad that the special counsel is you know moving on these issues. It took them a long time [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=375.68s)]
*  at the Justice Department to get started on anybody but those who broke into the Capitol that day. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=382.0s)]
*  But it does seem like the investigation is coming to its conclusion and I have to hope that the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=387.36s)]
*  former president and others will be held responsible. Now one of the things that your committee recommended [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  were charges of aiding and insurrection. Our reporting at the moment does not indicate that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=398.48s)]
*  that's being included. Tell me what your thoughts are on that being left out of these these potential [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=404.08s)]
*  charges. Well I think certainly the former president's involvement in inciting that attack [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  on the Capitol, a powerful evidence such as on January 6th when he's told that there's a problem [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=417.2s)]
*  with the metal detectors but it's not the usual problem. The problem on January 6th wasn't that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=422.96s)]
*  there were long lines at the metal detectors, it was that there were practically no lines because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  people wouldn't go through them because they didn't want their weapons taken away. And what [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=432.88s)]
*  is Donald Trump's response? Then take down the effing mags. They're not here to hurt him. And [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=437.52s)]
*  you know this is powerful evidence of his involvement in the incitement, his knowledge [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=444.56s)]
*  that these people are armed in dangers, and the failure to do anything during the attack. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=450.0s)]
*  You know the statute also prevents giving aid and comfort to people who commit instruction. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=456.0s)]
*  So we thought there were there was certainly a strong body of evidence the department should [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=460.64s)]
*  consider. But you know having been a federal prosecutor myself, they're going to look for [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=464.8s)]
*  what is the most provable strongest case. And he's been very conservative in the charging in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=470.4s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. I think he'll be conservative in the charging around January 6th if indeed he brings [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=476.32s)]
*  charges against the former president. So the the conspiracy part of defrauding the United States [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  government, that's important because that's the that's what the government's role was. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=486.64s)]
*  There's another charge in there, the deprivation of rights under the color of law. It's not [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=491.12s)]
*  something that'll be familiar to a lot of people, but this has to do with the idea of actually [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  undermining the vote. Well I think that's right and it could be very much the flip side of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  conspiracy to defraud. That is if you deprive a person of their vote, and you could deprive a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=506.88s)]
*  person of their vote by saying their vote shouldn't be counted. The president was obviously [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=514.08s)]
*  trying to stop the counting after election day because he knew the absentee ballots would run [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  against him. But also trying to get you know state elections officials to count votes that didn't [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=522.32s)]
*  exist also has the effect of undermining the the real votes of the American people. And so it does [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  injure two voters. That could be the the prosecution's theory, or it could be you know the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  president's actions in threatening the lives of elections officials, depriving them of their right [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=542.24s)]
*  to do their jobs as poll workers, as elections officials you know unmolested and without the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=548.64s)]
*  the fear of death. So there are a number of ways I think that the the facts could support such a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=554.72s)]
*  charge, but we will have to wait and see indeed whether there are charges and if this particular [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=561.36s)]
*  statute is used. Yeah and again we don't know. We this is some reporting we've got, but we don't [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=566.96s)]
*  know until we see that target letter. What's your sense of whether or not these charges as [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=571.36s)]
*  they are being discussed right now, these potential charges reflect the gravity of what Donald Trump [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=575.04s)]
*  did? You made the point that Jack Smith might be conservative about this because he needs a case [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=579.76s)]
*  to actually prove and hopefully one that doesn't drag into 2025. Does it reflect for the for the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=583.84s)]
*  viewer for the American public the gravity of what Donald Trump did? Well I certainly hope that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=590.32s)]
*  whatever charges are brought does reflect the gravity, but I also completely agree with you [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=597.28s)]
*  Ali that this is this is the most serious set of potential charges. Mar-a-Lago is very serious. It [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=602.56s)]
*  threatened the nation's security. The charges in New York are also serious. Committing multiple [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=609.6s)]
*  acts of business fraud is no laughing matter, but here you're talking about charges going to the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=616.16s)]
*  heart of our democracy. Charges involving the first effort to essentially prevent the peaceful [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=622.08s)]
*  transfer power in our history. So any charges regarding January 6th I think by definition are [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  going to be the most serious charges against Donald Trump. All right, well good to see you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  Thanks again for being with us tonight. The congressman Adam Schiff of California. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=638.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-gmoTjpQ5I&t=652.08s)]
