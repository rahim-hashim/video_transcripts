# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Feb. 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE)
*  Good evening from Washington, D.C. I'm Michael Steele in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=0.0s)]
*  As a real estate developer, Donald Trump loved to put his name on OPP, other people's buildings. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=5.04s)]
*  Now he's about to pull off a similar rebranding on the Republican National Committee and it's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=11.46s)]
*  going to end up pretty much like his failed Atlantic City casino. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=16.3s)]
*  After forcing one-time ally, Ronald McDaniel, out as RNC chair, Trump endorsed his own daughter-in-law [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=20.52s)]
*  for co-chair. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=27.12s)]
*  Today, Laura Trump spoke at CPAC, laying out her plan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=28.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I come bearing good news here today because less than nine months [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=33.36s)]
*  away from changing all that, we will see Donald J. Trump elected as the 47th president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=39.0s)]
*  By going all in on his capitulation to Trump, the party of fiscal responsibility is making [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=46.0s)]
*  an atrocious investment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=51.14s)]
*  Trump's rise has led to a diminished Republican party, electorally, financially, and infidelity [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=53.68s)]
*  to conservative values. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=59.68s)]
*  Trump has led the Republican party on an embarrassing losing streak, despite promises the GOP would [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=61.72s)]
*  quote, get tired of winning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=66.8s)]
*  A few things to keep in mind. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=69.4s)]
*  The party is losing money, ending last year with its lowest fundraising totals in a decade. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=71.28s)]
*  Laura Trump has not ruled out paying her father-in-law's mounting legal bills. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=77.32s)]
*  Donald Trump is the ultimate rhino. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, he's a rhino, Republican in name only, because as president, Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=84.16s)]
*  abandoned free trade, racked up huge deficits, and cozied up to authoritarians. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=88.8s)]
*  And for nearly a decade, the Republican party has been consumed by Trump's chaos, division, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=94.4s)]
*  grifters, and conspiracy theories. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=100.0s)]
*  Now it appears this once great party wants more of the same. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=102.76s)]
*  Yeah, so much for winning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=107.0s)]
*  I'm joined now by Sabrina Siddiqui, a White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  McKay Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic, and Lucy Caldwell, veteran Republican strategist [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  who served as campaign manager for former Illinois congressman and my buddy, Joe Walsh. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you all for being here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=123.88s)]
*  So Lucy, I want to begin with you on this one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=124.96s)]
*  Could you give us some sense, just some inkling of a sense, of how Donald Trump managed this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=128.4s)]
*  complete takeover of the RNC now? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=134.16s)]
*  And what it says about the party currently and going forward. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=137.12s)]
*  Well, Michael, of course, you know about this better than anyone, based on your own record. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=143.08s)]
*  And you know by your own record that this is really something's gone wrong. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=147.6s)]
*  After Donald Trump became president, he did something kind of unprecedented. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=151.96s)]
*  He actually went about systematically removing state party chairs throughout the country, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=155.1s)]
*  really shoring up the committee to make sure that, like his base, it was full of loyalists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=160.0s)]
*  I think it's easy in an episode like this to lose sight of what it is that a national [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=166.0s)]
*  party does. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=170.0s)]
*  What does the Republican National Committee do or what is it supposed to do? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=171.0s)]
*  It's supposed to recruit candidates, you know, create data and technology resources for candidates. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=174.44s)]
*  It's supposed to build up volunteer bases. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=181.16s)]
*  It's supposed to create infrastructure to make it easier for candidates to win, to recruit [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=183.5s)]
*  high quality candidates, to make them successful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=188.36s)]
*  In the Trump era, we've seen that the Republican committee is focused on doing the opposite. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=191.26s)]
*  And as Laura Trump herself said this week, now they're even contemplating paying Donald [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=195.52s)]
*  Trump's legal bills. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  That would be, you know, sort of in line with Trump doing things like using campaign funds [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  to pay a quarter of a million dollars a year to his wife's hairstylist. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=204.2s)]
*  So it's true that behind the scenes, maybe they have a slightly more serious person in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=208.12s)]
*  Michael Watley, who's the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, who is Trump's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=211.56s)]
*  pick for chair. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=215.64s)]
*  But Laura Trump should be nowhere near the co-chairship of the RNC. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=217.28s)]
*  And I never thought I would say this, but I think her talents would actually be better [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=220.52s)]
*  spent recording covers of Tom Petty songs, and she's not very good at that either. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=223.72s)]
*  Well, there is that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=228.0s)]
*  Sabrina, I think there are a couple of interesting points here, particularly around the money [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=230.24s)]
*  piece. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=235.16s)]
*  I mean, given where the party is financially right now, what have you discovered from your [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=236.16s)]
*  reporting or learning from your reporting about whether or not the party is actually [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=240.68s)]
*  going to go through with paying these bills? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=244.44s)]
*  Can they really afford to pay the bills and win elections? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=246.16s)]
*  Well, the RNC certainly does not have the money to pay former President Trump's legal [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=249.24s)]
*  bills. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=253.84s)]
*  You know, one of the main problems that they've had is that a lot of donors have not actually [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=254.84s)]
*  been willing to cut large checks to the RNC, in part because they don't want that money [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=259.96s)]
*  going to former President Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=265.42s)]
*  And so I don't think that Laura Trump's comments are going to help with their fundraising capabilities, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  at least with a faction of Republican donors, because that is a big concern, that money [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=274.24s)]
*  is going to be used for his extensive legal bills rather than propping up other Republican [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=280.28s)]
*  candidates and just the broader pursuit, not just of taking back the White House, but also [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  of gains in Congress. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=292.84s)]
*  But we've seen this trumpification of the entire Republican political apparatus that's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=295.36s)]
*  been really years in the making. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=301.44s)]
*  Fielty to Trump has actually been a hallmark of the RNC, even under its soon to be outgoing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=303.8s)]
*  leadership. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=309.4s)]
*  I mean, Ronna McDaniel really took every possible step to appease former President Trump, now [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=310.4s)]
*  candidate Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=316.4s)]
*  It was just that she went on withholding the debates. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=317.4s)]
*  That was one of the sort of, and didn't maybe do enough in his eyes to go after what he [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=320.32s)]
*  said was election fraud, and we all know was actually a lie, and a free and fair election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=327.56s)]
*  So I don't think that no matter what the RNC says about paying or not paying his legal [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  bills or the Trump campaign suggesting that they won't use RNC to pay his legal bills, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=337.16s)]
*  I think we know that the RNC and all of the Republican political apparatus would very [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=341.6s)]
*  much be used to do whatever Trump tells them to do. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  At least three fertility clinics in Alabama have now paused in vitro fertilization, or [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=351.16s)]
*  IVF, after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos in a lab have the same [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  rights as children, the fallout sending shockwaves throughout the state and sending Republican [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=361.8s)]
*  politicians scrambling. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=367.32s)]
*  You see, IVF is extremely popular. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, extremely popular. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=372.2s)]
*  As Kellyanne Conway's own polling firm found, 86% of all voters support access to IVF, including [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  78% of self-identified pro-life advocates and 83% of evangelical Christians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's no wonder Nikki Haley is now desperately trying to backpedal after agreeing with the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=390.04s)]
*  Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos are babies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=394.56s)]
*  Today, she says IVF should still be available, because if there's one place Republican politicians [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=398.16s)]
*  do not want to be in an election year, it's on the losing side of a very popular issue. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=404.36s)]
*  Tara Setmayer worked as a GOP communications director on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=410.76s)]
*  She is now a senior advisor for the Lincoln Project. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=414.56s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=417.8s)]
*  Tara, it is so good to have you here tonight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=418.88s)]
*  I want to play for you a little bit of Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville on that ruling. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you have a reaction to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on the fact that embryos are [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=427.72s)]
*  children? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I was all for it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  We need to have more kids. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  We need to have an opportunity to do that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  I thought this was the right thing to do. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=439.24s)]
*  IVF is used to have more children, and right now IVF services are paused at some of the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=440.8s)]
*  clinics in Alabama. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  Aren't you concerned that this could impact people who are trying to have kids? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's for another conversation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=450.0s)]
*  I think that conversation is down, Tara. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=454.12s)]
*  How is this Alabama ruling and the threat to IVF roiling the Republican politics as [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  you see it right now? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=461.24s)]
*  Well, the idiocy of Senator Tuberville is palpable and just extraordinary at times. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not the only time he's sounded like an absolute moron, and he's paid for by the taxpayers [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  of Alabama. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  Listen, this is another example of a kryptonite issue for Republicans. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=475.76s)]
*  They know that the majority of the American people are pro-choice, and the overwhelming [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  majority of people are pro-IVF, including their own constituents in the Republican Party, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  including the evangelicals, who overwhelmingly support IVF. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=495.32s)]
*  There have been eight million babies born through IVF in this country. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=500.88s)]
*  So according to this Alabama Supreme Court ruling, I guess then all of those babies and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=506.72s)]
*  all of those families who have had the gift of life, thanks to this technology, should [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=512.44s)]
*  not have been born. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=516.76s)]
*  And all of those people who are looking forward to having children that suffer from infertility, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=518.52s)]
*  which is over six million women in this country, they just shouldn't have that opportunity. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=523.32s)]
*  Republicans do not want to have this discussion, because if I'm the Democrats, I'm coming out [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  and showcasing all of the families in my district or state or in a national election that have [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  had successful IVF pregnancies and say to them, I challenge Republicans to say that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  these children shouldn't have had an opportunity at life. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=552.92s)]
*  I mean, the extremism now is really beginning, I think, to sink in for some people, particularly [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=556.52s)]
*  women across this country who feel as though they are under attack. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  And they are. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=568.8s)]
*  The rights of women in this country are under attack daily, and the Republican Party is [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=569.8s)]
*  at the helm of it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=574.8s)]
*  Well, and you had yesterday Nikki Haley saying that she agreed with the Alabama Supreme Court [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=575.8s)]
*  that embryos are children, but later on, trying to clarify her remarks, announcing IVF should [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=581.36s)]
*  be available. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=587.5200000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts on, as an example of, to your point, this is a space Republicans [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=588.96s)]
*  just don't want to be in? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=594.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, Nikki Haley flip-flopping on an issue and having to backpedal and then explain again, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=597.0s)]
*  it's just another day that ends in why. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  This is part of the weakness of her candidacy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  And this is coming from someone who used artificial reproductive technology to have her own child. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=606.6s)]
*  So these people are just unbelievable at times. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=612.32s)]
*  And I'm glad that we're pointing this out. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=616.44s)]
*  She knows that this is not an issue they want to argue. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=619.16s)]
*  She knows that the idea of banning IVF is out of the mainstream, so she had to clarify. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=622.96s)]
*  She was trying to cater to Republican primary voters who are on the extreme, out of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=628.12s)]
*  mainstream on this, and then realize, oh, wait a minute, that's not the right answer. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=633.56s)]
*  So I need to keep myself honest in this and clarify. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=638.3599999999999s)]
*  Look, Republican strategists across the country know that the abortion issue, the women's [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=643.16s)]
*  rights issue, is a losing one for them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=647.88s)]
*  And there are over a dozen states that have abortion on the ballot this year for referendums. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=650.76s)]
*  And in those swing states where the abortion issue comes up, places like Michigan, Arizona, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, they do not want to have women coming out in large numbers, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=662.16s)]
*  particularly Republican women, pro-choice women, and voting as single-issue voters on [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=668.2s)]
*  this because that could swing the election for Democrats. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=673.4s)]
*  Republicans know this. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=676.68s)]
*  That's why Kellyanne Conway put that memo out, trying to tell them, hey, guys, you don't [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=677.68s)]
*  want this issue front and center. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=682.72s)]
*  You don't want to go here. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=683.72s)]
*  Word is a loser for us, and it should be. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=684.72s)]
*  Women's rights should not be under attack in 2024. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=687.72s)]
*  This is not an episode of the Handmaid's Tale. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=691.64s)]
*  But if you empower these people and let them get voted into office, it will be. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=694.28s)]
*  Darryl Sepp, Mayor, always bringing it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=698.24s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=702.04s)]
*  Thank you so much, Darryl. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=703.04s)]
*  If you want to know what Trump campaign staffers think about you, just watch Fox News like [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=704.96s)]
*  this weekend when they gushed over Donald Trump's new ploy for money, a limited edition [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=709.92s)]
*  series of gaudy gold $400 Trump sneakers. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=715.1s)]
*  And like they always do on Fox, somebody said the quiet part out loud on what the big [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=719.84s)]
*  sneaker strategy is really all about. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=724.48s)]
*  Even the sneaker thing. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=728.7800000000001s)]
*  I was on social media last night. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=729.7800000000001s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=732.1800000000001s)]
*  As you see, black support eroding from Joe Biden. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=733.1800000000001s)]
*  This is connecting with black America because they love sneakers. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=737.6s)]
*  They're into sneakers. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=740.72s)]
*  They love the, you know, this is a big deal, certainly in the inner city. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=741.72s)]
*  So when you have Trump roll out his sneaker line, they're like, wait a minute, this is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=745.32s)]
*  cool. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=749.2s)]
*  He's reaching them on a level that defies and is above politics. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=750.2s)]
*  The culture always trumps politics and Trump understands culture like no politician I've [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=754.12s)]
*  ever seen. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=759.4000000000001s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  Why didn't I think of this when I ran the RNC? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=767.6400000000001s)]
*  Black folks love sneakers and we can paint them gold. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=769.12s)]
*  This can't miss. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=774.2s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  It's a big miss and they ugly as hell. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=777.52s)]
*  Angela Carisone watches a lot of Fox as the president and CEO of Media Matters for America [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=781.76s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  $400 kicks? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=790.16s)]
*  Gold? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=792.16s)]
*  Are they really the cynical over there at Fox? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=794.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=796.64s)]
*  And you know, this same guy about a year ago when Trump's mugshot came out said that black [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=797.64s)]
*  people can quote relate to Donald Trump now and that it was actually going to increase [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=801.8s)]
*  support because he had quote street cred. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  This is the same guy. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=808.4000000000001s)]
*  So in some way this is not just a one off. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  This is part of a pattern from him and Fox News more broadly. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=813.12s)]
*  It just yeah, you know, the mugshot. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that works for us too. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=818.84s)]
*  We're used to seeing Fox do these types of things. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=822.0400000000001s)]
*  We're used to seeing them demonize minorities and sort of play up the sort of racial angle [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  on these things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  It gets worse each time though, seemingly. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=833.0s)]
*  Their audience really sucks this stuff in and just sort of takes it and goes, yeah, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=835.48s)]
*  this will work. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=841.4s)]
*  Black people now follow Donald Trump because they'll get a pair of sneakers? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=842.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because they tend to have it both ways. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=846.24s)]
*  Most of the time they're demonizing black people, right? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=848.6s)]
*  So just a few weeks ago they actually blamed the 737, the Boeing door that popped out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  They blamed that on Boeing allowing too many black people to work on airplanes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=856.82s)]
*  That was it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=860.76s)]
*  Not just one Fox News show. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=861.76s)]
*  That was an entire day of Fox News coverage. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=862.76s)]
*  That was an argument that they made and their audience completely consumed it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=865.18s)]
*  And that's a reflection of what they say to them every day. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=868.14s)]
*  But then they have these one offs where they actually get excited about the idea in this [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  false narrative that somehow Trump is capturing, you know, all sorts of people across the country [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=874.7399999999999s)]
*  that it's not just limited to his mug support base. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=881.26s)]
*  So here's some racist narratives Fox passed along just off the top of my head. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=883.9799999999999s)]
*  Bertherism, Obama phones, migrant caravans stealing jobs. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  They just had to apologize for live broadcast showing the guardian angels roughing up a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=893.82s)]
*  guy they said was a migrant who actually is from the Bronx. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=897.88s)]
*  What I miss? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=903.38s)]
*  Most recently it's claims that they are trying to secretly replace the national anthem. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=904.7800000000001s)]
*  That that's a big part of it that they've been sort of... [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=911.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh, because we sing at the national black anthem. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=913.46s)]
*  And is part of a larger conspiracy to dilute white power. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=915.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=918.94s)]
*  It is a huge problem. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=919.94s)]
*  And they're really worried about this because they've heard it played a lot more regularly [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=921.1s)]
*  and they think there's some conspiracy going on. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=924.66s)]
*  They tie them into the sort of the larger white genocide great replacement theory and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=927.32s)]
*  sort of the Fox News world. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=931.7s)]
*  They're actually the henchmen for the great powers, mostly Jewish people that are actually [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=933.44s)]
*  helping bring in all the immigrants. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=937.3000000000001s)]
*  They're helping perpetuate this through their sports and their culture. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=938.78s)]
*  So those are the two big ones more recently that you've missed at Fox. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  Somehow it just amazes me that people actually believe that, you know, seeing the national [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=944.94s)]
*  black anthem lift every voice and sing is threatening to white life here in America. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  I want to move on a little bit further into the abyss with the MyPillow guy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=958.98s)]
*  He of election denying fame, Mike Lindell, used ads that basically were all over the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=965.34s)]
*  network offering five million dollars to anyone who could go out there and disprove [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=974.14s)]
*  his election fraud claims. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=980.18s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=981.54s)]
*  He caught the car. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=982.54s)]
*  He did. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=983.54s)]
*  Someone actually disproved his claims. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=984.54s)]
*  And now he's doing the backstroke and trying to get a judge to get him off the hook. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=987.1s)]
*  What's wrong here? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=993.54s)]
*  And what does that say that he thought he could actually get away with the big lie like [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=994.54s)]
*  that? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1000.02s)]
*  I mean, part of it is that he got high on his own supply. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1001.02s)]
*  I mean, there was a he believed to a degree that he could sort of he could manifest this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1003.18s)]
*  through enough resources. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1008.54s)]
*  And why wouldn't he believe that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1009.54s)]

*  narratives into reality. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1025.78s)]
*  And Trump was a conduit for that. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1027.1399999999999s)]
*  So in this instance, he gets out there and says nobody can prove me wrong. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1028.3s)]
*  Five million dollars. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1031.3s)]

*  it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1035.9s)]
*  Let's take a little listen of Mr. Lindell. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1036.9s)]
*  And the media is all down at that end just attacking me from around the world. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1040.62s)]
*  But I'm welcoming it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1043.9s)]
*  I want to tell him, hey, we have to get rid of the electronic voting machines that go [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1044.9s)]
*  to paper ballots and count it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1048.74s)]
*  And I do want to say, Steve, my pillow, my pillow, thanks all of you. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1050.7s)]

*  It is. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1062.26s)]

*  It's a closed system. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1088.26s)]
*  And the rest of the right wing media is following suit. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLDYlA7BrOE&t=1089.54s)]
