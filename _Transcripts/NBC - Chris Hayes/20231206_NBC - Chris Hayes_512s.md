# ‘The threat is authoritarian government’: What happens if Trump wins again
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM)
*  Just days before the last presidential election, The Atlantic published a piece written by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=0.0s)]
*  Barton Gelman, who predicted with uncanny prescience that Donald Trump would attempt [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=5.36s)]
*  to subvert the results and overturn American democracy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=11.08s)]
*  Even laid out the plot pushed by Trump and his allies to convince Vice President Mike [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=15.34s)]
*  Pence that he had the unilateral power to announce his own reelection and a second term [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=19.76s)]
*  for Trump on January 6th. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=24.1s)]
*  Now at the time, Gelman's warning was not the consensus view. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=26.96s)]
*  But now, as we approach maybe a repeat of 2020, there's a growing agreement and acute [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=30.86s)]
*  concern I think across the political spectrum about the explicitly authoritarian threat [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=35.52s)]
*  of a second Trump term. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=41.34s)]
*  Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney believes that Trump will never leave office [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=43.16s)]
*  if he is elected president again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=46.86s)]
*  The New York Times just published this headline explaining, quote, why a second Trump presidency [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=49.08s)]
*  may be more radical than his first. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=52.44s)]
*  And the threat of another Trump term is the focus of a special issue of The Atlantic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=55.48s)]
*  devoted to the question of what happens, quote, if Trump wins. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=58.68s)]
*  In a new piece for that issue, Barton Gelman warns that if he makes it back to the White [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=62.8s)]
*  House, quote, we know what Trump would like to do with that power because he said so aloud, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=66.44s)]
*  he is driven by self-interest and revenge in that order. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  He wants to squelch the criminal charges now pending against him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=74.16s)]
*  He wants to redeploy federal prosecutors against his enemies, beginning with President Joe [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=76.8s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=80.24s)]
*  The important question is how much of that agenda he could actually carry out in a second [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=81.56s)]
*  term. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=85.24s)]
*  And Bart Gelman, staffer at Atlantic, joins me now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=86.24s)]
*  The sort of top line point that you make, which we talked about in the show, is that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=90.83999999999999s)]
*  you can't forget the fact that the man is literally running for his freedom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=95.08s)]
*  And I think it's so easy for it to seem abstract because the man has escaped accountability [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  for so long, he's 78 years old, but it's not like he could end up in prison. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=103.44s)]
*  That's not an insane idea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=110.52s)]
*  What prison would look like, the Secret Service, and what, you know. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  But that's a real thing that he's really scared about and is motivating, I think, more than [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=115.64s)]
*  anything to grab the run and the desire for power. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=122.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=124.84s)]
*  And I think there are people who console themselves with the idea that maybe he'll already be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=126.8s)]
*  convicted in one of the cases by the time the election comes around, and so they've [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=132.64s)]
*  got him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=137.92s)]
*  But that is not what's going to happen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=139.04s)]
*  Even if he does get convicted in the D.C. case, which is the only one that looks likely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=142.28s)]
*  to run its course before the election, the case will be on appeal when the time comes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=147.08s)]
*  that it's inauguration day. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=154.88s)]
*  If he wins, his Justice Department will move to withdraw the case on appeal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=156.32s)]
*  There's a legal maneuver called confession of error, and they go to the appeals court [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=164.6s)]
*  and say, never mind, we don't think he should have been convicted. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=170.92s)]
*  Withdrawn. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=174.2s)]
*  Withdrawn. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=175.2s)]
*  And I would be surprised if he doesn't also try to pardon himself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=177.6s)]
*  And the interesting thing about the pardon is there's a legitimate debate among constitutional [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=181.88s)]
*  scholars about whether a president can pardon himself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Like so many other things about Trump, it's sort of irrelevant, because if he does pardon [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=192.16s)]
*  himself, there is nobody withstanding to go to court and challenge that pardon except [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=197.4s)]
*  maybe the Justice Department, his own Justice Department. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=203.92s)]
*  Well, this speaks to a sort of thing I keep coming back to in this discussion, Sikhi, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=207.32s)]
*  as I was reading your piece, the Liz Cheney line about, you know, he's not going to leave, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=211.04s)]
*  is that, you know, it depends what other people do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=214.4s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't have unilateral power, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=217.56s)]
*  So when Liz Cheney says he's not going to leave if, you know, he's elected again, I [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=219.8s)]
*  thought, no, the Secret Service is going to escort him from the building at noon on January [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=223.24s)]
*  20th, 2029, because that's their constitutional duty. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=227.12s)]
*  And you could say, well, Chris, you're being naive. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=231.0s)]
*  But at some level, it's like, I guess I feel this battle within myself between warning [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  of the graveness of the danger and not ceding the terrain of his power. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=239.52s)]
*  Does that make sense to you? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=244.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=245.56s)]
*  I mean, and we shouldn't exaggerate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=246.56s)]
*  There are things the president can do and there are things the president can't do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=249.72s)]
*  And we don't know to what extent the guardrails will be holding. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=254.12s)]
*  There is a career civil service. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  He wants to politicize it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=261.56s)]
*  There are courts. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=263.6s)]
*  And he wants to steamroll them all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=264.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=268.56s)]
*  There's Senate confirmation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=269.56s)]
*  For example, it's not clear to me that even a Republican Senate would confirm Jeffrey [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=272.08s)]
*  Clark as attorney general. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=281.84s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=283.24s)]
*  Yes, not clear to me either. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=284.24s)]
*  They might not. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=285.24s)]
*  But what Trump's people are doing is very clever. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=287.64s)]
*  He can put in under the Vacancies Reform Act, he could put someone as attorney general for [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=292.52s)]
*  most of a year as an acting, as long as they're in any Senate confirmed position around the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=299.48s)]
*  U.S. government. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=306.6s)]
*  So, of course, if he comes into power in January 2025, the people already serving in confirmed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=307.6s)]
*  roles will be Biden appointees. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  But there's more than 100 positions that are Senate confirmed and that are held by Republicans [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  right now under Biden because there are all these like national labor relations. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=321.0s)]
*  Statutory bipartisan boards and positions. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=325.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=328.0s)]
*  Party balanced. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=329.52s)]
*  And the Trump people are looking at those names and trying to figure out what magas [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=330.96s)]
*  they've got to work with. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=335.32s)]
*  And then after 90 days, he could appoint anybody he likes, Mike Davis, Cash Fattel, as a counselor [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=336.92s)]
*  or a section chief in the Justice Department. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=347.16s)]
*  As long as they're a GS-15 or higher in DOJ, he can then make them acting attorney general. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=349.16s)]
*  And he could do that with all the other confirmed positions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=357.24s)]
*  And we've got to say they were very, very aggressive with the Vacancy Reform Act, which [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=359.72s)]
*  is the law that governs a lot of this stuff. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there's constitutional requirements for advising consent of the Senate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=365.72s)]
*  There's a huge sprawling government, the Vacancy Reform Act, which is a pretty loophole-ridden [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=369.24s)]
*  piece of legislation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  They were very aggressive on it before. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  But I guess my point, too, is everything you're describing, like in the end, what I see in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=376.0s)]
*  the future is a very immediate constitutional crisis if he's re-elected. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=380.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=385.16s)]
*  Four people roll over. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  It's one or the two. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  But I think the former is as likely as the latter, which is not like, oh, great, we're [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  just going to have a big constitutional crisis. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  It's just to say that he's going to go very hard and be very aggressive, and there are [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  going to be some obstacles in his way. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, the threat is authoritarian government. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  The threat is lawless government. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=402.16s)]
*  And people are going to have to stand up to that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  People are going to have to resist. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think a Trump presidency would for sure have more than one constitutional crisis. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=409.96s)]
*  You talk to legal experts, and they're all full of thoughts about loopholes he could [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=416.52s)]
*  exploit or residual powers or things that are profoundly against the norm, but that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=422.44s)]
*  a president could do if he wanted to go completely off the deep end. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=427.8s)]
*  But what they don't think about is stuff that's just flat out unlawful. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=433.88s)]
*  Unlawful. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=437.8s)]
*  I mean, by there's a legend that President Jackson once said that Justice Marshall has [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=438.8s)]
*  made his decision not to let him enforce it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=447.0s)]
*  Apparently, he didn't really say it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=450.12s)]
*  But he kind of meant that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=451.92s)]
*  And it's not clear to me who enforces a ruling about the Supreme Court if Trump says, I'm [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=454.12s)]
*  not doing that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=460.8s)]
*  I mean, Trump has said that any law or regulation or article of the Constitution can be terminated [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=462.68s)]
*  in the right circumstances, the right circumstances in that case being his fictions about the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=472.0s)]
*  election. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=478.44s)]
*  He said he could terminate it, and it's not clear who could stop him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=481.64s)]
*  Barton Gellman, that piece is in the special issue from The Atlantic. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=485.16s)]
*  It's sobering reading. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bqmdtQsuGM&t=488.88s)]
