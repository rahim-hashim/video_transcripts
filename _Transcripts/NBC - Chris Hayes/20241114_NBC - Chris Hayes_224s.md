# Aaron Rodgers moment perfectly sums up how fake information spreads
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM)
*  I offer a little parable for our agent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to use sports for a minute here, so indulge me. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  I promise I'm going somewhere with it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=4.12s)]
*  So this week on Sunday Night Football, Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff, generally a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=6.24s)]
*  very good quarterback, was having a terrible game against the Houston Texans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=10.28s)]
*  Goff threw four interceptions by halftime, meaning he threw the ball, the other team [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=14.68s)]
*  caught it, taking possession. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=18.0s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=19.0s)]
*  It's a turnover. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=20.0s)]
*  You don't want to do it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=21.0s)]
*  At halftime, someone posted a surprising statistic to social media, and it started going viral. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=22.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=26.48s)]
*  This is now Jared Goff's seventh career game with at least four interceptions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=27.48s)]
*  His record in those games? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=31.4s)]
*  Six and oh. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=32.96s)]
*  Now, for those of you who don't follow football, that is an extremely shocking, improbable, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=33.96s)]
*  indeed, it turns out, ridiculous claim. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=38.0s)]
*  Four interceptions a game is exceedingly rare. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=41.04s)]
*  Winning six games where you did it? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=43.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=44.84s)]
*  But it just kept circulating. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=45.84s)]
*  The original poster even shared what appeared to be a graphic from a well-known sports statistic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=46.84s)]
*  website to back it up that looks like stat news. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=51.2s)]
*  And that was apparently enough for folks to just parrot the claim on challenge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=54.24s)]
*  It went everywhere. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=57.6s)]
*  Even people who should know better, like ESPN host Pat McAfee and Aaron Rodgers, the conspiracy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=59.24s)]
*  theorist quarterback for the New York Jets, who RFK Jr. apparently wanted at one point [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=64.78s)]
*  as his running mate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  I love Jared. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he'll bounce back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  The amazing stat, though, is this a true stat that he's done four more picks seven times [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  and he's won every single one of those games? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=81.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=82.64s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=84.04s)]
*  I mean, that's why stats are for what big Mike used to say, age. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=85.04s)]
*  Stats for losers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=90.28s)]
*  Stats for losers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=91.28s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=92.28s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=94.28s)]
*  You can probably tell where I'm going with this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=95.28s)]
*  The statistic is not true. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=97.68s)]
*  It was a total lie. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=99.78s)]
*  Just take it from the guy who made it up in the first place, quoting, if you've ever wondered [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=101.94s)]
*  how easy it is to spread fake information, I made this stat up while laying in my bed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=107.28s)]
*  at halftime of the game. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  And this random Twitter football guy actually makes a pretty great point there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=115.6s)]
*  Now, thankfully, this is a totally harmless prank example of disinformation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=120.08s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=125.24s)]
*  The only consequence was McAfee getting embarrassed and having to walk it back on air. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=126.6s)]
*  But what happened in that exchange between Pat McAfee and do your own research, Aaron [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=130.66s)]
*  Rogers is kind of the entire story of our age, of our information environment right [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=135.68s)]
*  now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  These are the guys, those kinds of guys that are doing the vetting of what's true and not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=143.44s)]
*  in our current information environment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=148.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=151.6s)]
*  Those are the guardrails. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  They are doing their own research, if you will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=154.56s)]
*  And it's not just sports. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=157.52s)]
*  This problem translates across our political culture. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=158.52s)]
*  I mean, everything lies and misinformation and intentional slander about immigration [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=162.36s)]
*  and immigrants and the economy, they're spreading on this kind of terrain where the anti-vax [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  quarterback just parrots and unvetted statistic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  He saw an Elon Musk website to millions of people on the ESPN. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=175.36s)]
*  I saw this stat. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=178.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=179.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the whole problem in miniature. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  And the miniature version of the enormous problem that we all face that has gotten us [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=186.12s)]
*  to this point that the rest of us got to try to find some way to solve. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=190.44s)]
*  And I will be the first to say we do our part here, but I don't know the answer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=199.16s)]
*  But boy, oh, boy, are we going to have to come up with some. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGu3hhGcstM&t=200.16s)]
