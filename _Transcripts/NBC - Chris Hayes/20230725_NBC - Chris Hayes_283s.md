# Eastman lawyers draft memo to prosecutors to make case against indictment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0)
*  We are also getting new information about another potential communication between the special counsel and a key figure in the election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=0.0s)]
*  Investigation an attorney for John Eastman the lawyer who pushed that nonsensical theory [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=7.48s)]
*  You may remember that Mike Pence could overturn the election on January 6th [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=12.96s)]
*  He tells NBC News that he is working on a proactive hail Mary for his client [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=17.68s)]
*  Which is basically a memo to prosecutors explaining why Eastman? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=22.94s)]
*  Committed no crimes a lot to dig into on the legal front joining me now is Jonathan Dean's NBC News chief justice [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  Contributor so you've been behind a lot of this reporting and I understand you have new reporting about the thinking of John Eastman and other [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=34.0s)]
*  Defense lawyers, so what can you tell us about their expectations for a looming indictment? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=41.28s)]
*  Yeah, well first let's start with mr. Eastman [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  We spoke with one of his lawyers this afternoon [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=47.52s)]
*  And he says they're working on drafting a letter to prosecutors both in Washington and in Georgia [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Both the federal and Georgia and that they hope to have this memo drafted by next week to say to prosecutors [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  Look, he did nothing wrong. He was just a lawyer [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=62.48s)]
*  Floating theories floating ideas on how President Trump could win the argument and stay in office. There was nothing criminal here [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  We're not gonna cop to any plea and we hope to get this letter in front of prosecutors [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Before they make any charging decision regarding mr. Eastman now [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=78.28s)]
*  I knew it was described as a Hail Mary based on your reporting [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=82.2s)]
*  Why did they think it was necessary at this point in time and at this moment? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=85.44s)]
*  Well, there's some legal experts who would call it a Hail Mary the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=88.36s)]
*  Defense lawyers believe that he did nothing wrong. So they feel they want to head this off [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=91.72s)]
*  They obviously they've not received any target letter [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=95.88s)]
*  They've received no official communication that he is going to be charged [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=98.68s)]
*  But clearly based on all the reporting and all the action and activity that they clearly are concerned [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=102.88s)]
*  So they're trying to head off a possible indictment on that note his lawyer and other defense lawyers [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=108.0s)]
*  Representing others in this matter are of the view that at least as far as the special counsel is concerned [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=115.52s)]
*  Special counsel sent a target letter to Donald Trump, but so far to no one else [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=122.4s)]
*  So there is thinking and again, it's just thinking that speculation if you will by these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=126.8s)]
*  These defense lawyers that perhaps perhaps the special counsel move forward with an indictment against Trump and Trump only [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=132.48s)]
*  And that if there's a conspiracy charge in there, it'll just not name anyone else [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=139.52s)]
*  Why because there is a time frame, you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  They've got five years to charge anyone with a conspiracy or any of these obstruction charges [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=148.12s)]
*  But there's a timeline for the election that's coming along with some of the other trials regarding Donald Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  So perhaps the special counsel needs to move quickly on the Donald Trump front if and when he moves forward [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=158.64s)]
*  That's pretty I mean, let's just pause there for a moment because that's some pretty significant reporting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=164.92s)]
*  I know it's based it sounds like on the defense [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  The defense attorneys of other potential targets [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=172.44s)]
*  But what you're telling me now is that it seems like it might only be Trump based on their speculation that could be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=175.72s)]
*  It's just because this is not coming from inside the special counsel and only the special counsel knows [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  And so far we're getting no comment from them as to if and or when you know [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=187.48s)]
*  There's speculation that tomorrow's hunter Biden day [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=192.56s)]
*  So maybe tomorrow's not the day will Thursday be the day because that's in the next day the grand jury meets [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=194.82s)]
*  But at least as far as the talk among defense lawyers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=200.0s)]
*  So this is just thinking among lawyers who need to represent some of these actors and players [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=203.26s)]
*  There is some thought that perhaps the special counsel goes with Trump first and then at a later date [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=208.76s)]
*  Moves with some others and in terms of a later date based on your reporting and your sources is the expectation it could be post-election [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  Or what's the timeline there? I think there is no set timeline again if you're basing this just on statute of limitations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=222.4s)]
*  There's a five-year running mark from January 6. So you've got till what 2026 to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=229.56s)]
*  Make a determination. So he's got time. There's no time pressure there [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=236.24s)]
*  But again, we don't know the defense side all say they haven't received other target letters to these actors only Donald Trump has received one [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=240.04s)]
*  It is not customary for target letters to go out [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  But you would think in a case like this if others were going to be charged perhaps [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=251.2s)]
*  Perhaps the special counsel would be reaching out to some of the other parties to give them that heads up as his customer. Yeah [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=256.0s)]
*  You [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4bldaGwx0&t=269.92s)]
