# ‘Wuss’: George Conway on why Trump is ‘scared’ to debate Kamala Harris
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM)
*  George Conway, president and executive director of the Anti-Cycle Path Pack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=0.0s)]
*  George, thank you for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=5.44s)]
*  Look, you have, in short order, very much as we've seen the turnaround with the Harris [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=8.08s)]
*  campaign emerging, the Biden campaign receding, you have, in this same space of time, been [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  able to figure out a few triggers that you have, through your work, knowing Donald Trump, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=21.96s)]
*  as you know, how should we say, poking, making the poking sounds and noises around him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=28.6s)]
*  How do those types of efforts coalesce the general excitement around the general excitement [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=36.72s)]
*  that we see right now? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=43.0s)]
*  Because you have a lot of things happening, but they all seem to be happening in the same [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=44.2s)]
*  direction towards clarifying this race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=47.8s)]
*  Well, I think Congressman Clyburn put his finger right on it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=52.88s)]
*  He basically said people are exhausted or tired. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=56.16s)]
*  I don't remember the exact word he used, but they're tired and exhausted by Donald Trump's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  chaos, by his weirdness, by his bizarre behavior, and they want to talk about the future. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=62.6s)]
*  And that is the amazing contrast that we've just seen just flower in just less than two [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=68.24s)]
*  weeks with Kamala Harris. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=74.6s)]
*  She's the new and exciting and younger candidate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=77.4s)]
*  The Democrats have always been better at that, with John Kennedy and Clinton and Carter and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=80.2s)]
*  Obama. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=85.0s)]
*  And we've got this energy on one side, and then this other side, you just have insanity. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=86.0s)]
*  And people need it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  And what we've been trying to do is to remind, with the anti-psychopath pack, we're trying [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  to remind people of the craziness and the chaos because they've forgotten about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people have forgotten about it because Donald Trump was deplatformed after January [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=101.16s)]
*  6th. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=105.36s)]
*  He's been off the radar screens. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=106.36s)]
*  People haven't been watching his speeches in full bloom as they might now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=107.44s)]
*  And now they're saying, oh, gosh, I remember. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=113.2s)]
*  Oh, God, how can we go? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=115.92s)]
*  I can't do this anymore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=117.92s)]
*  Even the people, even Trumping people, have to be exhausted by this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=118.92s)]
*  Well, that's a good point because they are, believe it or not. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=122.96s)]
*  They don't like to speak about it too much publicly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  We know they're not good at that over the last six or seven years, sort of expressing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=129.44s)]
*  publicly what they tell us privately. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=133.0s)]
*  But there is a certain level of exhaustion with all of that on the GOP side. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Certainly the MAGA contingent is all in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=141.84s)]
*  But you're sort of leveling up the weird argument around Donald Trump, at the same time reminding [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=145.12s)]
*  voters, OK, this is what he said. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=151.52s)]
*  This is what he was like. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=154.8s)]
*  These are the things that he proposed, whether it was putting kids in cages or whatever. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=155.8s)]
*  Is it getting under his skin? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  It's getting under his skin. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  He issued a truth social post attacking me personally for taking out ads that he saw and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  did not like. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=170.16s)]
*  And he got angry at Fox News because we put a lot of those ads on Fox News. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=171.16s)]
*  Well, they ain't going to turn down the money. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=174.92s)]
*  Well, they ain't going to turn down the money. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=175.92s)]
*  Certainly local cable channels won't do it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=176.92s)]
*  Transactional. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=179.92s)]
*  And just to be on the safe side, in case he goes into the clubhouse, we did some on ESPN [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=180.92s)]
*  and the Golf Channel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=186.92s)]
*  So, you know, he's coming in from the front nine to splash water on his face and he can [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=187.92s)]
*  watch his craziness on television, courtesy of us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=194.16s)]
*  So that's what we're trying to do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=197.4s)]
*  We're doing that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=198.92s)]
*  We have four purposes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  One is to educate the public on his mental illness, his mental disorders, his psychological [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  disorders. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  Two is to explain why those make him dangerous. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  He's a clown and people laugh at him and that's part of the reason why they don't take it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=211.2s)]
*  seriously. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=215.2s)]
*  But he is an ill man and should not be anywhere near any lever of power. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=216.2s)]
*  Third is to get the press to talk about what they have consistently refused to talk about. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=222.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a book written by a former executive editor of the Washington Post. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=226.88s)]
*  They said, oh no, we're not going to talk about Trump's personality disorders. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=229.96s)]
*  And fourth is to trigger him into demonstrating those disorders. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=235.76s)]
*  And we've already done that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=239.4s)]
*  And, you know, after he had that disaster in front of the National Association of Black [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  Journalists, he went on a rally that night and he started talking about, oh, these people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=246.32s)]
*  want to say that I'm cognitively deteriorating. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=252.6s)]
*  And then he talked about, he talked about Handel and Lecter again, about Lecter being [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=255.2s)]
*  a psycho. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=259.12s)]
*  It's like, well, those are words we were using. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=260.12s)]
*  And, you know, he's got it in his head. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=262.24s)]
*  If you get in his head about a specific criticism, about something he's sensitive about, and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=264.48s)]
*  he knows he's a fraud. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=268.4s)]
*  He knows he's a pathological liar. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=270.12s)]
*  That's why he didn't want to get fact checked the other day in front of, in Chicago. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=272.12s)]
*  He knows he's not that smart. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=275.24s)]
*  That's why he always says he's a stable genius and pretends to be the smartest person in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=277.68s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=281.56s)]
*  He knows he's, you know, he knows he is not these things he has professed to be. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=282.92s)]
*  I mean, he... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=287.36s)]
*  So on that point, so on that point, you know, about, you know, sort of projecting this, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=288.36s)]
*  this air about him, he's, you had this interesting interview with Maria Bartiromo in which he, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=295.6s)]
*  she asked him about debating. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=303.2s)]
*  Let's take a quick listen to that because it feeds into what you're saying. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=304.32s)]
*  Are you going to debate her? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=307.44s)]
*  Well, I want to. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=312.16s)]
*  We're leading in the polls, it seems, by quite a bit still. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=313.44s)]
*  She's better than he is, but I think ultimately she'll be worse than him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=318.64s)]
*  She's more radical than him. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  He was a phony. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=323.76s)]
*  I got one word for that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=326.6s)]
*  Wuss. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  He is a wuss. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  He is scared of her. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  She will run circles around him, and he knows that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  He knows that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=334.76s)]
*  And all she's got to do, I mean, she's got the perfect happy warrior demeanor to do this, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=335.76s)]
*  is make fun of him to his face. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  She's talking about say it to my face. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=343.0s)]
*  Well, she will say it to his face. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=344.8s)]
*  And then when he says something insane, she will just roll her eyes and laugh and cackle, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=346.88s)]
*  and it will make him look incredibly weak. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=351.52s)]
*  She will destroy him. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=353.64s)]
*  George Conway. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNECjfZekRM&t=355.2s)]
