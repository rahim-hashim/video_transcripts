# GOP 2024 race Majority of Iowa caucusgoers say their minds aren’t made up
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM)
*  Anne Selzer is the president of Selzer & Company, a polling firm based in Des Moines, Iowa, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=0.0s)]
*  that she founded in 1996, and whose polling is considered the gold standard in the much [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=4.8s)]
*  important early nominating states. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=10.0s)]
*  I know from having done many Iowa caucuses myself. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=11.48s)]
*  And it is her firm that just conducted the first 2024 NBC News Des Moines Register poll. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=14.4s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=19.48s)]
*  So Anne, Steve just went through a lot of it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=21.16s)]
*  What stands out to you in this poll? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think that what's interesting about caucus polling is very difficult to do for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=27.12s)]
*  one thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=33.0s)]
*  And the reason it is, is because it's a fluctuating pool of people from cycle to cycle. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=34.0s)]
*  And I think it's easy to talk about, well, it's a set group of people and Donald Trump [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=40.4s)]
*  has this slice. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=46.92s)]
*  And maybe that's his ceiling, but maybe that's his floor. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=49.24s)]
*  And perhaps a way to think about it differently is you can make a bigger pie. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=52.48s)]
*  And one of the pieces of data in this poll shows that among independents, Trump's lead [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  is only two percentage points. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Now, there are only one out of four of the people who qualified as a likely Republican [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=65.48s)]
*  caucus goer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=70.32s)]
*  But what we have seen in the past is where the ground game of people talk about Iowa [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  and the importance of retail politics and the importance of the ground game. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=76.2s)]
*  But that's because you can go start knocking on doors and get people committed to your [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=80.1s)]
*  lesser ranked candidate and have them show up in sufficient numbers that they change [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=85.02s)]
*  the complexion of the caucus altogether. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  So one of those down ballot candidates might decide, look, if I can go and identify 40,000 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=93.1s)]
*  people who will agree to caucus for me, it can turn things upside down for Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=100.02s)]
*  That would be quite a story. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=105.94s)]
*  With that in mind, Anne, and you've been doing this for 27 years, what did you see in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  poll as kind of a sign of positive momentum for another candidate not named Donald Trump? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=112.78s)]
*  Well, I think that Steve Kornacki spoke to it, which is there's goodwill towards some [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  of these other candidates. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=125.58s)]
*  There's some ill will toward a couple of them, Mike Pence and Chris Christie, for example. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  But the will wasn't all that favorable to them when they ran for this in 2016. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=131.46s)]
*  So that sort of is their track record here in Iowa. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=136.9s)]
*  But I think that goodwill is a piece of it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=140.3s)]
*  And then I think it really has to do with how the candidates are going about recruiting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=143.06s)]
*  first time caucus goers, which aren't a terribly large portion, according to our poll just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=150.08s)]
*  yet. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  They were a bigger deal back in 2016. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=156.66000000000003s)]
*  I think that's there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=159.74s)]
*  I think the independent vote is there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=160.94000000000003s)]
*  I think identifying the people who are kind of done with Trump and figuring out how to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=162.94s)]
*  build, how to position yourself if you're the candidate in such a way that it is not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=170.14s)]
*  off putting, but in fact would bring more people out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=177.02s)]
*  Anne Selser, very hard to pull caucus goers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=182.5s)]
*  You are very, very good at it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=184.66s)]
*  The gold standard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=186.18s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me this evening. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNujzZdQQM&t=187.18s)]
