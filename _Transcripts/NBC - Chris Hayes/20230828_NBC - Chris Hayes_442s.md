# 'Like any defendant': Judge says Trump must ‘make the trial date work’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww)
*  So as of this morning, we now have a date for the start of what is possibly the highest stakes trial in history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald J. Trump's criminal trial for trying to steal the election. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=6.72s)]
*  It's going to start on March 4th, which is also the day before Super Tuesday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=10.72s)]
*  This means the Republican frontrunner will not be rallying supporters at MAGA rallies on the day before 15 states vote. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=15.6s)]
*  Instead, he will be sitting in a federal courtroom in D.C. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=21.68s)]
*  So for a guy who spent the majority of his life controlling the narrative and almost always getting away with things like, say, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=25.52s)]
*  joking about grabbing women or asking Russia to find Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=31.96s)]
*  Donald Trump has never faced criminal consequences or real accountability. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=38.24s)]
*  He doesn't even expect to. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, remember, he joked about how his supporters would still like him even if he shot someone in the middle of Manhattan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=44.72s)]
*  But that seems like it is changing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=50.0s)]
*  The ex-president wanted a trial date in 2026 and today he got one two years earlier in 2024. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=52.28s)]
*  Federal Judge Tonya Chukhin flatly rejected his attorney's plea in court this morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  Judge Chukhin repeatedly asked Attorney John Lora to come up with a compromise trial date. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  The Trump lawyer refused. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  So Judge Chukhin set one just two months after what the special counsel's office requested. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=70.36s)]
*  Trump seems to have lost control. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=75.36s)]
*  His entire life has been stagecrafted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=77.56s)]
*  But this time, he's not the one in charge of producing the show. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=79.64s)]
*  Joining once again are two veteran federal prosecutors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=83.0s)]
*  Thank you for sticking with me, Mary and Shans. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=85.48s)]
*  So I want to start just with how firm this March 4th date is as people are surking on their calendar. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=87.4s)]
*  Trump has said he wants to appeal that date. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=94.0s)]
*  He can't do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Could it still change? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=97.52s)]
*  It could still change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=99.64s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't just the trial date that Judge Chukhin set. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=100.8s)]
*  She set all kinds of interim dates, the dates for pretrial motions, the dates for the government to turn over its [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=103.92s)]
*  witness list, the gates for it to turn over its exhibits. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=109.16s)]
*  So there's a whole bunch of interim dates on the schedule. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=112.32s)]
*  There could be legitimate reasons, either on behalf of Mr. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=115.72s)]
*  Trump or the government, for one or two of those dates to slip by a day or two of factual or legal reasons that bring them into court to ask for it to slip. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=120.56s)]
*  There could be reasons for that date of March 4th to slip for a day or two or even a week or two. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=128.84s)]
*  But it's not going to slip to pass the election. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=133.64s)]
*  This is going to happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=136.24s)]
*  It's going to happen before the election. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=137.72s)]
*  I think it's going to happen before the convention. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=139.16s)]
*  But people shouldn't be alarmed if something happens and there's a day here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=142.08s)]
*  If it's March 7th or 8th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=146.96s)]
*  Yeah, right. Exactly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=148.44s)]
*  So, Shannon, one of the references is he can't actually appeal the date, but he can delay it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=149.8s)]
*  His lawyers can through pretrial motions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=155.88s)]
*  And Mary was referencing this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=157.84s)]
*  What do some of those look like? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Or what are some of the examples of what they could try to do? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, I think he will have some issues with genuine scheduling issues. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=162.08s)]
*  For example, they might have conflicting other appearance dates in the other cases. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=166.4s)]
*  He might actually be scheduled for a campaign appearance, which is not going to give him a magic bullet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=170.84s)]
*  Well, so let me just stop you there just for a second. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=175.88s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you. But if he has a campaign rally, is that a good enough reason to delay a trial? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=177.72s)]
*  Probably not. But it could delay things leading up to the trial. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=183.44s)]
*  And that's the key for him is to try and make some of those deadlines get delayed so that it might cause the actual trial date to move a bit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=187.32s)]
*  All else failing might be a good time for him to pull a muscle suddenly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=196.12s)]
*  So he can't get there that day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=199.44s)]
*  Pull a muscle or schedule a lot of rallies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=200.52s)]
*  So whenever the date starts, how long should we expect? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  You don't know the exact amount, but what's the scope of the amount of time that this kind of a trial could take? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=207.04s)]
*  I think the government has said four to six weeks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=211.56s)]
*  And that's because they've taken a look at what witnesses they expect to call, what exhibits they expect to introduce. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=214.44s)]
*  They've made an estimate about cross-examination time for each one of those witnesses. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=221.8s)]
*  But even that is an estimate based on the state of affairs now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=225.84s)]
*  There could be more people cooperating by then. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=229.52s)]
*  There could be some legal rulings that change what evidence is admissible and what is not. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=232.08s)]
*  So there's all kinds of things that could affect that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=237.72s)]
*  But I do think we're looking at at least probably a month long trial. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=240.12s)]
*  And if we count also jury selection is going to take time, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=243.44s)]
*  They're going to have to have questionnaires to make sure people can be fair and unbiased and haven't don't have pre has haven't prejudged the case. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=247.4s)]
*  That can take a while in a case like that could make it take a little bit longer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=254.12s)]
*  Right. So they will already have done those jury questionnaires before March 4th and they're hoping to actually swear the jury on March 4th. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  But if they have a hard time getting enough people, you know, that could that could push off a little bit. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  I would disagree with Shan, though, that the judge is going to give him a pass for things like campaign rallies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=271.68s)]
*  I think she was pretty clear. It seems like it's a bit of a give. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=277.8s)]
*  Yeah. I think she was pretty clear today. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=280.56s)]
*  People have jobs. And when you're a criminal defendant, you know, that's part of your job. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=282.56s)]
*  But he might miss the plane. He might miss it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=287.08s)]
*  Don't give him ideas. OK. So also, he has his own plane. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  He does. You can't really miss it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=293.72s)]
*  Judge Chuckin says she's, quote, watching carefully for anything that might affect or poison the jury. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=295.44s)]
*  Well, this really stuck out to me today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=301.36s)]
*  She says that if Laura intends to pull D.C. residents as part of a change of venue motion, he must inform the court. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=303.0s)]
*  What does that mean? And kind of what might she do? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=309.08s)]
*  What does she mean by that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really the big looming question here is how do you interpret all the stuff he says as trying to poison the jury pool? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=313.12s)]
*  And there's a very in a normal case, all of it would be tainting the jury pool. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=322.84s)]
*  And here she's trying to fairly balance the idea of you got to let him campaign. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=327.32s)]
*  He has a right to say, you know, I'm innocent, et cetera. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=331.36s)]
*  That's if he keeps going really over the line with that, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=334.68s)]
*  D.O.J. will be forced to bring that to the judge's attention. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=339.12s)]
*  The judge will have to rule on it. I don't think she'll be shy about ruling on that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=342.56s)]
*  I'm sure she'll give him a couple of passes with stern warnings. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  But I don't think that D.O.J. is very chomping at the bit to want to bring that because they're so worried about being hit on the First Amendment concerns. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  They're also worried it'll look like it's political persecution, which is what he's running on right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  So there, Judge Chuckin, I mean, many people described her as not messing around. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=362.8s)]
*  There's lots of ways to describe her. But watching the ruling this morning and how she's behaved to date, what is your take? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=366.92s)]
*  What do you read from it and how she's going to operate this trial? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=373.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, she is committed to treating him like any other criminal defendant. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=375.44s)]
*  Now, he's already not being treated exactly like any other criminal defendant, but she wants to do so as much as possible. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=379.44s)]
*  And I think what she did today, like Judge Chuckin was a criminal defense attorney. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=385.44s)]
*  She has defended cases and prepared for trial herself many, many times in her careers, never defending somebody like Mr. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=391.32s)]
*  Trump, but, you know, defending complicated criminal cases. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=398.64s)]
*  So she's able to really assess how long will it take in a case like this to get ready? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=402.08s)]
*  And I think she's bringing all of her experience both as a criminal defense attorney and as a judge to bring here and try to give him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, not try. She will give him a fair trial, try to respect his rights to due process, but not let him run the show. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcVzaFw7ww&t=414.52s)]
