Video Description: Chris Hayes: “There were no disputes. The court was not actually solving any problem between two parties. Instead, the conservative majority was functioning like a legislative body, pushing their preferred right-wing policy outcomes irrespective of the actual facts at hand.”

# 'Galling' Hayes on the 'imperial mindset' of the Supreme Court conservatives
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8)
*  Today, in a pair of 6-3 rulings, the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority struck [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=0.0s)]
*  down President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, and they ruled in favor of a Colorado [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=5.72s)]
*  web designer who wants the legal right to refuse service to gay patrons. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=10.88s)]
*  Now, I'm not a lawyer, but even a layman can tell that both these rulings were legally [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=15.36s)]
*  dubious in a way I'll explain in a moment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  There's something fundamentally broken here that's on display I think is worth taking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=23.8s)]
*  some time to get into. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  The archetypal example of judging, right, the one that we all think of when we think [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  of judging, goes back to biblical history, all the way back to the judgment of Solomon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  He's a king, but also a judge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=40.62s)]
*  That's part of what kings did back then, and the king, as judge, is tasked with solving [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=42.1s)]
*  a dispute between two women, each of whom claims custody over a child. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=46.18s)]
*  It's the one where Solomon suggests cutting the baby in half. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Now by saying that, he reveals who the real mother is, but more importantly, in revealing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=56.06s)]
*  who the real mother is, finding a fact, he resolves the dispute. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  Oh, you're the real mother, you get the child. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=64.78s)]
*  That resolving disputes is fundamentally what judges do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=68.26s)]
*  They resolve conflict nonviolently when it arises. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  That's what we have them for. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=76.86s)]
*  Two sides claim to be harmed, and a judge tries to find a resolution. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=78.7s)]
*  And this is true when it comes to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=83.42s)]
*  The highest court in our country only deals with the tangible, not the hypothetical. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=86.94s)]
*  Its own website says so. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=91.66s)]
*  I quote from it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=93.1s)]
*  The court does not give advisory opinions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=94.1s)]
*  Rather, its function is limited only to deciding specific cases. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=97.14s)]
*  In order to get before the Supreme Court, and it is very difficult, the vast majority [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=103.14s)]
*  of cases don't get there, you need to have some sort of dispute between parties with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=106.26s)]
*  an actual injury that needs to be resolved. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=110.34s)]
*  Take for example, Brown versus the Board of Education. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=113.94s)]
*  Iconic case. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=117.62s)]
*  Oliver Brown wanted to send his black daughter to the school that was closest to their home. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=118.62s)]
*  The Topeka, Kansas Board of Education insisted that she be bussed to a segregated school [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=122.78s)]
*  farther away. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=127.78s)]
*  That was the dispute. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=129.4s)]
*  The injury was the injury to the family and the daughter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=130.46s)]
*  What makes today's two cases so galling is that there were no disputes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=134.92s)]
*  The court was not actually solving any problem between two parties. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Instead, the conservative majority was functioning like a legislative body, pushing their preferred [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=146.92s)]
*  right-wing policy outcomes, irrespective of the actual facts at hand. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=152.56s)]
*  So let's start with the first one. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  The first is the case of 303 Creative. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  Lori Smith owns a company called 303 Creative in Littleton. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=163.76s)]
*  She wants to make wedding websites, but not for same-sex couples. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=168.0s)]
*  She and her attorneys claim that Colorado's anti-discrimination law violates her free [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=172.68s)]
*  speech rights. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=177.2s)]
*  Now her case has gone to the US Supreme Court. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=178.76s)]
*  She hasn't actually developed a website and refused to serve LGBT people, but she said [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=181.5s)]
*  if she does weddings, which is where she's going to, she doesn't want to have to do that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=188.56s)]
*  for same-sex couples. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=193.4s)]
*  Okay, this case is frankly ridiculous. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=195.6s)]
*  A woman who might want to start making wedding websites one day, but doesn't and wasn't [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=199.04s)]
*  when she filed the suit, wants the right to refuse service to a hypothetical gay couple [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=205.12s)]
*  that wants her to design their website on religious grounds should they ever ask her [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=211.4s)]
*  to make them one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=215.8s)]
*  No one has asked her to make one. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=217.76s)]
*  It's almost as if this case was designed for the express purpose of moving this issue [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=220.44s)]
*  up through the courts so the Supreme Court could rule on it, almost like what would [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  be the word, advisory opinion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=228.12s)]
*  Now to be fair, Lori Smith did eventually cite one example of a potential client, a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=230.68s)]
*  guy named Stuart requesting a wedding website for him and someone named Mike. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=234.92s)]
*  Her lawyers say that request came one day after she filed her initial lawsuit back in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=239.6s)]
*  2016. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=243.84s)]
*  Though, interesting wrinkle here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=244.84s)]
*  A reporter with the New Republic called up Stuart and well, he's married to a woman. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=246.88s)]
*  Quote, I wouldn't want anybody to make me a wedding website. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=251.76s)]
*  I'm married. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=254.76s)]
*  I have a child. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=255.76s)]
*  I'm not really sure where that came from, but somebody's using false information in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=256.76s)]
*  a Supreme Court filing document. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=259.84s)]
*  Now I guess it's certainly possible Smith did receive such requests seven years ago. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=262.48s)]
*  There's some mix up of the names. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=265.56s)]
*  But that still doesn't explain how she has been harmed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=267.56s)]
*  What is the harm? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=271.28s)]
*  What harm has she suffered? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=272.32s)]
*  According to her own petition to the court, she just, quote, plans to expand her business [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  to design wedding websites in the future. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=279.2s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  I plan to dunk someday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=284.52s)]
*  And yet today, the Supreme Court ruled in Lori Smith's favor on this conjured hypothetical [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  set of facts with no actual dispute. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  Because the conservative majority doesn't care about the actual facts and they don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  care about actually judging. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=298.56s)]
*  They want to undermine Colorado's anti-discrimination law, making it easier for religious conservatives [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=301.0s)]
*  to discriminate against gay people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=306.12s)]
*  That's the policy outcome they wanted from the beginning. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=308.52s)]
*  It's why the case got to them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=311.16s)]
*  That's one of today's rulings. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=312.96s)]
*  But then there's another one. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=314.6s)]
*  There's also the student loan case where, once again, wait for it, no one has been injured. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=315.6s)]
*  President Biden want to relieve up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for some borrowers, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=322.68s)]
*  $20,000 for others. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=326.88s)]
*  Now the holder of the debt is the federal government. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=328.56s)]
*  The people whose debts are canceled, well, they're not injured. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=331.9s)]
*  They're beneficiaries, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=334.32s)]
*  So who's injured here? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=335.96s)]
*  Well, you can argue that the taxpayer, us as U.S. taxpayers, we're injured. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=337.4s)]
*  We're on the hook for it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=342.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=343.32s)]
*  You cannot just sue the government because you're a taxpayer who doesn't like how it's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=344.32s)]
*  spending its money. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=347.8s)]
*  It's a bedrock principle of standing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=348.8s)]
*  Because otherwise, literally every single cent the government spends would spawn an avalanche [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=350.96s)]
*  of lawsuits. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=355.08s)]
*  Totally unworkable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=356.08s)]
*  Black letter law, you can't do it, okay? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=357.52s)]
*  A couple of individuals came up with this tortured and somewhat preposterous reason [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=359.84s)]
*  why they were injured, and that was one of the suits today. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  And unanimously, it was kicked on standing grounds. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=367.2s)]
*  These people don't have standing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't have an injury. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  But there was another case. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=373.0s)]
*  And opponents of debt relief landed on this agency called Mohella, and it handles student [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=374.64s)]
*  loans in Missouri. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  Now here's the crazy thing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=382.84s)]
*  There's the logo, Mohella. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=384.08s)]
*  The people that were punitively injured by this did not want any part of this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=386.64s)]
*  As the American Prospect reports, quote, internal documents from the company reinforce it did [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=392.56s)]
*  not file, did not solicit, indeed had nothing to do with the case at all. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=397.28s)]
*  In fact, one analysis found that Mohella would stand to make more money if the debt relief [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=402.84s)]
*  plan goes through, otherwise known as the opposite of an injury. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=408.96s)]
*  And don't just listen to me on this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=412.8s)]
*  Here's oral arguments. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=415.08s)]
*  Justice Amy Coney Barrett actually asked the solicitor from Missouri, arguing to end the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=416.4s)]
*  debt relief. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=421.28s)]
*  What's up with Mohella? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=423.28s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=424.28s)]
*  Why aren't they here? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=425.28s)]
*  Do you want to address why Mohella's not here? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=426.28s)]
*  Mohella's not here because the state's asserting its interests. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  Mohella doesn't need to be here because the state has the authority to speak for them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=433.24s)]
*  And that brings me to- [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=436.9s)]
*  Why didn't the state just make Mohella come then? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=437.9s)]
*  If Mohella's an arm of the state, why didn't you just strong arm Mohella and say you've [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=440.0s)]
*  got to pursue this suit? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=443.24s)]
*  Your Honor, that's a question of state politics. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=447.92s)]
*  That's a question of state politics? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  They're not here because why? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  Because they're not injured. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=455.18s)]
*  Because there is no injury because there's no actual dispute. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=456.18s)]
*  You just, state of Missouri, run by Republicans, don't like the policy and want to use the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=459.36s)]
*  Trump supermajority Supreme Court to get rid of it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=465.48s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  Justice Barrett, who asked that question, good question, ruled in that guy's favor anyway. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  The conservatives on the Supreme Court do not like Biden's student loan and forgiveness policy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=475.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter if there was no injury, no one withstanding, and there's no real dispute. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=482.2s)]
*  When you have judges that turn away from the work of resolving disputes and following precedent, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=489.2s)]
*  they're just not doing anything that's recognizably judging anymore. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=497.2s)]
*  Dividends are what binds a judge and judging. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=503.2s)]
*  And the problem is not just that I think the substance of these decisions both are bad, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=506.2s)]
*  although I very much do. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=511.2s)]
*  It's that this court has adopted a kind of imperial mindset that all decisions about [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=513.2s)]
*  public policy are actually theirs to make. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=519.2s)]
*  Six right-wing politicians in robes on the Trump Supreme Court are granting themselves [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=523.2s)]
*  the authority to govern as a kind of unaccountable super legislature. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=527.2s)]
*  At this point, you're well within your rights to start asking, well, who elected these people? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=532.2s)]
*  If they're not bound by precedent, if they're not bound by disputes and standing and all the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=536.2s)]
*  trappings of judging, and they just say, like, I don't like this law, I don't like that policy, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=540.2s)]
*  who elected them? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=544.2s)]
*  What's more, you would be forgiven for thinking the whole thing is corrupt and illegitimate [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=546.2s)]
*  and wondering how long exactly this can continue without some seismic reform. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjXywzIpFE8&t=551.2s)]
