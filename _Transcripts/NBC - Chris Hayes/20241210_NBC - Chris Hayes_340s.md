# ‘This is a signal flare’: Swalwell reacts to Trump DOJ secretly seizing his phone records
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo)
*  Congressman Eric Swalwell is a Democrat of California whose records were reportedly collected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=0.0s)]
*  by the Trump DOJ. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=4.96s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=6.7s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=7.7s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the program. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=9.18s)]
*  You have known for some time that the DOJ had done this to you, but we are learning [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=11.48s)]
*  more details today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=16.82s)]
*  As my colleague was just pointing out, what is your reaction to all of this and what we've [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=18.36s)]
*  learned? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=22.44s)]
*  This is a signal flare, the flashing of the dashboard right now that we are in for some [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=24.32s)]
*  concerning times because Trump and his DOJ went after their critics when there were serious [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=31.76s)]
*  lawyers at the DOJ. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=38.38s)]
*  And now you have very unserious people in Pambondi and Cache-Fatale who are coming in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=40.6s)]
*  and promising to clear out all of those individuals. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=46.56s)]
*  Now, I will also say if Donald Trump wanted to look at pictures of my kids and 49ers memes, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=50.68s)]
*  he could have just followed me on Instagram. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=57.2s)]
*  But he did this, I believe, calling me out and calling Schiff out and saying to go after [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=59.88s)]
*  leakers to send a signal to his Justice Department prosecutors to look at us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=64.94s)]
*  They found nothing, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned in a new guardrail-less [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=70.4s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=77.26s)]
*  Our country has a little bit of history with this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=80.04s)]
*  There is precedent for this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=81.84s)]
*  Of course, FBI under its first director, J. Edgar Hoover, he loved to spy on his perceived [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=82.84s)]
*  domestic enemies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=87.92s)]
*  In 1971, the House Democratic leader, Hale Boggs, called for Hoover to resign amid reports [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=89.56s)]
*  that he was wiretapping members of Congress. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=97.06s)]
*  I believe the fear of phone tapping is as dangerous as a fact. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  For it can only chill the kind of free discourse we must have if we are to continue as a free [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  society. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=109.64s)]
*  Nowhere, nowhere is free speech more vital than in the halls of Congress. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=110.64s)]
*  It is the very essence of this organization, which is the people's forum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=118.28s)]
*  Of course, President Nixon actually took Hoover's side, as we all remember. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=124.68s)]
*  He stayed on at the FBI until his death the next year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=128.84s)]
*  Congressman, when you look back at that, when you hear that, if history does repeat itself, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=132.6s)]
*  which we hope it does not, but what are members of Congress prepared to do about it? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=136.4s)]
*  We're going to be the fence that protects the country from this new wrecking ball administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=142.0s)]
*  Essentially, the House will fence him in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=150.72s)]
*  We have a very strong minority, a united minority on the House Democratic side. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=153.88s)]
*  We're only essentially two seats down, and we know where to go to find Republican allies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=159.8s)]
*  I just want to say this, Eamon, and I'll say this to the president-elect. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=165.92s)]
*  If you want a partner on immigration, security at the border, and addressing the workforce [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  crisis, look at me and many of my colleagues. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=174.56s)]
*  If you want a partner on reducing violent crime and going after sexual predators, look [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  at me and my Democratic colleagues. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  If you want a partner on making sure that hard work adds up to doing better and dreaming [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  bigger, look at me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=188.2s)]
*  If you're going to punish your enemies and only benefit the broliarchy, the Elon Musk's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  and the billionaire boys that you're hanging out with, we will fence you in, and I will [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=194.68s)]
*  be one of the tallest posts of that fence. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=198.52s)]
*  It's really about what kind of presidency does Donald Trump want to have, and what kind [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  of leader does he want to be for the country? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=207.24s)]
*  So much of this comes down to, as we heard from Ken and others previously, that it depends [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  on who actually runs the law enforcement agencies, if you will, under Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  I've got to say, it's not giving us a lot of confidence right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=217.72s)]
*  He's picked a MAGA loyalist in Kash Patel to run the FBI. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  Kash Patel previously served on Trump's National Security Council, and his old boss in that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=224.24s)]
*  job, former national security adviser John Bolton, writes in The Wall Street Journal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=229.12s)]
*  today that Kash Patel does not belong at the FBI. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=233.44s)]
*  Quote, too many of Mr. Trump's personnel selections evidence his assiduous search for [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=237.44s)]
*  personal fealty, not loyalty to the Constitution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=243.34s)]
*  Kash Patel's nomination as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation squarely fits [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=247.52s)]
*  this pattern. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=251.8s)]
*  Your thoughts on Kash Patel and what you have learned so far about him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=253.44s)]
*  Well, I worked across from Kash Patel on the House Intel Committee, and he was a loyalist [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=256.96s)]
*  to Devin Nunes and did everything to be a wrecking ball there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=263.52s)]
*  And he blindly followed the orders of Nunes and essentially Trump, and he'll do the same [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=268.8s)]
*  at the FBI. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=273.76s)]
*  But to the agents at the FBI and the DOJ prosecutors, I say this, I was a prosecutor once. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=274.76s)]
*  I had an oath to upkeep to the Constitution and to the court. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=281.56s)]
*  And you're not helpless. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=285.8s)]
*  You do not have to follow illegal orders. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=287.04s)]
*  And the American people, while they want to see the costs of their goods and groceries [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=290.64s)]
*  come down, they do not want us to look like Russia or China. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=295.14s)]
*  And so it's going to depend on the men and women at the FBI and the DOJ to stand tall [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=299.56s)]
*  and to show the courage that really led them to join the ranks of those forces. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=305.04s)]
*  And I still have trust that they will be a firewall as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=310.92s)]
*  All right, Congressman Eric Swalwell from California. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you again. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=317.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=318.76s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8miDU59TtZo&t=319.76s)]
