# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM)
*  As the voting is underway to determine the Republican nominee for president in 2024, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be on trial. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=6.24s)]
*  Just today, we learned that the ex-president must appear in court on May 20, 2024, in Fort [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=9.4s)]
*  Pierce, Florida, for the start of his first federal criminal trial in the classified documents [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=14.68s)]
*  case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=21.44s)]
*  Donald Trump will be tried on 37 counts, with charges ranging from conspiracy to obstruct [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=22.44s)]
*  justice to willful retention of government documents and making false statements. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=27.2s)]
*  That ruling came today from the Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=33.28s)]
*  It was the first test that she has faced as to whether or not she would be impartial to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=36.28s)]
*  the ex-president. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=42.32s)]
*  There were valid concerns that she would be lenient with him, given a past ruling related [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=43.96s)]
*  to this very case. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=48.34s)]
*  While the special counsel's team wanted a speedy trial starting December, Trump wanted [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=49.84s)]
*  to postpone the entire trial until after the election, postpone it indefinitely. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=54.24s)]
*  Imagine his willingness to be tried if he were to become president of the United States [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  again. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=63.36s)]
*  Because Trump argued there was no way he could receive a fair trial while running for president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=64.36s)]
*  That argument was just part of the ex-president's broader scheme to avoid facing justice or, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=69.68s)]
*  potentially, jail time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=74.64s)]
*  Today, Judge Cannon split the difference. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=77.12s)]
*  She said the amount of evidence and discovery in the case warranted a trial date several [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=79.6s)]
*  months down the line from December. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=83.96s)]
*  So the ex-president will be forced to sit before a federal jury and a jury of his peers [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  as they consider whether or not he is guilty of a sprawling 37-count indictment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=91.46s)]
*  This news is not great for the Republican frontrunner because that date, May 20th, 2024, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  is right smack in the middle of the primary season. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to take you down a little walk here with the calendar. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=106.08s)]
*  January 15th kicks off the primary season. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  Those are the Iowa caucuses. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=112.56s)]
*  March 5th is Super Tuesday. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=115.16s)]
*  Whole bunch of states vote on March 5th. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=116.84s)]
*  But come March, the ex-president has more to worry about than just primaries because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=118.72s)]
*  20 days later, he's due in Manhattan, March 25th, to face trial in what prosecutors say [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=122.72s)]
*  was an illegal hush money scheme that he orchestrated during the 2016 campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  And since this March 25th trial is a criminal trial, he has to physically be in court rather [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=135.62s)]
*  than campaigning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=142.48s)]
*  He'll be forced to sit down and listen to how prosecutors lay out the evidence against [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Eight days after that, come April, there are a slew of primaries in Delaware, New York, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  And less than a week before his federal trial is set to start in Florida, and he's going [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  to have to be looking through papers and documents, there are contests in Maryland and Nebraska [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=160.12s)]
*  and West Virginia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  That's May 14th. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=167.04s)]
*  Then May 20th, Trump takes a break from the campaign trail for roughly two weeks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=168.04s)]
*  Not by choice, but by the order of law. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=171.88s)]
*  He will have to listen to federal prosecutors make their case to the jury. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=175.12s)]
*  And the start of the trial is just one day before Kentucky and Oregon hold their primaries. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=179.12s)]
*  And even if that trial date sticks, right at the end of it, there will be more primaries [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=183.96s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., in Montana, in New Jersey, in New Mexico, and in South Dakota. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=188.66s)]
*  July 15th will be the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, at which point there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=194.0s)]
*  is a possibility that Donald Trump will be a twice convicted felon. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=198.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=203.52s)]
*  Now, take a look at this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=204.52s)]
*  This is a broader look at what Trump's legal woes look like. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=206.4s)]
*  He's going to face a handful of civil lawsuits this fall and early next year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  While those civil suits are sure to cause a headache for him, the ex-president is not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  required to be in court for those trials. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=217.12s)]
*  They're not criminal trials. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't have to be there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  The implication of Trump's May 2024 trial date are interesting. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  Last time we had broad primaries, Joe Biden clinched the Democratic nomination on April [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=226.84s)]
*  the 8th when Bernie Sanders dropped out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=231.6s)]
*  In 2016, Donald Trump became the Republican nominee on May 3rd when Ted Cruz dropped out. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=233.96s)]
*  Barack Obama, 2008, he officially got his name on the ticket on June 3rd. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  In the year 2000, George W. Bush secured the Republican nomination on March the 9th when [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=244.3s)]
*  John McCain dropped out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=250.06s)]
*  Bill Clinton became the Democratic nominee in 1992 when he secured the number of delegates [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=252.16s)]
*  he needed on June the 2nd. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=256.3s)]
*  So there's a good chance Donald Trump might be trying to secure the Republican nomination [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  as he sits for his federal trial. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=262.94s)]
*  And then there's the possibility that Trump could face two more indictments. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=264.6s)]
*  There's Jack Smith's 2020 election probe where we learn this week that Trump is officially [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=270.22s)]
*  a target of that criminal investigation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=274.1s)]
*  He was officially warned this week that he could face an indictment in that case for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=276.3s)]
*  his efforts to subvert democracy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=281.16s)]
*  And we've got brand new developments out of Georgia conducted by Fulton County District [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=284.64s)]
*  Attorney Fonny Willis that we're going to get to next in this show. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=288.6s)]
*  But in the midst of all this chaos, the ex-president has warned us what he's going to do over and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=292.52s)]
*  over again if he wins again. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=297.72s)]
*  Just this weekend, Trump went out of his way to sing the praises of Judge Aileen Cannon [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=299.2s)]
*  as he waited to see if she would rule in his favor and delay the trial. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=303.24s)]
*  Do you have any indication the judge will grant this motion? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=311.08s)]
*  It's a very highly respected judge, a very smart judge and a very strong judge. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=312.24s)]
*  But you appointed her. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=315.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=316.8s)]
*  And I'm very proud to have appointed her. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=317.8s)]
*  But she's very smart and very strong and loves our country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=319.28s)]
*  I mean, loves our country. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=324.4s)]
*  We need judges that love our country so they do the right thing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=326.28s)]
*  So they do the right thing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  That pressure, that strategy apparently did not work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=333.88s)]
*  But the ex-president is warning everybody literally about everything. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=336.56s)]
*  Just yesterday, he posted an ominous video with the caption, quote, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=340.24s)]
*  We aren't afraid of them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  If you f*** around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=346.8s)]
*  that have never been done before. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is running for the presidency of the United States as the evil villain. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=354.24s)]
*  And he's telling us exactly what he will do if things don't go his way. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=359.72s)]
*  This is the final battle. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=364.6s)]
*  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=366.6s)]
*  We will expel the warmongers from our government. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=369.6s)]
*  We will drive out the globalists. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  We will cast out the communists, Marxists and fascists. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  We will route the fake news media. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  And we will liberate America from these villains once and for all. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  This is some weird stuff. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=391.72s)]
*  So as we wait to see if Trump will get a second indictment from Jack Smith over Trump's scheme [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=393.68s)]
*  to subvert democracy, the question is, will he ever be held to account? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=397.68s)]
*  The only real way to stop this guy, who is actually running as the evil villain, from [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  becoming the actual evil villain, seems to be prosecution. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=407.36s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jonah Goose of Colorado served as a House impeachment manager for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=414.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's second impeachment over his incitement of the January 6th insurrection. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=418.12s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you in person. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  Good to see you, Ali. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=424.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=425.52s)]
*  There are very few people in this country who have been through this process, albeit [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  it was earlier. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=429.12s)]
*  You had less information. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=430.12s)]
*  You had to move very fast because that impeachment took place very soon after the insurrection. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=431.12s)]
*  What's your sense of what's going on with Jack Smith, the target letter, the things [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  that we hear Donald Trump may be charged with? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  Are you satisfied that those are the right things, first of all? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=443.96s)]
*  Well, I would say first, clearly, a series of significant developments, in particular [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  the reporting regarding the target letter, Mr. Trump's disclosure of that letter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=452.6s)]
*  Of course, we don't necessarily know what statutes were invoked in the letter, and it [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  isn't necessarily the case that to the extent the special counsel or the grand jury are [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  pursuing various criminal charges against the former president, that they would be limited [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  to those statutes or involve those statutes at all. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's pretty premature for me to opine necessarily on the nature of the indictment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  What I will say is there is no dispute, as you know, thinking back and reflecting on [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=474.44s)]
*  the impeachment trial a year and a half ago, that the president, as Mitch McConnell readily [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=480.28s)]
*  conceded, was morally and practically responsible for ultimately provoking the events of that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  fateful day on January 6th. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  And we believed he was ultimately guilty of constitutional crimes, ultimately the constitutional [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=492.4s)]
*  crime for which he was impeached. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=499.0s)]
*  A trial was held in the Senate, the most bipartisan vote for conviction in the history of presidential [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  elections, notwithstanding that it didn't meet the constitutional two-thirds standard [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=506.36s)]
*  for a vote. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=510.88s)]
*  So look, at the end of the day, as Mitch McConnell again, at the risk of quoting him too often, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=511.88s)]
*  but he has said this previously, that no former president is immune to civil liability or [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=516.48s)]
*  criminal liability. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=522.2s)]
*  At the end of the day, the special counsel, the Department of Justice are going to make [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=523.2s)]
*  the judgments that they believe are consistent with the law and the facts. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=526.36s)]
*  And I am comfortable with whatever decisions the special counsel and a grand jury may [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=530.64s)]
*  or may not reach. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  What's your sense of the decision about making certain charges and how that differs between [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  what you did in the impeachment and what Jack Smith has to do? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=542.52s)]
*  Jack Smith's got a clock. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  He's got a president who is recalcitrant, well, a target who is recalcitrant. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=548.04s)]
*  He doesn't want to appear because he's too busy running for office. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=551.72s)]
*  Clearly, if he got his way with Aileen Cannon and this Mar-a-Lago trial were delayed until [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  after the election and he were to win as president, we all know how that'll turn out. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=559.16s)]
*  He's going to say, you can't prosecute me. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=563.44s)]
*  So Jack Smith wants to be able to bring charges that he can get in front of a jury and get [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=566.12s)]
*  done with hopefully before 2025. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=572.32s)]
*  Yeah, what I would say is, and again, it's an important distinction that you raised at [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  the outset, the special counsel has, I suspect, far more evidence available to him and to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  the grand jury than we had when we were prosecuting the impeachment a year and a half ago. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=584.8800000000001s)]
*  Of course, that was the case with respect to the select committee on January 6th as [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=589.6s)]
*  well. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  Much of the evidence that they were able to glean for the American people at a granular [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  level in terms of the events of January 6th and the president's misconduct with respect [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=597.6s)]
*  to provoking the events of that day, we didn't have access to. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=602.24s)]
*  Again, I trust the special counsel to faithfully execute the duties of his office and we're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=606.0s)]
*  going to have to wait and see what potential charges may or may not arise out of that proceeding. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=610.84s)]
*  But we have an impartial and independent justice system for a reason. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=615.08s)]
*  What every one of your viewers should certainly be disheartened by and I think concerned about [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=619.0s)]
*  are the series of ominous videos that you just played because they are consistent with [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  the way in which the president conducted himself when he was in office. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=629.28s)]
*  This constant undermining and attack of the rule of law, which as you know, is sacrosanct [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=632.76s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=637.28s)]
*  Well, it seems to be bleeding into threat now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=638.28s)]
*  The stuff that he said about Aileen Cannon was really a veiled idea that she's a patriot, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  we need more judges who do the right thing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=645.76s)]
*  She's not said that about most judges in cases in which he's being prosecuted or sued. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=648.72s)]
*  This idea about when we come in, we're going to, it used to be drain the swamp. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=653.48s)]
*  It's much more aggressive now. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=657.28s)]
*  Now he calls himself your retribution. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=658.64s)]
*  There's sort of an ugliness around this that we see a little bit of in the House now with [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  the weaponization committee. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=665.64s)]
*  There's this idea that the power of the government could be brought to bear against those who [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=666.92s)]
*  were his opponents or critics. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=671.92s)]
*  And look, that is a direct byproduct of the stranglehold that former president Trump continues [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=673.64s)]
*  to have on the Republican Party writ large. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=678.84s)]
*  His shadow looms large within the House Republican caucus. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=681.6s)]
*  The extremists have unfortunately taken power. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=684.92s)]
*  And you see this every week with these incoherent hearings that they have continued to conduct [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  at the taxpayers' expense. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  You see it in the policies that they are pursuing to restrict freedoms, undermine voting rights, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=695.8s)]
*  and of course, to say nothing of their work to try to undermine the economic progress [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=701.0s)]
*  that our country has made in the last few years under President Biden and congressional [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=704.8s)]
*  Democrats leadership. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=707.76s)]
*  So yes, it's deeply concerning and ominous is probably the best word that I can use to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=708.76s)]
*  describe. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=713.16s)]
*  But if you can get inside Donald Trump's head, which we can't, but it's different, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=714.16s)]
*  We understand why he does this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=719.0s)]
*  And people like Ruth Ben-Giott write books about why dictators become dictators and autocrats [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=721.16s)]
*  become autocrats. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=725.64s)]
*  What's in it for your colleagues in the House, the average House Republican? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=726.84s)]
*  Why do this? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=730.64s)]
*  There are exit ramps and off ramps so often with Donald Trump, the place where you can [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=731.64s)]
*  say this is enough or even like some have said, let's wait to see what the outcome of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=736.0s)]
*  this trial will be. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=740.12s)]
*  But no, everybody jumps both feet in behind Donald Trump and some of this crazy stuff. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=741.52s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think that question devils us all in the House. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=746.28s)]
*  And it's a question that many of us ask ourselves, often certainly a question that we asked ourselves [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=749.96s)]
*  during the course of the impeachment trial. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=754.04s)]
*  When, as you know, only seven Republican senators were willing to choose country over party. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=755.4s)]
*  And do the right thing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=760.64s)]
*  And I don't have a good answer for you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=762.44s)]
*  That's a question that I think we have to pose to Republican members of Congress. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, other Republicans of good faith, who's to tell them to take back their [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=768.24s)]
*  party and, you know, to sort of prevent it from descending into the abyss. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=772.0s)]
*  As unfortunately, it has been on this sort of course for quite some time now. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=777.24s)]
*  What do you know now that you didn't know when you were an impeachment manager around [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=782.28s)]
*  January 6th? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=786.4s)]
*  Because since then, there's been the House January 6th Committee, and then there have [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=787.4s)]
*  been these investigations and the indictment in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=789.56s)]
*  Is there anything that was really key that you didn't know? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=792.48s)]
*  Or do you feel like you had most of the story back then? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=795.04s)]
*  No, I mean, we had a lot of the story. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=797.6s)]
*  But of course, again, as you referenced, the impeachment trial happened within six weeks [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=799.48s)]
*  of January 6th. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=804.24s)]
*  There is a lot that we've learned about the president's conduct during that day that we [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=806.28s)]
*  didn't necessarily know during the course of the trial. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=810.8s)]
*  Just some of the disclosures from example, Ms. Cassidy Hutchinson, who testified in front [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=814.0s)]
*  of the Select Committee on January 6th, very powerful and compelling testimony, and learning [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=818.32s)]
*  some of the facts that she was able to share with the American public, it was jarring for [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  many of us, not just impeachment managers, but I think for many members of Congress, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=827.7600000000001s)]
*  by the way, who all experienced January 6th. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=831.44s)]
*  I was in the House on the House floor that fateful day. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=833.84s)]
*  And so, yeah, I couldn't be more proud of the work that January 6th Select Committee [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=836.7600000000001s)]
*  did in terms of trying to get a better grasp of a lot of the facts that up to that point [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=841.2800000000001s)]
*  had not necessarily been divulged, not even to the members of public, but to members of Congress. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=847.96s)]
*  We've been hearing a lot about democratic backsliding and autocracy in America. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=854.24s)]
*  If you want to get a real idea of what that looks like, take a look at what's happening [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=858.2s)]
*  in Tennessee. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=861.44s)]
*  You'll remember a few months ago, the Republican supermajority in the state legislature drew [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=862.44s)]
*  national attention for expelling two black Democrat lawmakers. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=867.4000000000001s)]
*  That same Republican supermajority also started taking aim at the state's largest and largely [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=871.64s)]
*  Democratic city, Nashville, by trying to cut its governing council in half against [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=875.9s)]
*  the will of the voters. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=880.9s)]
*  Now, Tennessee is a red state. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=881.9s)]
*  In 2020, Donald Trump won it with 61% of the vote. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=884.54s)]
*  But thanks to gerrymandering, Tennessee Republicans in the Senate control 82% of the seats and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=888.06s)]
*  76% of the state House. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=894.74s)]
*  And that Republican supermajority is using its power to pass laws like one of the most [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=897.56s)]
*  stringent abortion bans in the country and statewide restrictions on drag performances, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=901.92s)]
*  which a court later blocked as unconstitutional. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=907.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, it was not always like this, as Ann Applebaum writes in the Atlantic, quote, not so long [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  ago, Tennessee was not merely a more bipartisan state, but a model of bipartisanship, which [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  in the 80s and 90s was ruled by moderate Democrats and liberal Republicans. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=921.28s)]
*  But today, Tennessee is a model of one party rule, end quote. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=925.36s)]
*  Joining me now is Ann Applebaum, Pulitzer Prize winning historian and staff writer at [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=931.04s)]
*  the Atlantic. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=934.48s)]
*  And good evening to you. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=935.48s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=936.48s)]
*  You recently spent time in Tennessee reporting on this story. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=937.48s)]
*  Tell me about what you found because you are, we know you for studying real autocracies [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=940.56s)]
*  in places where democracy has struggled around the world. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=945.4s)]
*  Why Tennessee and what did you learn? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=948.6s)]
*  First of all, it's a little tongue in cheek. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=952.04s)]
*  So Tennessee is part of the United States. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=953.8s)]
*  The Constitution applies. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=956.24s)]
*  The Bill of Rights applies. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=957.6s)]
*  Tennessee is a lovely town. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=960.16s)]
*  There's no central European gloom. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=961.36s)]
*  It's not Budapest on the Cumberland. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=963.68s)]
*  But you do see in Tennessee what is the effect of one party rule. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=966.52s)]
*  And there are ways in which it is reminiscent of what happens in other countries, other [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=971.8399999999999s)]
*  societies when you have the same phenomenon. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's a technical explanation for it or a technical reason why this is true. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=978.4s)]
*  When you have a heavily gerrymandered state and when you have, as Tennessee does, very [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=987.24s)]
*  strict laws about voting, it's actually got one of the lowest voting rates in the country, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=995.44s)]
*  maybe the lowest, depending on how you count. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=999.4s)]
*  That means that lawmakers are dependent on a really tiny number of people to get elected. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1002.0s)]
*  And very often those are the most partisan and the most radical in the state. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1007.96s)]
*  And so you get people whose really only constituents, the only people they care about are the radicals. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1011.96s)]
*  And that creates that kind of atmosphere. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1017.96s)]
*  But there's a kind of existential thing that happens as well, which is that when you're [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1020.6s)]
*  in charge of everything and the Republicans are in charge of everything in Tennessee, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1024.08s)]
*  you know, the state legislature, the governors, they appoint all the court positions, there's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1027.04s)]
*  a kind of frustration that sets in as people say, well, we run everything, but we still [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1033.76s)]
*  can't get everything to be the way we want it to be. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1038.28s)]
*  And then you get a kind of radicalization. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's almost as if when you're in control, when you have everything, you don't become [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1043.6s)]
*  nicer and more considerate of other people's views. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1048.68s)]
*  You actually become more radicalized. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's a phenomenon I've seen in other countries. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1055.52s)]
*  And we saw it and can see it in Tennessee and, of course, not only there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1058.28s)]
*  So now we're back full circle to talking about Eastern Europe and places, Central Europe, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1061.44s)]
*  places that you studied, because I always wonder about this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1065.28s)]
*  Once you're in charge of the whole thing, don't you get all laid back and are nicer [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1067.76s)]
*  about the whole thing because you actually have control and you can be benevolent dictators. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1071.1s)]
*  But your research indicates not necessarily so, or at least not necessarily so in Tennessee. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1074.82s)]
*  No, I mean, the experience of total control, especially right now when you have a part [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1082.02s)]
*  of the Republican Party, a part of the voters in Tennessee who are now very, very concerned [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1087.78s)]
*  about social issues. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1096.26s)]
*  They they follow very closely national media. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1097.62s)]
*  A lot of people in Nashville kept saying to me, oh, all politics is national now. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1100.7s)]
*  People used to say all politics is local, but people are very influenced by what they [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1104.7s)]
*  see on television. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1108.8200000000002s)]
*  They want real results. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1110.42s)]
*  They want to achieve things. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1112.14s)]
*  They want to they see things on Fox News and they want it to happen in Tennessee. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1113.3000000000002s)]
*  And of course, people don't have that kind of power. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1116.8200000000002s)]
*  And this creates a kind of frustration. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1119.18s)]
*  And so people become more radical. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1121.3000000000002s)]
*  They say we need more power. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1122.9s)]
*  We need to silence our opponents. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1124.14s)]
*  As we saw, you mentioned that the legislators being thrown out a few months ago. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1126.46s)]
*  That's that's now you know, that's a reflection of the frustration that the ruling party has [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1132.3s)]
*  that it's not able to do the extreme things that it's most partisan voters want it to do. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1137.86s)]
*  I'm curious about this, because when you say most politics are national now, this makes a lot of [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1145.6599999999999s)]
*  sense when you think about book bands and drag shows and things like that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1150.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, anybody who grew up in a city anywhere knows that there have always been drag shows and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1153.98s)]
*  they can have an effect on your life or not, depending on what you choose. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1157.78s)]
*  Most people who are involved in these book bands have not read the books that they're banning. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1160.7s)]
*  So I'm always curious as to what's the motivation behind rank and file Republicans supporting [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1164.3s)]
*  their elected members who are going down the road of dealing with these social issues when, in [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1170.54s)]
*  fact, there are real issues in Tennessee that I would assume I want my state legislature to be [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1175.7s)]
*  dealing with. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1181.5s)]
*  Yeah, and Tennessee, as you said again in your introduction, was a was a model of bipartisanship [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1182.9s)]
*  where a lot of things did get done. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1187.74s)]
*  Nashville is a really successful city. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1189.14s)]
*  There's a lot of investment there. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1190.74s)]
*  You know, international investment companies from all over the country go there to set up [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1191.94s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1196.74s)]
*  But what the voters are seeing, they're seeing these kind of headline culture war issues, and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1198.18s)]
*  that's what they see on TV. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1204.94s)]
*  And that's what is motivating them to vote. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1206.14s)]
*  And they want their legislators to do something about it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1209.54s)]
*  And so you get these extreme actions, you know, these whether, as I said, whether it's book [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1212.34s)]
*  banning or whether it's unconstitutional laws about drag queens that can overturn by the federal [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1217.54s)]
*  courts. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1224.14s)]
*  The point of enacting those things is to kind of rev up the base, get people going, show that [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1224.54s)]
*  we're fighting the culture war, but not necessarily to they don't necessarily achieve much. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1231.74s)]
*  They don't change the lives of people in the state. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1238.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's the way politics is going in a lot of American states. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwmvmHjn5mM&t=1240.54s)]
