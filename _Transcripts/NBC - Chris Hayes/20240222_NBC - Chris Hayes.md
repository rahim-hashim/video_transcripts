# Fox host says Black people will back Trump because ‘they love sneakers’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks)
*  If you want to know what Trump campaign staffers think about you, just watch Fox News like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=0.0s)]
*  this weekend when they gushed over Donald Trump's new ploy for money, a limited edition [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  series of gaudy gold $400 Trump sneakers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=10.76s)]
*  And like they always do on Fox, somebody said the quiet part out loud on what the big sneaker [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=15.52s)]
*  strategy is really all about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=20.66s)]
*  Even the sneaker thing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=24.46s)]
*  I was on social media last night. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=25.48s)]
*  Very interesting as you see black support eroding from Joe Biden. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=27.86s)]
*  This is connecting with black America because they love sneakers or into sneakers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=33.3s)]
*  They love that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=37.1s)]
*  You know, this is a big deal, certainly in the inner city. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=38.1s)]
*  So when you have Trump roll out his sneaker line, they're like, wait a minute. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=41.0s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=44.68s)]
*  He's reaching them on a level that defies and is above politics. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=45.68s)]
*  The culture always trumps politics and Trump understands culture like no politician I've [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=49.78s)]
*  ever seen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=55.06s)]
*  Seriously, why didn't I think of this when I ran the RNC? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=56.06s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  Black folks love sneakers and we can paint them gold. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=64.76s)]
*  This can't miss. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=69.86s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=72.1s)]
*  It's a big miss and they ugly as hell. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=73.18s)]
*  Angela Carzon watches a lot of Fox as the president and CEO of Media Matters for America. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=77.26s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=84.02s)]
*  Four hundred dollar kicks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=85.82s)]
*  Gold. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Are they really the cynical over there at Fox? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=90.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=92.3s)]
*  And you know, this same guy about a year ago when Trump's mugshot came out said that black [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=93.3s)]
*  people can quote relate to Donald Trump now and that it was actually going to increase [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=97.46s)]
*  his black support because he had quote street cred. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=101.62s)]
*  This is the same guy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=104.02s)]
*  So in some way, this is not just a one off. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=105.58s)]
*  This is part of a pattern from him and Fox News more broadly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=108.82s)]
*  It just yeah, you know, the mugshot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=112.26s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that works for us, too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  We're used to seeing Fox do these types of things. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=117.7s)]
*  We're used to seeing them demonize minorities and sort of play up the sort of racial angle [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  on these things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=125.5s)]
*  It gets worse each time, though, seemingly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=128.68s)]
*  Their audience really sucks this stuff in and just sort of takes it and goes, yeah, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  that's this will work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=136.62s)]
*  Black people now follow Donald Trump and because they'll get a pair of sneakers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=137.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because they tend to have it both ways. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=141.82s)]
*  Most of the time, they're demonizing black people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=144.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=146.1s)]
*  So just a few weeks ago, they actually blamed the 737, the Boeing door that popped out. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=147.1s)]
*  They blamed that on Boeing allowing too many black people to work on airplanes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  That was not just one Fox News show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=156.38s)]
*  That was an entire day of Fox News coverage. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=158.16s)]
*  That was an argument that they made and their audience completely consumed it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=160.82s)]
*  And that's a reflection of what they say to them every day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=163.76s)]
*  But then they have these one offs where they actually get excited about the idea and this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  false narrative that somehow Trump is capturing all sorts of people across the country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=170.38s)]
*  That it's not just limited to his MAGA support base. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  So here's some racist narratives Fox passed along just off the top of my head. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=179.62s)]
*  Birth-a-rism, Obama phones, migrant caravans stealing jobs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=184.46s)]
*  They just had to apologize for a live broadcast showing the guardian angels roughing up a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=189.46s)]
*  guy they said was a migrant who actually is from the Bronx. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=193.54s)]
*  What I miss. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Most recently, it's claims that they are trying to secretly replace the national anthem. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  That that's a big part of it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=206.9s)]
*  That they've been sort of... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=208.06s)]
*  Oh, it's because we sing at the national black anthem. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=209.06s)]
*  And it's part of a larger conspiracy to dilute white power. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Lift every voice and sing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  It is a huge problem and they're really worried about this because they've heard it played [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  a lot more regularly and they think there's some conspiracy going on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  They tie them into the sort of the larger white genocide great replacement theory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=222.94s)]
*  In sort of the Fox News world, they're actually the henchmen for the great powers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=227.38s)]
*  Mostly Jewish people that are actually helping bring in all the immigrants. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=231.74s)]
*  They're helping perpetuate this through their sports and their culture. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  So those are the two big ones more recently that you've missed at Fox. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=236.94s)]
*  Somehow it just amazes me that people actually believe that singing the national black anthem, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=240.62s)]
*  lift every voice and sing is threatening to white life here in America. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=248.46s)]
*  I want to move on a little bit further into the abyss with the MyPillow guy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  He, of election denying fame, Mike Lindell used ads that basically were all over the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=260.94s)]
*  network offering $5 million to anyone who could go out there and disprove his election [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=269.74s)]
*  fraud claims. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  He caught the car. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  He did. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  Someone actually disproved his claims. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  Now he's doing the backstroke and trying to get a judge to get him off the hook. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=282.78s)]
*  What's wrong here? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=289.18s)]
*  What does that say that he thought he could actually get away with the big lie like that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=291.18s)]
*  Part of it is that he got high on his own supply. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=296.62s)]
*  He believed to a degree that he could manifest this through enough resources. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  Why wouldn't he believe that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=305.34s)]
*  He was Fox's single largest advertiser for years and the result of that was just through [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=306.34s)]
*  force of will, he was able to push all kinds of nonsensical conspiracies into Chicanery, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=310.7s)]
*  not just into Fox, but into the right wing echo chamber. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  So he had had the track record of using his money and his resources to manifest false [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=317.18s)]
*  narratives into reality and Trump was a conduit for that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=321.42s)]
*  So in this instance, he gets out there and says, nobody can prove me wrong $5 million [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=323.94s)]
*  and he just assumes that he can bluster and might make his right way through it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a little listen of Mr. Lindell. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=332.02s)]
*  And the media is all down at that end just attacking me from around the world, but I'm [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  welcoming it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=339.62s)]
*  I'm telling them, hey, we have to get rid of the electronic voting machines that go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=341.54s)]
*  to paper ballots and count it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  And I do want to say Steve, my pillow, my pillow, thanks all of you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=346.3s)]
*  We put our bathrobes on sale, 100% USA, subpoena cotton. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=350.46s)]
*  The grift is always on. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=358.06s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=359.06s)]
*  No matter how bad it gets, I got a grift. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=360.06s)]
*  I mean, that seems to be the end game at the end of the day that, you know, I've got this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=362.18s)]
*  audience and I'm going to lie to them and they're going to give me cash. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=366.22s)]
*  Part of what's happening is that because of what we talked about earlier, they've become [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=369.82000000000005s)]
*  increasingly less commercially viable because of their extremism. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=372.86s)]
*  They have to become a closed system, just like Alex Jones, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=375.74s)]
*  He tells people that there's all this estrogen in the water and you have to buy these eye [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=378.32000000000005s)]
*  drops to put into your drinks that takes the estrogen out of it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=381.26000000000005s)]
*  It's a closed system and the rest of the right-wing media is following suit. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  Lindell is just one part of that puzzle. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=387.42s)]
*  Yeah, one part of it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWSaEV059ks&t=389.22s)]
