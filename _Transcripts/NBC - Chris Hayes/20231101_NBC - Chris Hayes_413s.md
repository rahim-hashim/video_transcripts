# George Santos 'easily' survives vote to expel him from Congress
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes a vote to expel freshman congressman George Santos just failed in the House for representative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=0.0s)]
*  It did not come close to meeting the constitutionally required [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  2-thirds [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=10.48s)]
*  Threshold to expel a member of Congress [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=11.64s)]
*  It should be said the expulsion bar is very high to clear and for good reason only five congressmen have been successfully [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=14.14s)]
*  Expelled in our country's history. It has not happened in more than 20 years [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=20.96s)]
*  The New York Republican George Santos has been a subject of almost too much controversy to list in a one-hour show [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=25.5s)]
*  Since he was first elected to Congress nearly one year ago in that time [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=31.82s)]
*  We'll go briefly here reporting revealed that Santos fabricated much of his resume including business and educational experience [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=35.5s)]
*  The fact that he was like a champion volleyball player as well as personal connection to a number of national tragedies including 9-eleven [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=42.3s)]
*  And then there's the fact that Santos was also indicted earlier this year in May [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=49.06s)]
*  Before then getting hit with additional [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=53.86s)]
*  superseding charges last month bringing the total up to 23 felony charges he now faces which include [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=56.22s)]
*  Aggravated identity theft wire fraud and credit card fraud [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=63.5s)]
*  We should note Santos denies all those charges and he deserves the chance to mount a vigorous defense against them in court as is his [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=67.02s)]
*  Constitutional right is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=73.9s)]
*  Campaign treasurer we should note who has also caught up in this case has already pleaded guilty which doesn't bode great for Santos [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=75.56s)]
*  But none of that was really the question at hand tonight [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=82.26s)]
*  The question was whether Santos is fit to serve in Congress and this was always an uphill climb [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=84.74s)]
*  In fact if tonight's vote had been successful [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=90.42s)]
*  Samantha Santos would have been the first member of Congress to be expelled without a criminal conviction since the Civil War [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=92.82s)]
*  The process is so rare because expulsion requires a two-thirds majority of the house a level of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Unanimity that this body or frankly any legislative body has an extraordinarily difficult time reaching [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=105.78s)]
*  Interestingly, this is the second time this year that an attempt has been made to expel Santos [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Democrats first tried to remove him six months ago after he was first indicted [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=116.92s)]
*  Republicans instead referred to Santa referred Santos to the House Ethics Committee in attempt to sweep the problem under the rug [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  Tonight it was Republicans leaving the charge to remove Santos [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=128.24s)]
*  The efforts was pushed by Republican Congressman Anthony Desposito of New York along with four other New York Republicans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=132.24s)]
*  Mike Lawler Nick Lola Mark Molinaro and Brandon Williams now all five of those men have something in common [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=138.6s)]
*  They have all been vocal Santos critics [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=146.88s)]
*  They all previously supported kicking the issue the exits committee instead of a proper expulsion vote and they're all running for re-election in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=149.32s)]
*  districts that Joe Biden carried [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  The Ethics Committee has not yet released a report on Santos. So what changed? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, all five of those New York congressmen voted to elect the new MAGA speaker of the House Mike Johnson and well elevating a pro-coo [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  anti-abortion arguably Christian nationalists the speakership could be seen as something of a vulnerability for those gentlemen in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  competitive New York districts [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  So it's not difficult to imagine what that they might want a distraction from their culpability in electing MAGA Mike Johnson tonight [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  Trying and failing to remove George Santos was that distraction? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=188.56s)]
*  On this vote the yeas are 179 the nays are 213 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  With 19 recorded as present two-thirds not voting in the affirmative [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=199.52s)]
*  The resolution is not adopted and a motion to reconsider is laid upon the table [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=204.56s)]
*  I love you. Telly covers Congress for NBC News and she joins me now the wild day in the house, sir. Allie [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=211.4s)]
*  How did it all go down? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything else in the house lately Chris all of them are wild days [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=219.4s)]
*  I think with Santos at least the Republicans in New York can now go home and say they tried [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=223.52s)]
*  I mean this was always going to be a long shot for them [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=228.74s)]
*  We watched the fact that even more than 30 Democrats voted not to expel Santos only 20 some odd [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  Republicans did vote to expel him among them those key five New York Republican lawmakers. That's important to their reelection battles [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  I think you're right to point all of that out because the politics is so inextricably linked with the personnel decisions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=247.76s)]
*  They've been made in this building right now [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=255.3s)]
*  And I think that for Santos the reason Republicans have slow-walked this for so long is because their majority is already [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=257.08s)]
*  Razor-thin it would be like going from a three blade razor to a two blade razor and they need all of the shave that they can [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=264.04s)]
*  Get so this is not something they're willing to go along with easily [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=270.64s)]
*  It's why we've seen even just in the last few minutes speaker Johnson walked by me just two minutes before I came on the air [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=274.6s)]
*  with you and I asked him if speaker if [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=280.08s)]
*  Santos should be expelled and he sort of shook his head and laughed at me for even asking the question [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=282.68s)]
*  That's the way that most leadership have dealt with this from McCarthy through Johnson now [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=288.12s)]
*  I don't mean to be overly cynical here, but it just seems transparent to me what happened [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=293.24s)]
*  Which is that Johnson got unanimity from the caucus everyone in the Republican Party voted for him [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=299.1s)]
*  There are five members in New York who have a real uphill battle. They a bunch of a vote from a voter for Jordan [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=304.86s)]
*  They just voted for Mike Johnson [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=310.64s)]
*  They have to come back to their district and say something about why they are not like the rest of those other Republicans [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=311.7s)]
*  You may not like district that went plus by eight Biden plus eight and this was engineered [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=319.64s)]
*  Essentially to give those gentlemen cover I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=326.06s)]
*  Think that that's one way of looking at it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  and I think that that's probably the right way of looking at it because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=332.18s)]
*  This is all about getting political cover to make sure that the majority can a be maintained in the short term [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  Because there's a special election and you got to imagine those voters on Long Island are not going to be easily voting for another [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=343.94s)]
*  Republican again, so Republicans would rather take the short-term pain and have the long-term gain of the one seat [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=350.14s)]
*  That's in their four or five seat majority as it exists already [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  But yeah for a lot of these folks mark Molinaro, for example, I'm from that area that Hudson Valley area [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=359.82s)]
*  I'm technically my parents are in the Lawler district now [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  But I know that area well the fact that Molinaro [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  voted for Jim Jordan twice and then went along with the rest of his conference and voted for Johnson is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=371.06s)]
*  Definitely something that voters at home are going to have questions about the election denialism central to those questions [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=376.82s)]
*  But certainly that's what this Republican majority has said [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=382.78s)]
*  They're fine with and I think that you sort of have to take them at face value on that that that is a feature [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=386.14s)]
*  Not a bug of this conference [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=391.02s)]
*  You [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dBxa4wdj4&t=406.7s)]
