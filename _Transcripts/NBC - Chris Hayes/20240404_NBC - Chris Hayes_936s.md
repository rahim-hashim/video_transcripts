# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got news tonight on two of the criminal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=0.0s)]
*  cases against Donald Trump in New York. The judge overseeing Trump's hush money election [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=4.08s)]
*  interference trial just denied the ex-president's latest bid to delay based on his, frankly, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=9.32s)]
*  bogus claim of presidential immunity for his hush money payment. So that case is full steam [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  ahead. The trial is now set to begin in less than two weeks on April 15th. It really looks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=21.84s)]
*  like it's going to happen. Meanwhile, the case about Trump's reckless mishandling of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=26.28s)]
*  classified documents and then obstruction of justice and trying to cover up that activity, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=30.8s)]
*  well that is still dragging thanks almost exclusively to district court judge Aileen [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=35.68s)]
*  Cannon, that woman there. Now, Cannon was 39 years old when she got the lifetime position [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=40.84s)]
*  she was appointed to, not particularly distinguished at the time. And she was appointed that position, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=45.72s)]
*  in fact, in the lame duck session after the election by the accused document mishandler [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=51.28s)]
*  in this case, Donald Trump. And this situation may finally now be coming to a head. In a striking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=57.32s)]
*  new filing, special counsel Jack Smith hinted that he may ask a higher court, the court of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=64.16s)]
*  appeals above Judge Cannon, to correct her because of how badly she has mishandled the case. This [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=69.64s)]
*  has been building for a long time. Remember, we first met Aileen Cannon back in 2022 in the wake [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  of the FBI's first search of Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago. And Judge Cannon ended up sort of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=82.4s)]
*  issuing a ruling that was wildly favorable to Donald Trump. She stepped in and she stopped the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=88.2s)]
*  process of the government going through the search records and instead appointed a special [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  master to review the SEAD documents, which blocked the government's investigation. And [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=100.76s)]
*  people were really taken aback by this ruling. Experts blasted it, calling it corrupt and lawless. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=105.28s)]
*  And then an appeals court quickly reversed it, including some Trump appointed judges above her, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=110.96s)]
*  3-0. But then, as luck would have it, Aileen Cannon was later randomly assigned to the actual [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=116.16s)]
*  criminal case once the charges were brought in June of last year. And at every turn since then, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=123.12s)]
*  she has appeared to be in over her head while also bending over backwards to rule in Trump's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  favor and slow walking any progress towards a trial. And today we may have finally reached [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=133.72s)]
*  the breaking point that could bring about the end of the Aileen Cannon experiment. It could all come [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=138.64s)]
*  tumbling down because of Donald Trump's ludicrous argument that the classified documents, the highly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=145.04s)]
*  classified documents, the nation's secrets found in his personal possession are actually his to do [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=151.48s)]
*  with it as he pleases. Of course, that is not what the law says. The thing you understand here is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=156.6s)]
*  the current law around presidential records goes back to the 1970s. This is not ancient history. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=162.32s)]
*  We don't have to investigate what the founders thought, okay? When Richard Nixon resigned in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=167.0s)]
*  the wake of the Watergate scandal, because he was both corrupt and greedy, Nixon wanted to take [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  documents and those infamous Nixon tapes home with him to Florida as his own personal possessions so [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=177.88s)]
*  he could use them for his own personal benefit. I mean, the records were highly valuable. They [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=184.28s)]
*  could be sold for profit, or they could be donated for huge tax write offs. At one point, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=188.96s)]
*  there was even the possibility that the tapes would be burned onto records for sale. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=194.12s)]
*  We're told there will be a rush to see who can get them out first since it is thought the first [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=199.08s)]
*  records on the market will sell a million copies or more. And we might guess that soon after some [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=205.24s)]
*  record producer will set the Nixon conversations to music, flutes and cellos perhaps, or a 60 piece [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=211.16s)]
*  band playing Hail to the Chief, and then try to get them played on the radio, most likely the Rock [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=217.84s)]
*  Station since this material may not qualify as classical. Eventually, Nixon, relaxing in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=223.8s)]
*  San Clemente, might turn on the radio and find he has made the top 40. Basically like the Trump [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=229.8s)]
*  high top sneakers 40 years ahead of its time, 50 years ahead of time. So a few months after Nixon's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  resignation, his successor Gerald Ford signed the first measure that was intended at protecting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=242.12s)]
*  those records. That was called the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=246.48s)]
*  White House sources said today that President Ford will sign a bill passed by the Congress giving [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  custody of the Nixon tapes and papers to the federal government. The bill nullifies an agreement [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=257.08s)]
*  between Nixon and the Ford administration, which would give the former president possession of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  tapes and documents. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=266.76s)]
*  Again, that didn't end things. In fact, the fight over Nixon's records, what he called his records, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=268.52s)]
*  actually the US's records, that went on for decades. It only concluded with an $18 million [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=274.44s)]
*  settlement between the federal government and the former president's estate in the year 2000. But it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=279.56s)]
*  only took a few years for legislation to come together afterwards that established the rules that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=285.64s)]
*  would then govern all future official records. Right? We never want this Nixon thing to happen [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=290.44s)]
*  again. We don't want people absconding from the White House with like records brimming out of their [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=295.52s)]
*  pockets. So we're going to pass the Presidential Records Act, which was signed into law by President [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=300.52s)]
*  Jimmy Carter in 1978. And the Presidential Records Act explicitly established that presidential [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  records are the property of us, the American people, not the individual in the White House. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=311.68s)]
*  Quote, the United States shall reserve and retain complete ownership, possession and control of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  presidential records. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  This is black letter law, extremely clear, extremely well established. And the records we're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=324.96s)]
*  talking about here, remember our classified documents, not like something that he like doodled [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=330.04s)]
*  as a, you know, or a painting he made as a gift for someone. But Donald Trump has been arguing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=334.12s)]
*  consistently that the Presidential Records Act, which we just gave you the history of, actually [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=341.56s)]
*  means the exact opposite of what it says. That the Presidential Records Act actually means that the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=347.24s)]
*  official records from his presidency are his private property to take. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=352.68s)]
*  I can't imagine you ever saying, bring me some of the boxes that we brought back from the White House. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=357.0s)]
*  I'd like to look at them. Did you ever do that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=363.64s)]
*  I would have the right to do that. There's nothing wrong with it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=365.4s)]
*  But I know you, I don't think you would do it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I don't have a lot of time, but I would have the right to do that. I would do that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  All right, let me move on. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  Remember this. This is the Presidential Records Act. I have the right to take stuff. Do you know that they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=375.24s)]
*  ended up paying Richard Nixon, I think $18 million for what he had. They did the Presidential Records [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=382.28s)]
*  Act. I have the right to take stuff. I have the right to look at stuff. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=387.88s)]
*  No, no, you don't. No, that's the opposite. Let's just do this again. They paid him 18 million [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  because the Presidential Records Act didn't apply at the time because it hadn't been passed. But to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=397.64s)]
*  make sure that never happened again, they passed and signed the Presidential Records Act, which [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  says literally the opposite. Okay. As political science professor Seth Maskett put it, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=405.48s)]
*  it's like saying the Brady bill gave every American a handgun. Now, Donald Trump can say [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  whatever he wants in Fox News interviews, but in a legal setting, this argument should get laughed [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=419.0s)]
*  out of court. Trump's lawyers have actually made this claim in court to Judge Cannon that the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  Presidential Records Act gives Trump the authority to decide whether a record is personal or [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=429.48s)]
*  presidential, that he could do this like magical transubstantiation where he waves his hand over [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=434.92s)]
*  a document. Well, that's personal. Special Counsel Jack Smith basically said that is ludicrous, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=440.12s)]
*  calling it a fundamentally fraud legal premise. Okay. Black and white issue. What did Judge Aileen [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=446.04s)]
*  Cannon do? Well, get this because it's weird. Her decision was to tell both sides, Trump's lawyers [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=453.16s)]
*  and Smith to write instructions to the jury, each based on their interpretation of the law. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=460.68s)]
*  So the idea is that Jack Smith's team would draft jury instructions with the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=466.36s)]
*  correct interpretation of the law and Donald Trump's team would draft them with the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=470.44s)]
*  completely wrong opposite interpretation of the law and then Judge Cannon would decide which one [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=475.64s)]
*  to use. So like maybe there'd be a jury instruction being like, just so you know, before we do this, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=481.72s)]
*  Presidential Records Act means the opposite of what it clearly says. Got that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=486.68s)]
*  For this reason, Cannon's order that they both go and draft their own jury instructions was met [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  with near universal condemnation again, not the first time this has happened to her, from judges [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=498.52s)]
*  and lawyers and the prosecutors in Jack Smith's office. Now Smith is taking a clear stand, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=503.4s)]
*  essentially telling Judge Cannon, if she indulges this wildly lawless argument that Donald Trump [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=509.0s)]
*  can take whatever he wants because the Presidential Records Act says though, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=513.8s)]
*  an argument that's literally opposite of the law, that he may seek Judge Cannon's removal, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=518.12s)]
*  which would be an extraordinary step. It's an explicit threat and it means that this case against [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=522.5999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is coming to a head in a really explosive way. What is the purpose of this filing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=527.24s)]
*  that Jack Smith filed in response to Judge Cannon? So for starters, Chris, it's just what you say [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=535.16s)]
*  that the law that she's entertaining is ludicrous, that position. Moreover, it's got no basis in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  facts. He's never even tried to assert, but there's an extra important step here that makes this really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=549.56s)]
*  aggressive because what's been really vexing about Cannon is she has again and again just refused to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=555.08s)]
*  rule, period. And this kind of academic exercise, let's talk about jury instructions, not only [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=563.16s)]
*  avoids a ruling, which is what you need to take things on appeal, but even suggests she might do [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=569.8s)]
*  this kind of mischief at trial after which double jeopardy would prevent a retrial. So what Smith [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=575.56s)]
*  says is everything you say, but one step more. He is saying you have to decide this, Judge Cannon, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=582.52s)]
*  and you have to decide it in plenty of time for us to appeal. And if you don't, if you continue to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=589.88s)]
*  dither, then we are going to mandamus you for the very act of not deciding. So far you haven't given [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=597.48s)]
*  us enough to latch onto, but guess what? If you continue to not give it to us, we are going to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=604.76s)]
*  mandamus that very point. And as you said, you have an 11th Circuit, I think, pretty well primed [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=610.6s)]
*  by her previous conduct to know something is amiss. So they're calling out not just the law, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=616.2s)]
*  but her whole cat and mouse game of not issuing decisions. Yeah, the way you say it in the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=621.64s)]
*  column, because I want to read just to underline this point, that the Judge Cannon's Alice in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=627.08s)]
*  Winterland antics seemed designed to avoid issuing a ruling that prosecutors could appeal while also [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  setting the stage for her adopt Trump's ridiculous claims after a jury has been impaneled, which could [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=635.96s)]
*  be a fatal blow to Smith's case, because once a jury is selected, even a ridiculous order can bring [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  prosecution to a hard stop because the Constitution's double jeopardy clause precludes retrial. It would [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=645.64s)]
*  be the judicial equivalent of a perfect crime. Christy, again, some of this stuff is complicated [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=651.08s)]
*  and I'm not going to pretend that I feel like I know it really well, but the basics here do seem to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=657.48s)]
*  me almost bewilderingly clear insofar as the Presidential Records Act obviously cannot mean, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  obviously, what his lawyers are saying it means and indulging it seems ludicrous. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=676.6s)]
*  It does. It seems as though the Presidential Records Act in this context, it's like if you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=685.0s)]
*  were taking a law school exam, this would be what we'd call a red herring. It's completely irrelevant [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=691.64s)]
*  and it's really something that Trump's defense is trying to use to divert from really the main issue, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=698.36s)]
*  which is whether or not he violated the Espionage Act. Not only is she failing that law school exam [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=703.72s)]
*  by kind of engaging with this red herring, but to continue with the analogy, she won't even hand in [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=710.84s)]
*  the exam to get graded because she won't decide the actual issue. She keeps holding back and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=715.88s)]
*  reserving decision and kind of having this weird proposed jury instruction where it's almost choose [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  your own adventure, whether the jury decides if they're personal records or whether it's Donald [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=728.28s)]
*  Trump decided they were personal records. Either way, under either scenario she has, he's somehow [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=733.24s)]
*  entitled to have kept them, which is obviously wrong under the law. What Jack Smith is saying is [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=739.08s)]
*  it's time. You've got to make a decision. You need to make a decision promptly, well in advance of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  trial so that if you get it this wrong, again, we need to take this up to the 11th Circuit. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=751.64s)]
*  Right. That's a really important point, which is that the interpretation is ludicrous on his face [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=757.96s)]
*  and also immaterial to the law that controls here, which is the Espionage Act, which is that this is [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=761.24s)]
*  national defense information plain as day and you had it and you were like, so that there you go. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=765.72s)]
*  And we asked for it back and you didn't give it to us. So let's talk about the New York case, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=773.08s)]
*  Harry. I'm going to come back to you, Christy, which is Judge Murchon there doing the opposite [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=777.48s)]
*  of Judge Cannon in this sense, which is ruling on this immunity, this sort of immunity Hail Mary. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=782.36s)]
*  He basically said that he waited too long to raise the issue that there's so clearly last minute. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  He denied Trump's motion delay the trial start date until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on this [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=794.6s)]
*  immunity claim in federal election interference case in Washington, D.C. All that seems to mean [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=799.0s)]
*  we're on for April 15th as of now. Is that your understanding, Harry? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=804.2s)]
*  Exactly right. And it's more than that. Remember, this is what he was able to leverage in other [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  settings to get a delay. Well, what Murchon has said is I'm not going to entertain it. You are [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=815.32s)]
*  late. Moreover, you are so late. I doubt this is very dramatic language in the order. I doubt the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=820.76s)]
*  sincerity and purpose of what you're doing. You have just basically waited till the last minute [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=827.16s)]
*  to try to delay things. I'm not even going to consider it because it's untimely. And really, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=832.76s)]
*  I don't think he has cards left to play. We are, as you say, you know, 10, 12 days away from picking [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=838.36s)]
*  a jury in the first ever criminal trial of a former president. Christy, is that your read as well? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=844.2s)]
*  I agree with Harry. Looking at the opinion, we are seeing the judge really get stronger and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=851.88s)]
*  stronger in his language with each one of these frivolous motions from Donald Trump's defense team, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=858.12s)]
*  starting out with the discovery violations, which turned out to be a nothing burger. There were no [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=864.44s)]
*  discovery violations. Then we had the motion for recusal, which again had already been [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=868.2800000000001s)]
*  brought in August of 2023. They had nothing new to say, but they brought it up again at the 11th [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=873.88s)]
*  hour to try to delay this trial. And now we're seeing with this motion for presidential immunity, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=878.84s)]
*  which is completely untimely. And the court is calling out what it is, says the circumstances [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=885.72s)]
*  of this really tests the court's credulity here. You know, it's clear what you're doing. What you're [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=891.56s)]
*  doing is just trying to delay this thing, and he's not going to entertain it anymore. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=896.76s)]
*  Harry Lippman, Christy Greenberg, thank you both. Appreciate it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=901.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blujqXbV6IU&t=931.64s)]
