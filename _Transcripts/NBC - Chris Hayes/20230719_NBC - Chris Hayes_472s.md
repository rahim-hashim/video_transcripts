Video Description: “Nobody is ever prepared, and they think they are going to be the exception. And they don’t listen to the warning signs until it’s too late,” says Ruth Ben-Ghiat, history professor and author. “Authoritarians always tell you what they are going to do as a kind of challenge and as a warning – and people don’t listen until it’s too late.”

# Trump's ongoing threat to American democracy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo)
*  Donald Trump tried to steal our democracy and he's still trying to do it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=0.0s)]
*  For those who do not understand the ramifications of all this, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=3.2s)]
*  let me paint a picture of what could happen next. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=6.0s)]
*  Let's say Trump does not get prosecuted for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=8.8s)]
*  or the prosecution and the trial get delayed beyond 2024, beyond the election, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  and he becomes president again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=17.6s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=19.2s)]
*  Well, there's no real need to guess. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  He's already telling us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=22.2s)]
*  When I get back into the Oval Office, I will totally obliterate the deep state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=24.6s)]
*  They will be obliterated. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=29.8s)]
*  And we know all the good ones now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=34.2s)]
*  2024 is our final battle. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=36.0s)]
*  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=39.0s)]
*  We will expel the warmongers from our government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=41.8s)]
*  We will drive out the globalists. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=45.6s)]
*  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, fascists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=47.8s)]
*  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=51.6s)]
*  Now, these are not empty words. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=56.2s)]
*  The ex-president and his allies have specific plans, as the New York Times reports, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=57.4s)]
*  for a, quote, sweeping expansion of presidential power, end quote, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=61.4s)]
*  and, quote, to bring independent agencies under presidential control. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=66.0s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to destroy our democracy, and if he is not prosecuted and reelected, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=71.2s)]
*  he's likely to try to finish the job. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=75.4s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott is a professor of history at New York University. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=77.4s)]
*  She's the author of Strongmen, Mussolini to the Present. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=80.2s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=83.0s)]
*  Ruth, let's just start with this reporting in the New York Times, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=84.6s)]
*  that there's actually a plan in motion not just to obliterate the deep state or cleanse it or whatever he says, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=87.8s)]
*  it's to actually expand presidential power. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Now, again, you're an historian. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=97.6s)]
*  You've seen that when we move from democracy to autocracy around the world and throughout history, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  this is part of the playbook. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah. In fact, the essence of authoritarianism is the executive branch [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=107.6s)]
*  that becomes so powerful that it overwhelms the judiciary representation and takes away independence. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=112.2s)]
*  So I looked at that reporting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=119.2s)]
*  It was quite chilling to hear Trump's former director of the Office of Management and Budget say, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  we're looking for pockets of independence to seize them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=128.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=132.2s)]
*  So what he's saying is that they're going to obliterate the idea of independent institutions, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=133.2s)]
*  of neutrality, of institutions and agencies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=140.6s)]
*  And using the word seize is very interesting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=145.2s)]
*  That's not the language of democratic reform. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  That's the language of autocratic takeover. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=150.4s)]
*  Independence. I mean, we celebrate Independence Day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=153.6s)]
*  It's one of our biggest things. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=156.0s)]
*  The concept of independence in government, the concept of the independence of our branches of government. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=157.2s)]
*  This has now become the kind of thing that Donald Trump says, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  we can't have too much of this. We can't have this independence running around. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=167.6s)]
*  We need my view of the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=170.2s)]
*  At some point, why does this not stop in its tracks with those people who are at his rally saying, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  but that's not what I want. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=178.2s)]
*  I don't want you to trample over independence in America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is very different than other politicians. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=183.2s)]
*  He's a cult leader. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  And he set up this narrative, both the narrative of his victimhood, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  that he's the victim of the deep state and that he's actually protecting them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=193.2s)]
*  So he set that up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=197.6s)]
*  He's also set up for many years that the judiciary, the Department of Justice, the press, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=199.0s)]
*  all of these people are partisan and out to get him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=204.8s)]
*  And so they everything that happens every time he's targeted, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=208.6s)]
*  they believe this is a kind of this how conspiracy theory works. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=213.8s)]
*  They believe it's a fulfillment of what they were their worst fears. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=217.8s)]
*  And that's why they're not going anywhere. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=222.6s)]
*  And that's why with each indictment, his popularity either stays the same or rises. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=224.6s)]
*  Right. And what we've seen is whenever it gets prosecuted and he doesn't like it, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=230.6s)]
*  he calls the prosecutors names. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=234.4s)]
*  He calls everybody names. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=236.0s)]
*  It's all a witch hunt. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=237.0s)]
*  And he motivates people against them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=238.0s)]
*  But he didn't do that this weekend. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=240.0s)]
*  He talked about Aileen Cannon, his judge in the Mar-a-Lago case, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=241.4s)]
*  and what a patriot she is and how we need more like her. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  What was that dog whistle all about? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  I see this knowing how authoritarians use public appearances to levy veiled threats. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=251.6s)]
*  This was a reminder to the judge to stay on track. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=259.8s)]
*  And it was a reminder to all other judges that this is what he expects of them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=265.2s)]
*  Because what we're talking about here is a reshaping of government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=269.8s)]
*  So that loyalty is all that matters, not professionalism, not expertise. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=274.4s)]
*  You know, there are people who say, well, yeah, we need more efficient government, smaller government. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=279.8s)]
*  But that's not what Donald Trump's saying here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, he said he's going to be purging the sick political class that hates our nation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=287.0s)]
*  He's telling us that political attributes are going to be what decides who survives and who has to leave. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=292.8s)]
*  And that's authoritarianism. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's important to note for conservatives, it's not about small government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=302.6s)]
*  He's not talking about the size of government. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=305.6s)]
*  He's talking about controlling the various aspects and levers of government. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=307.4s)]
*  Yes. And the end game of all of this is survival of Donald Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=311.0s)]
*  And, you know, authoritarians are not like other leaders. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=316.0s)]
*  Most people would not want to run for office if they're under investigation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=319.2s)]
*  Well, that's not how these guys roll, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=323.0s)]
*  Putin, Trump, Netanyahu, Berlusconi, they all run for office. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=325.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  The goal is to get to power and do autocratic capture of the judiciary, especially, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  so that you can become untouchable, so that you never have to worry about an indictment and investigation again because you control the government. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=336.2s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=345.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the trial gets delayed or the trial takes too long [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=346.4s)]
*  or that Donald Trump gets elected before the end of the trial or that the trial doesn't happen. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump, you couldn't prosecute when he was president. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=357.0s)]
*  Now he doesn't want you to prosecute him because he's busy running for president. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=359.4s)]
*  Then he won't be prosecutable again because he's president again. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=362.8s)]
*  At some point, this could become very dangerous. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=366.0s)]
*  America in 2025 could be an entirely different place than it is today. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=368.8s)]
*  It is, and I think Americans have to... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=372.8s)]
*  You know, it's very hard because it's always different in every case. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=375.6s)]
*  However, in my book Strongmen, which is 100 years of people going through this, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=379.8s)]
*  nobody's ever prepared and they think they're going to be the exception. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=385.0s)]
*  And they don't listen to the warning signs until it's too late, which is why you and I talk so much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=389.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=393.8s)]
*  These are the warning signs. We're yelling them from the rooftops. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=395.4s)]
*  Yes, he's being very clear. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=399.0s)]
*  And one of my maxims from studying this stuff is that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=401.0s)]
*  authoritarians always tell you what they're going to do as a kind of challenge and as a warning. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=404.2s)]
*  And people don't listen until it's too late. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=411.0s)]
*  There's no particular benefit to thinking that when he becomes president, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  this will all not happen because we spent four years thinking once he's president, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=416.8s)]
*  he'll become more presidential. He's basically telling you what he's going to do. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=420.2s)]
*  He will be finishing the job that he started. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=423.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's not just destroying democracy internally. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=425.6s)]
*  That is also... Donald Trump always had two aims. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=430.8s)]
*  One was domestic. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=434.6s)]
*  The other was to take America out of the realm of democratic internationalism and align it with autocracies. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=436.0s)]
*  And that will happen as well. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=444.2s)]
*  All right. Well, if that happens, Ruth Ben-Ghien, I will continue our conversations. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=446.0s)]
*  We will join you from Canada. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=448.6s)]
*  Thanks, Ruth. Good to see you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmEnuNkCTo&t=450.6s)]
