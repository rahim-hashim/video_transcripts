# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=0.0s)]
*  Who is prosecuting Donald Trump and 18 other criminal under racketeering charges? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=4.78s)]
*  Announced her office is investigating threats against grand jurors who indicted the ex-president [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  NBC News reporters Blaine Alexander and Ryan Reilly first reported yesterday that Trump supporters leaked the reported addresses of grand jurors [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=17.46s)]
*  Online along with their names which did appear in the indictment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=25.48s)]
*  And this is just the latest example of threatening behavior by Trump supporters directed at the various people working to hold them accountable [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  For the crimes he is accused of we also learned yesterday [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=35.72s)]
*  But a Texas woman was arrested and charged with making threats towards judge Tonya Chutkin who is overseeing Donald Trump's federal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  January 6 trial [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=47.64s)]
*  according to the criminal complaint [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=49.44s)]
*  Abigail Joe Shry left a threatening voicemail intended for Chutkin where she refers the judge with a racial slur [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=51.32s)]
*  And apparently said quote if Trump doesn't get elected in 2024 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=58.42s)]
*  We are coming to kill you so tread lightly before using another slur [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=62.28s)]
*  she also targeted a Texas Democratic Congresswoman and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Vocal Trump critic saying quote we want to kill Sheila Jackson Lee now in police question try [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=71.36s)]
*  They showed up at her door to talk to her she quote stated she had no plans to travel to Washington DC or Houston [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=77.78s)]
*  To carry out anything she stated adding that if Sheila Jackson Lee comes to Shry's hometown, then we need to worry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=83.3s)]
*  Get that this woman visited by the FBI threatened congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee again to them to law enforcement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=91.34s)]
*  Couldn't help herself [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=98.9s)]
*  And we learned about all that in just the past two days two days [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=100.58s)]
*  Now if you go back last week [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=104.74s)]
*  There is of course the case the armed Utah man who was killed by federal agents after he made very [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=106.1s)]
*  Specific threats of violence against President Biden as well as district attorney Alvin Bragg who he threatened to shoot [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=110.69999999999999s)]
*  Bragg of course is the one prosecuting Trump in the Manhattan hush money case. I [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=117.46s)]
*  Could spend the entire hour listing threats made by Trump supporters against the ex-presidents perceived enemies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=122.14s)]
*  Fonny Willis says she has been on the receiving end of racist threats as well and we can all see what's happening here [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=133.88s)]
*  Threats happen in public life and they they're not contained to one part of the ideological spectrum want to be clear about that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  But what's happening here is? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=140.76s)]
*  Part of a larger story part of a long history of menace and violence as a form of political power [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=143.2s)]
*  Wielded by Donald Trump and the MAGA, right? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=148.96s)]
*  These are not just isolated incidents. This is coming from the top down [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=152.2s)]
*  Donald Trump knows exactly what he's doing when he goes on social media and he shares a picture of judge cut [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=155.96s)]
*  Chutkin with a post calling her an activist judge accusing her of running election interference [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=161.72s)]
*  Just today Trump's campaign released this video attacking special counsel Jack Smith for subpoenaing access to his Twitter account [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=167.64s)]
*  How dare lowlife prosecutor deranged Jack Smith, that's right. He's deranged [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=176.44s)]
*  Break into my former Twitter account without informing me and indeed trying to completely hide this atrocity from me [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=182.16s)]
*  It's very obvious what Donald Trump is doing right what he's trying to cultivate a sense of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=190.24s)]
*  menace and the possibility of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=194.56s)]
*  reprisal retribution violence from the most diehard supporters [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=198.12s)]
*  When he calls the prosecutors charging him to range when he accuses him of committing an atrocity [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=202.04s)]
*  I mean at the very least and this is me bending over backwards to be charitable [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=206.2s)]
*  Let's say that Trump certainly appears to be unbothered [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=211.16s)]
*  When his supporters make good on the implicit requests in his inflammatory language [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=214.32s)]
*  And I want to be really absolutely clear here because I think a lot of this stuff gets memory hold right in the flow of the news [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=220.2s)]
*  we're not talking about hypotheticals or thought experiments or abstractions a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=226.4s)]
*  Few months ago a deranged QAnon supporter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=231.64s)]
*  bashed in the head of Nancy Pelosi's elderly husband with a hammer after breaking into her house and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=234.68s)]
*  Describing how he was there looking for the speaker who he wanted to torture in her own home [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=240.76s)]
*  That man after that break-in was then excused and defended outright lied about by [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=245.56s)]
*  Nearly everyone in the political right from Elon Musk to Donald Trump himself [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=252.76s)]
*  In the run-up to 2018 midterms another thing that's been memory-hold you remember there was a guy with a Trump-themed van [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=258.44s)]
*  Who mailed actual pipe bombs they didn't go off, but they were real pipe bombs to prominent Trump critics in government and the media [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=264.08s)]
*  There was also the yet as yet uncaught pipe bomber another thing that's been memory-hold remember that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=270.68s)]
*  The early hours of January 6 who wanted to tried to again with actual bombs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=276.8s)]
*  Blow up the DNC and the RNC the night before January 6th [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course there was January 6 itself when Trump supporters made good on the promise of violent political force [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=286.68s)]
*  Storming the Capitol in an attempt to overthrow the US government some insurrection even constructed a gallows [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  Some insurrectionists even constructed a gallows some chanted they want to hang Mike Pence reportedly Trump used that might not be such a bad idea [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=297.76s)]
*  Because this is who Donald Trump has always been his obvious personal cowardice aside [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=308.04s)]
*  he's a guy who thinks political violence is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=314.0s)]
*  acceptable means to an end a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=317.28s)]
*  desirable one in some cases [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=320.12s)]
*  Don't forget he spent his entire first presidential campaign encouraging attendees at his rallies to assault protesters I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=322.16s)]
*  Got a little notice in case you see the security guys. We have wonderful security guys. They said mr. Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=329.16s)]
*  There may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=335.0s)]
*  So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato knock the crap out of them would you seriously? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=339.08s)]
*  Okay, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=345.8s)]
*  So when Trump posts to social media the picture of judge Chuck and when he posts videos like the one we played for you a moment [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=353.08s)]
*  ago [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=358.36s)]
*  Let's call it what it is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=359.2s)]
*  He is obviously fomenting violence against the judges and prosecutors. I mean if something terrible happens [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=361.4s)]
*  What are we going to conclude? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=369.12s)]
*  Every warning sign is blinking bright red and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  Of course, yes most Trump supporters the vast majority are not violent. They're not gonna do something violent and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=376.36s)]
*  Even among those who make threats, you know, the the Shry woman for example, I don't know most [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=382.04s)]
*  Probably are not serious again the vast majority, but this is kind of a numbers game here [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=388.6s)]
*  It's a big country. So some small percentage of them are [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=394.6s)]
*  We know that to be true again. This is not an abstraction the longer Trump keeps inciting and agitating [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=399.68s)]
*  It's a roll the dice each time and the greater the odds [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=406.96s)]
*  iteratively are that that small group of people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  Who could do something will do something? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=414.88s)]
*  It only has to be a few [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is utilizing that reality [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=421.12s)]
*  To increase the cost of prosecuting him to increase the cost of crossing him in the same way a mafia boss would [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=423.88s)]
*  He has been explicit [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=431.24s)]
*  He posted himself quote if you go after me I'm coming after you I [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=433.16s)]
*  Am NOT a lawyer I do not claim to know what counts as actionable speech in a legal sense [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  Furthermore the First Amendment in the United States is broad for a reason and as a journalist. I like it that way [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  Put that aside morally though morally [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=451.56s)]
*  We all know what's happening and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=455.72s)]
*  We all know who's culpable for what's already happened and what may be to come mark my words [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=458.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you a picture and some of the people in it you will recognize and some you will not so right there [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  In the center of this picture that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas you probably recognize him [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=472.68s)]
*  Over there on the left is a podcaster and Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. You probably recognize him and if you're thinking well [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  That looks like a really nice room. You're right. That's the library that belongs to billionaire Harlan Crowe [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=486.62s)]
*  Crowe of course is the guy who paid the private boarding school tuition for Clarence Thomas's grandnephew [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=493.7s)]
*  Also the guy who bought the house where Thomas's mother lives rent-free. He's the guy that's taken Thomas on all sorts of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=499.1s)]
*  incredibly luxurious trips [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=506.3s)]
*  And his library was used for the occasion to swear in this guy someone you probably don't know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=508.5s)]
*  His name is James Ho and he is being sworn into the federal judiciary by Justice Clarence Thomas in 2018 [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=514.16s)]
*  After being nominated by Donald Trump [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=521.5999999999999s)]
*  Ho is a right-wing lawyer federalist society made man [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=523.8s)]
*  if you will who got a lifetime judicial appointment to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=526.8399999999999s)]
*  He's in the news now because of well a just excruciating [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=532.16s)]
*  Opinion that he wrote about the abortion pill methampristone. So it started yesterday [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=536.4s)]
*  That's when that Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is probably the most right-wing appellate court in the country [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=541.12s)]
*  Upheld parts of an opinion by another right-wing judge in Texas [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=547.24s)]
*  Remember the guy in Amarillo who tried to single-handedly take the abortion pill off all shelves [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=551.0s)]
*  nationwide everywhere through judicial fiat [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=558.04s)]
*  Now this case that has been working its way through the federal judiciary [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=561.78s)]
*  One of the challenges for this lawsuit is that the plaintiffs who are suing right to get the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=565.96s)]
*  Drug taken off the shelves. There are a bunch of anti-abortion doctors basically and for them to have standing in federal court [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=572.84s)]
*  Right to even get to an analysis the merits of the case. They got to show that they have an injury [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  Like what what is the injury? What injury does a doctor have? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  If a patient somewhere takes this abortion pill or if the abortion pills accessible broadly [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=590.48s)]
*  It's good question. Well in an opinion written by Judge James ho that guy who's in the Harlan Crowe library with Clarence [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  Thomas and Ted Cruz [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=604.84s)]
*  That guy took a really bonkers position [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=606.92s)]
*  Writing in his opinion that the plaintiffs. These are the anti-abortion doctors experience [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=611.96s)]
*  Aesthetic injury [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=617.8s)]
*  That's the grounds for standing. I'm not making this up. I didn't pull this out of there. I'm gonna quote it here quote [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=619.88s)]
*  Unborn babies, you know what his politics are from that unborn babies [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgcLStp0VE&t=625.0s)]
