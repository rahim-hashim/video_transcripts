# All In with Chris Hayes - Dec. 20  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=0.0s)]
*  Whether the 14th Amendment applies or not, the court will make that decision. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=3.64s)]
*  But he certainly supported an insurrection. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=7.2s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=10.24s)]
*  None. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=11.8s)]
*  Zero. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=12.8s)]
*  The fallout from Colorado's seismic decision to boot Donald Trump off the primary ballot. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=13.8s)]
*  Trump incited the insurrection, and there is no loophole in the Constitution. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=19.44s)]
*  Tonight, the dilemma for conservatives on the Supreme Court. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=24.6s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer, but I suspect the Supreme Court will likely overturn this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=29.08s)]
*  And the Republicans cramble to keep Trump on the ballot regardless. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=33.64s)]
*  And if need be, we're going to withdraw from the primary and go to a strict caucus process [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=37.08s)]
*  that would allow our voters to choose Donald Trump if they want. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Plus the other states who could follow Colorado's lead. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=46.76s)]
*  Trump's attempt to stall the special prosecutor at the Supreme Court and the ramifications [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  of all of this for the 2024 election. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  We don't need to have judges making these decisions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=58.48s)]
*  We need voters to have to make these decisions. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=60.96s)]
*  What All In starts right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=63.76s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=70.36s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=71.16s)]
*  Colorado Republicans are publicly threatening to change how they vote for presidential [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=71.84s)]
*  nominees in light of yesterday's decision by the state Supreme Court in Colorado to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=76.52s)]
*  bar Trump from the primary ballot under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=80.92s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=85.2s)]
*  The state GOP now saying it may begin the legally fraught process of switching from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=86.2s)]
*  a primary to a caucus in order to allow its members to still cast their votes for Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=90.92s)]
*  next March. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=95.48s)]
*  As of now, that mostly just seems like posturing, to be honest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=96.48s)]
*  But for all of the controversy, when you go back to the relevant text used to raise the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=100.56s)]
*  challenge, Section 3, the 14th Amendment, it really does stand out as pretty darn fitting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=104.56s)]
*  Quote, no person shall hold any office under the United States who, having previously taken [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=111.48s)]
*  an oath as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution, shall have engaged [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=117.4s)]
*  in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=122.04s)]
*  You cannot hold government office if you are an insurrectionist or you supported insurrectionists. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=128.96s)]
*  It's quite clear, quite simple, especially when you consider the amendment within the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=134.04s)]
*  historical context of its ratification. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=139.16s)]
*  But this decision from the Colorado Supreme Court yesterday still came as a shock, surprise. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=142.92s)]
*  And that's largely, I think, because of the ways in which American legal culture has grown [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  to emphasize, even fetishize, some parts of the Constitution and its founding while largely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=154.76s)]
*  ignoring others. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=160.12s)]
*  Around the 1980s, the American right embraced the judicial philosophy of originalism, thanks [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=161.96s)]
*  in large part to late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=166.72s)]
*  Basically, it's the idea that we should interpret the Constitution only as its founders intended [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=170.48s)]
*  and as people understood it at the time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=176.92s)]
*  To be clear, this was always a reactionary project, often undertaken in transparently [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=180.28s)]
*  bad faith, used to reverse engineer the right's preferred political outcomes, and discarded [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=184.96s)]
*  when it didn't fit their agenda. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=189.64s)]
*  But originalism remains a de facto legal theory of the American conservative movement and, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=192.2s)]
*  honestly, the 6-3 Trump Court. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  And it remains enormously effective as a rhetorical tool because it taps into our shared civic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=199.24s)]
*  religion of reverence for our founders. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  With that in mind, then, I think it's worth looking at the history of the Reconstruction [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Amendments, which were ratified with the hope of refounding the country after the Civil War [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=212.0s)]
*  without the stain of slavery following the horrible carnage of that war. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  When it was over, 600,000 men have perished. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=222.4s)]
*  But the Union held, and the Constitution, like the nation, was reborn. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=226.08s)]
*  The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments together, but above all the 14th Amendment, is the fruit [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=232.4s)]
*  of the Civil War. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=239.4s)]
*  It is what all those brave men fought for and died for. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=240.4s)]
*  This is from a PBS documentary about the war. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=246.0s)]
*  These Amendments, particularly the 14th Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection, completely [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=248.52s)]
*  and utterly transformed the structure of American government. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Legal ramifications of the 14th Amendment gave rise to everything we think of as the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=256.72s)]
*  modern state and pluralistic, multiracial democracy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=259.72s)]
*  It is impossible to overstate just how important it is to our current understanding of what [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  America is and of constitutional law. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  And yet, its founding, the second founding of the country, the founding amendments after [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=270.52s)]
*  the war, the Reconstruction Amendments, is basically lost to history. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=275.82s)]
*  Its drafters are not household names like the men who drafted the Bill of Rights. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=280.14s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=284.26s)]
*  Those men were political radicals. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=286.06s)]
*  The people who drafted the Reconstruction Amendments were the vanguard of radicalism, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=288.58s)]
*  in fact, who, after defeating the traitorous, insurrectionist slave power of the South, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=292.34s)]
*  forced them at gunpoint into a participatory, multiracial democracy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=297.82s)]
*  Over the past 150 years, there has been an effort not to reckon with that uncompromising [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=303.82s)]
*  fact. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=309.06s)]
*  That said, if we're going to take an originalist perspective here, that history is pretty important. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=310.06s)]
*  The 14th Amendment was indeed a bold act of raw political power in furtherance of that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=314.82s)]
*  project of multiracial democracy, and it should be interpreted as such. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=320.62s)]
*  The person most responsible for covering that fundamental reality of our country's second [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=325.42s)]
*  founding and the constitutional provisions it created is Supreme Court Justice Katanji [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=329.82s)]
*  Brown Jackson. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=334.46s)]
*  Time and again, she has argued we cannot ignore the radical origins or radical meaning of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=336.74s)]
*  the 14th Amendment, nor its original intention as a protector of marginalized people in the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=341.5s)]
*  face of state oppression. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=345.7s)]
*  This has been especially apparent when she talks about things like affirmative action [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=347.86s)]
*  and voting rights. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=350.86s)]
*  I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution, at what [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=353.1s)]
*  the framers and the founders thought about, and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=359.38s)]
*  it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the 14th [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=366.1s)]
*  Amendment, the 15th Amendment in a race-conscious way. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=372.1s)]
*  The entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=375.26s)]
*  The legislator who introduced that amendment said that, quote, unless the Constitution [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=381.7s)]
*  should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=388.16s)]
*  to death the hated freedmen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  That's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=397.72s)]
*  No, it's sure not. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=402.72s)]
*  And the reason that I'm going on this long preamble of history is because this all brings [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  us back to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=409.72s)]
*  The people that wrote that amendment understood that the insurrectionist self and the people [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  that had led it insurrection were an existential threat to the preserved union. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=417.92s)]
*  That those who took up arms against their own government, who betrayed it, on behalf [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=425.56s)]
*  of slavery, those who remain committed to that cause must be eradicated from the government [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=430.26s)]
*  forever or the union would perish. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=435.36s)]
*  And they were radicals about that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=438.12s)]
*  In fact, the current version of Section 3, that's the compromise version. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=440.0s)]
*  The original, more extreme version of the text would have barred all former Confederates [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=444.28s)]
*  from participating in democracy at all for a number of years. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=447.76s)]
*  One founder of the amendment, radical Republican legend Thaddeus Stevens, said that even that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=451.23999999999995s)]
*  would have been, quote, too lenient. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  So now here we are in 2023, faced with the plain meaning of the text written by these [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=458.76s)]
*  lost and forgotten founders whose vision of the country was a radical vision of multiracial [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=462.88s)]
*  equality for men. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=468.94s)]
*  And this majority in Colorado takes an originalist framework when they argue that Donald Trump, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=471.6s)]
*  the ultimate modern insurrectionist who led an armed mob against the American government, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=475.8s)]
*  must too be never allowed to hold office again, just like his Confederate predecessors. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=480.72s)]
*  Particularly when it comes to defining what exactly constitutes an office of the United [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=485.36s)]
*  States, which was the exact originalist argument the plaintiffs made when they argued in front [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=490.04s)]
*  of the court that Trump should be ineligible. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=495.24s)]
*  Provision tells us over and over that the presidency is an office and that the person [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=499.32s)]
*  who holds it swears an oath of office before assuming the execution of his office. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  And the plain meaning of an officer is just one who holds an office. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=511.56s)]
*  So we think the text here is very clear that the history supports it and certainly that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=516.9s)]
*  the core purpose of the provision supports that reading as well. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=523.08s)]
*  And I have to say, after years of hypocrisy with so-called originalists arguing the First [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=527.28s)]
*  Amendment protects everything from unlimited dark money in our politics, the Second Amendment [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  gives you the right to own military grade weapons detached from the first rather sizable [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  clause in that amendment. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=539.04s)]
*  There is something so satisfying about seeing originalism weaponize a force for good for [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=540.54s)]
*  multiracial democracy and equality. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=545.72s)]
*  The ex-president engaged in insurrection against the United States. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=549.7s)]
*  The Constitution says he is not qualified for office as a result. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=552.34s)]
*  That is the plain truth of the matter and a straightforward reading of the law. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=555.56s)]
*  Now watch all the conservative originalists on the Supreme Court run away from it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for the New York Times and he joins me. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=566.4s)]
*  Now Jamel, you like myself are a reconstruction buff. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=569.5999999999999s)]
*  And I thought of you today as I was sort of working through this argument because I wonder [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  if you think, to me it's not an accident in some ways. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  We've ended up here in this portion of the Constitution with Donald Trump and this question. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=583.16s)]
*  Yeah, that it is it is fortuitous, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=590.56s)]
*  So the the purpose of this amendment, the purpose of the reconstruction amendments really [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=595.12s)]
*  is to in the words of a great book by Mark Graber, punish, treason and reward loyalty. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  And this is in the face of this former slaveocracy, white supremacist movement we call the Confederacy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  And it feels very fitting that we are once again looking at what this provision entails [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  for constitutional government in the face of a political actor whose movement is very [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  much about restoring this idea of the country as belonging to a particular group of people [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=627.12s)]
*  and belonging exclusively to this group of people, to the exclusion of all other people [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=634.64s)]
*  and to the extent that they're willing to undermine constitutional democracy itself [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=639.48s)]
*  to make that vision real. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  And so it's like it's not just that there's a there's this originalist argument for the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=645.76s)]
*  14th Amendment that I think is very straightforward, but that like this is in a lot of ways the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=649.76s)]
*  precise circumstance that the Section 3 was written for. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=653.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was going to ask you, you know, one argument I think I've seen is that, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=658.16s)]
*  well, they were they were thinking specifically about a certain insurrection, a certain rebellion, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=662.36s)]
*  that they were using the term in Section Rebellion, but it was fresh off the Civil War. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=666.44s)]
*  And what they really meant was the following. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=669.96s)]
*  If you participated on the side of the Confederacy, you're disqualified. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=672.6s)]
*  They didn't mean it like going forward forever. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=676.24s)]
*  Which is that, you know, that's not the case. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=681.6400000000001s)]
*  One thing that is precipitating Section 3, which is written right in this 1865, 1866 [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=684.72s)]
*  period, is that there is this real fear that the former Confederates plus Northern [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=691.08s)]
*  Democrats, Southern sympathetic Democrats, plus other actors are going to try to reclaim [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=697.24s)]
*  power and like take power within Congress once again on the sort of almost perverse [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=702.96s)]
*  implications of the 13th Amendment, which frees in the chattel slavery, frees the slaves, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=710.64s)]
*  but also effectively repeals the Three Fists Clause. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=716.6s)]
*  And so in the South, with no three fits clause, all of a sudden these former Confederates [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=719.8s)]
*  could have the representational weight of all of these now free black Americans in the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  Republicans in Congress, the radical Republicans in particular, were terrified of this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=731.68s)]
*  And so they're looking forward. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=736.04s)]
*  They're saying we're trying to prevent something that may happen in the future using this [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  this language. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=742.64s)]
*  And there's there's also something I mean, I'm curious just what you think about the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=744.04s)]
*  decision itself. I mean, you know, again, the history here to me is fascinating. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=748.56s)]
*  I think the straightforward legal case is pretty clear, but it also is a complicated [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=752.5999999999999s)]
*  situation in a sort of unprecedented situation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=758.04s)]
*  Well, what do you think? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=760.76s)]
*  You know, I'm very much inclined to say that the legal reasoning is airtight. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=764.3599999999999s)]
*  It's to me very straightforward what the Constitution demands in this case. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=770.56s)]
*  But the political case for not removing Trump from the ballot is a bit trickier. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=775.48s)]
*  And I think there's a legitimate case to make that it is would be counterproductive to have [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=780.8s)]
*  Trump disqualified in this manner and that the best approach is at the ballot box. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=785.56s)]
*  I also wonder, too, I mean, one of the things I've seen people sort of rebelling at the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=791.36s)]
*  very notion of disqualification, that that itself is anti-democratic. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=795.92s)]
*  And I return again, the reason the service or originalist little preamble here is because [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=800.0s)]
*  their vision of disqualification was precisely for the preservation of multiracial democracy [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=806.72s)]
*  against its foes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=812.48s)]
*  It wasn't dictatorial. It was precisely because those people pose such a threat to the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=813.88s)]
*  multiracial democracy that was in its infancy. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=819.24s)]
*  They were trying to to create amidst tremendous threat, pressure and violence that it is a [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=821.36s)]
*  pro-democratic portion of a pro-democratic amendment. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=827.12s)]
*  That's right. Their fear is that the Southern former confederation once again being [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  Congress or in power in the states and just begin to repeal, excuse me, repeal the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=838.32s)]
*  efforts of the Reconstruction Congress to bring some degree of equality to the South. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  And in the same way, if we were all certain, right, that Donald Trump was going to respect [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  the Constitution, was going to respect liberal democratic values, that I don't think this [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=857.76s)]
*  would be an issue. But obviously, because of January 6, because we know that Trump is [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=863.4000000000001s)]
*  contemptuous of these things and that there is a non-trivial chance that once in office [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=869.2s)]
*  again, Trump will again try to completely undermine constitutional government. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=874.88s)]
*  It sets up the situation where this is not just as simply a case of differing political [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=879.72s)]
*  views, but this is someone who is opposed to the foundation of the system itself. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=883.64s)]
*  And that's where the language of the 14th Amendment comes in and Section 3 comes in. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  All right, Jamal Bowie. Always a pleasure. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=892.6s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Coming up, we dive into details. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=894.4s)]
*  What is the Colorado Supreme Court trying to tell the U.S. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=898.0s)]
*  Supreme Court in its decision? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=900.76s)]
*  That's next. One thing that's quite clear in the Colorado majority opinion is how [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=902.12s)]
*  much the majority is writing for the conservative United States Supreme Court, knowing full [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=910.04s)]
*  well they will almost certainly review it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=914.8s)]
*  This is particularly true around the Supreme Court's terms of originalism, original public [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=917.12s)]
*  meaning, a phrase they use, but also in the bedrock conservative principle that states [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=921.12s)]
*  are the ultimate arbiters of and administrators of elections, even federal elections. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=925.0s)]
*  This has been a stalwart conservative piece of jurisprudence, and it is in that context [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=929.32s)]
*  that the Colorado justices take Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in his own words when [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=933.36s)]
*  he was an appellate court judge and offer them back at him, citing him saying, yes, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=939.12s)]
*  it is, quote, a state's legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=942.84s)]
*  functioning of the political process that permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=947.08s)]
*  who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=952.12s)]
*  This is part of a broader, longstanding tendency among conservatives of asserting that [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=955.6s)]
*  states' rights devolve things to the states, even though that is often and has been [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  historically to the great detriment of all kinds of voters of color and all sorts of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=964.16s)]
*  other populations. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=967.76s)]
*  Now, that exact same principle is going to come before a Supreme Court that is likely [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=969.28s)]
*  going to find historic and perhaps comical ways to bend itself around to the other view. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=974.0s)]
*  Everyone anticipates they're going to take this case. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=978.52s)]
*  Most people think they will overturn it, but there's almost a schadenfreude interest in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=980.8s)]
*  exactly how they're going to do it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=985.32s)]
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at New York University School of Law, co-host of Strict [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=987.32s)]
*  Scrutiny podcast, along with Leah Lippman and my wife, Kate Shaw, Jeffrey Tubman, an [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=990.8s)]
*  attorney and legal analyst, and they both join me now. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=994.48s)]
*  So I don't think there's much suspense like, will they take it? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=996.96s)]
*  They're going to take it, though it would be hilarious if they didn't. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=998.84s)]
*  I also don't think there's a ton of suspense about are they going to let this stand? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1004.6s)]
*  The interesting question is like, how are they going to get there? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1006.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1009.36s)]
*  So, again, we saw that the Colorado majority cited Justice Gorsuch liberally from this [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1010.52s)]
*  10th Circuit decision when he was a judge. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  And this was what the kids on Twitter call this you moment. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1017.88s)]
*  So are these your commitments? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1021.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a court that has been very clear about their commitments to textualism, their [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  commitments to strict interpretation, their commitments to this idea of federalism, that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1029.2s)]
*  there are certain things that are state prerogatives and are for the states to decide, including [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  election law. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1037.28s)]
*  And all of this is going to be tested in this case, because there's also this outstanding [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1038.28s)]
*  practical concern that if they allow this decision to stand, whether it's because of [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1043.36s)]
*  textualism, federalism or whatnot, it means that there's going to be a patchwork quilt of [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1047.04s)]
*  disqualifications all around this country, patchwork ballots. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1052.24s)]
*  And this election will probably not seem super legitimate to the people that it needs to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1055.56s)]
*  seem legitimate to. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1061.28s)]
*  And that's a real concern. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1062.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's not unlike the kind of practicality concerns that guided the court in Bush versus [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1063.6s)]
*  Gore back in 2000. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1067.8s)]
*  Bush versus Gore. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1070.16s)]
*  Talk about states, right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1071.6s)]
*  It is Bush versus Gore. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1072.68s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1074.04s)]
*  I mean, you know, what it means to be a conservative is to believe that states get to regulate [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1074.64s)]
*  their own affairs. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1080.56s)]
*  Especially when it comes to elections. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1081.72s)]
*  And this is at issue, a state statute in Colorado about the election. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  Just as in Florida, it was Florida law saying under Florida law, you Al Gore are entitled [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1087.96s)]
*  to a recount. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1094.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court in Bush v. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1095.8s)]
*  Gore said, no, no, no, this would be unfair to George W. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1097.52s)]
*  Bush. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1100.12s)]
*  It would violate his rights. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1100.48s)]
*  Thus, George Bush is president. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1101.76s)]
*  So, you know, these these principles yield to results that the majority wants to. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1103.1599999999999s)]
*  And I expect that's what would happen. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say, just to add to that, not only did they say no, no, no, it would [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1110.24s)]
*  violate its rights. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1113.84s)]
*  It would violate their rights under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1114.6s)]
*  which we have now found a novel interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that this [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1119.08s)]
*  violates, though it's only good, said novel interpretation, for this decision and no [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1123.6799999999998s)]
*  more. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1128.96s)]
*  This ticket for this train only. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1129.1599999999999s)]
*  That's that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1130.76s)]
*  That was that was the heart of Bush v. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1131.24s)]
*  Gore. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1133.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1133.6799999999998s)]
*  So I agree with everything that Jeff has said. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1133.72s)]
*  I think one thing is different is that this is a very different court than the one in [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  Bush versus Gore. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1138.6799999999998s)]
*  This is a court whose legitimacy has been called into question numerous times over the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1139.44s)]
*  last three years. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1144.52s)]
*  This is not the court that was in 2000. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1145.76s)]
*  And I think that has to weigh on them as well. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1148.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know that it will necessarily lead to a different outcome, but it may shape the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1150.3600000000001s)]
*  way they get to that outcome. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1153.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, and I also don't want to be I don't want to be over like it is a set of novel [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  issues. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1158.8400000000001s)]
*  Like I may say that in the majority opinion. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1159.24s)]
*  I think they're quite clear about that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1160.76s)]
*  The big question of like, yes, the plain language is clear, but like what counts as [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1162.16s)]
*  insurrection and more, I think precisely who gets to say who is the arbiter of whether [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1166.6799999999998s)]
*  an individual counts here? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1172.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, and that's that's where I think there is room for the Supreme Court to get rid of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1174.1999999999998s)]
*  this case in a way that is intellectually respectable, which is that's interesting, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1179.08s)]
*  which is you don't that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1184.12s)]
*  Yes, it is true. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1187.08s)]
*  A president a presidential candidate can be disqualified for supporting and engaging in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1188.12s)]
*  insurrection, but Donald Trump was not given adequate due process. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1194.52s)]
*  He was not given adequate opportunity to prove that he did that he did not engage in it, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1198.36s)]
*  that there was the trial was too attenuate. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1204.52s)]
*  It was was too brief. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1206.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1208.28s)]
*  He wasn't allowed to subpoena witnesses. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1208.36s)]
*  He wasn't allowed to take depositions. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1209.96s)]
*  That's one way of getting rid of the case, overturning it without too much embarrassing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1211.96s)]
*  themselves. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1217.4s)]
*  And the dissenters in Colorado sort of laid the seeds for that when they talked about [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  the idea that they were very reluctant to disqualify someone in the absence of a criminal [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1222.04s)]
*  conviction for insurrection. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1227.08s)]
*  And so the seeds of this are already in the water. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1228.84s)]
*  So one thing that's very interesting about that, and I also I agree, I think there's [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1232.28s)]
*  there's a way out for them to not be as quite sort of like obvious as Bush v Gore, the sort [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1236.44s)]
*  of where they had they were sort of their backs were up against the wall. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1240.44s)]
*  They were just like, screw it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1244.44s)]
*  I mean, they were they. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1245.24s)]
*  But but in this case, I mean, what's interesting is, OK, I think that's a colorable argument, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1246.28s)]
*  right, that this is a serious thing to disqualify from the ballot. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1251.16s)]
*  You need the constitutional requires level of process akin to a criminal conviction. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1253.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1258.1200000000001s)]
*  What's interesting about that is like, OK, well, he might get a criminal conviction [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1258.76s)]
*  for a crime that isn't explicitly named as insurrection, but is essentially that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it's like, wow, that becomes a fresh constitutional issue. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1269.0s)]
*  And well, that's why this issue is necessarily over. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1272.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1274.68s)]
*  Is that if if he gets convicted in one of these cases, particularly the Washington case, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  which is the one likely to go to trial first, assuming the Supreme Court lets it go to go to [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1280.68s)]
*  trial, if he's convicted again, you if he's convicted for a first time, then you will see [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1285.4s)]
*  other states come back to this issue. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1292.04s)]
*  And then he will there will be an even better argument, right, because he will have got due [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1294.28s)]
*  process. You know, what's more a due process, right, than a criminal trial? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1298.92s)]
*  Basically, the highest bar we have. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1303.48s)]
*  So it's not this issue. Even if this Colorado decision is overturned at this point, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1304.68s)]
*  it doesn't mean it's over for 2024. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1311.56s)]
*  Well, so I think that may be the way that the court will proceed, like reverse on the Colorado [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1314.04s)]
*  Supreme Court decision, but then allow the claim allow the trials to go forward that there is no [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1319.0s)]
*  presidential immunity for these criminal indictments. But it is worth noting that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1324.44s)]
*  Jack Smith had the opportunity to specifically charge Donald Trump with insurrection and did not. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1328.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1333.08s)]
*  And so instead, it's this obstruction of a congressional hearing. And that may also [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1333.4s)]
*  be chum in the water, because there's this Fisher versus United States case where the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1339.4s)]
*  court has to decide whether the meaning of the statute about obstructing governmental [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1342.92s)]
*  proceedings is meant to apply to something like this or simply something that is meant to apply [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1347.64s)]
*  to Enron, which is the origins of that statute in the first place. So there's a lot more that's [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1351.8000000000002s)]
*  going to happen here. But the court may try to split this baby. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1356.44s)]
*  There's also I mean, I guess there's also a question of a timeline here, right? I mean, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1360.1200000000001s)]
*  the timeline is sort of of the utmost importance in the immunity claims that are there working [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  their way out. We're going to talk about that a little more later. But there's also, I mean, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1368.6s)]
*  there's a clock ticking here, right? You got to get people on the ballot. There's going to be a [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1372.6s)]
*  primary. I mean, I guess my question to you is one of the things we know about the court is it moves [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1376.12s)]
*  as fast as it wants to. Right. So what do you expect here? Well, I think they will move quickly [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1380.28s)]
*  on this one. And they won't care particularly that the due process they demand will take too long. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1386.6799999999998s)]
*  They just want to get this case out of the way and just let this people, let the people of Colorado [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1393.24s)]
*  vote for who they want to. And we're sort of doing a little mockery of the court. There is a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1399.24s)]
*  principle here that is troubling that where you don't allow the Republican Party to pick the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1405.24s)]
*  candidate of their choice. And yes, it is true. This provision of the Constitution considers that. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1412.6s)]
*  But you better be damn sure before you start kicking people off ballots. I mean, I agree with [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1419.72s)]
*  that. The only thing I'll say in response to that is because I've seen a lot of people saying that [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1423.72s)]
*  and I don't think it's like at all an illegitimate argument. It's just that like, I guess my feeling [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1427.4s)]
*  is like the Constitution explicitly contemplates disqualification in a few different places. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1431.16s)]
*  And so there is some category of political behavior, specifically political behavior, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  supporting an insurrection in the case of an impeachment, right? With conviction that says [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1440.84s)]
*  like, yeah, this person is rendered outside, like they just can't stand for office again. I think [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1444.68s)]
*  that notion that that category even exists is a little offensive to us. But if it ever existed [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1449.08s)]
*  for a person, I just sort of feel like, yes, I get it. Like it should be a high bar. But if there's [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1455.1599999999999s)]
*  anyone who's going to get up over the bar, Melissa, I feel like he's a pretty good candidate. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1459.8s)]
*  I mean, yes. No argument there. But again, I think there is this question of will this lead [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1463.8799999999999s)]
*  to even more instability? I mean, this is a court that I think is concerned about practicalities. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1471.72s)]
*  And we've seen the court be concerned about practicalities, especially in the context of an [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1476.6s)]
*  election before. And I think that has to concern them, not the least of which their own legitimacy, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1479.8s)]
*  but the legitimacy of this election and having this election pass the smell test for at least [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1485.48s)]
*  50% of the country who thinks Donald Trump should be on the ballot. Yeah. I just want to read this [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1491.08s)]
*  last line by Jesse Wegman, editorial board member of the Times. He said this, he said, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  it's easy to say Mr. Trump's ultimate rejection should come at the hands of the voters, not the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1498.6799999999998s)]
*  courts. I agree with that. The obvious rejoiners and outright majority voters already rejected [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1501.7199999999998s)]
*  the guy in 2020. And we know how that turned out. Brutal violence, several deaths. And during [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1505.8s)]
*  the midst of a stolen election, why should we expect it to be different the next time? That's [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1510.6s)]
*  the other thing that hangs over this. The final thing I'll say and ask you, Jeff, is there's also [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1514.28s)]
*  a threat of violence towards the judges, the justices on the state Supreme Court and the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1519.08s)]
*  SCOTUS justices. Like they signed that majority opinion per curiam anonymously, essentially. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1523.72s)]
*  You can look up their names, but that's a real concern as well. There is violence hovering. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1528.68s)]
*  There was just an arrest in Arizona that didn't get much publicity recently about someone [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1534.5200000000002s)]
*  threatening to kill all sorts of federal officials. Violence hangs over this. January 6 [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1539.72s)]
*  is an aggressive prosecution that has taken place. But right-wing violence in this country [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1548.68s)]
*  is continuing. And the FBI director has spoken about how difficult it is to stop it. And it [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1553.96s)]
*  hasn't gone away. Melissa Murray, Jeffrey Tubman, great to have you both here at the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1561.24s)]
*  table. Appreciate it. Still to come, what if it works? What are the far-reaching ramifications [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1564.28s)]
*  that Melissa just spoke of if Donald Trump really does get kicked off a bunch of ballots? That's next. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1569.88s)]
*  So everybody's assuming at this moment the Supreme Court will overturn the Colorado decision to keep [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1581.32s)]
*  Donald Trump off the ballot. It's not necessarily a given. One prominent appellate lawyer, Rafi [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1585.88s)]
*  Melkonian, joked on social media about how the high court could instead very easily open a legal [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1591.96s)]
*  and political Pandora's box. He said, quote, just deny certain be legends. What that means is the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1597.0s)]
*  Supreme Court could do what they have done with so many cases, what they do with most cases, just [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1603.0s)]
*  nothing. Refused to take it. Let the Colorado court ruling stand. You guys figure it out. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1606.68s)]
*  That would just leave it up to individual states to decide whether the ex-president is legally [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1611.96s)]
*  disqualified from the ballots. And that would be a truly legendary decision because what would [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1615.64s)]
*  flow from it would almost certainly be a crazy and unprecedented legal patchwork. Right now, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  there are at least 16 states with cases pending that challenge Trump's eligibility for office under [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1625.5600000000002s)]
*  section three of the 14th amendment. That is according to Lawfare Blog's section three Trump [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1630.68s)]
*  disqualification track. Thank you for that, Lawfare. They include Alaska, Arizona, Maine, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1635.0s)]
*  Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1639.8000000000002s)]
*  Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Altogether, they represent 176 electoral votes. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1644.6s)]
*  Now, I don't think the challenges would succeed in all those states. In fact, in some of them, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1650.12s)]
*  they've already failed. They're just pending appeal. But what Colorado has shown is that there [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1653.9599999999998s)]
*  really is a strong plain text constitutional case here. It's not frivolous. It's real. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1658.84s)]
*  And at least a few of these states could see successful challenge. What exactly would it [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1663.9599999999998s)]
*  look like to have Donald Trump kicked off the ballot in four or five states before we're about [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1667.9599999999998s)]
*  to run a national election? Would that ultimately good for the country and, most importantly, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1672.44s)]
*  support the forces fighting for American democracy? We'll talk about that next. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1677.48s)]
*  If the leading Democratic presidential nominee just got kicked off the ballot in a key battleground [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1685.56s)]
*  state, the entirety of the discourse the next day would be Democrats freaking out and hand-wringing [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1689.72s)]
*  about what to do. That's not the case in the Republican Party. Donald Trump gets kicked off [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1694.1200000000001s)]
*  the ballot in Colorado, and the consensus among his party challengers seems to be that it helps [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1698.6s)]
*  him with Republican primary voters, that it's a gift. But what if it is not just one state that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1703.1599999999999s)]
*  ultimately declares Trump ineligible? What if it becomes three or four or 16? I don't know. Maybe. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1708.1999999999998s)]
*  Thinking out loud here. Maybe they shouldn't nominate this guy. Amanda Carpenter is a writer [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1713.48s)]
*  and editor at Project Democracy, who previously served as Republican Communications Director on [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1718.12s)]
*  Capitol Hill. Michael Steele is the former chair of the RNC, and they join me now. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1721.9599999999998s)]
*  We sort of hashed through the legal arguments here, which I think are interesting, but [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1727.1599999999999s)]
*  the biggest thing that I've seen people arguing about is the political ramifications. What is [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1731.9599999999998s)]
*  this due to the country? What is it due to politics? What is it due to legitimacy? Amanda, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1739.08s)]
*  what is your impression? Well, my impression is that we're going to have more questions than [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1742.6799999999998s)]
*  just this case more broadly about the rule of law. I mean, the reason we are here is not because [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1750.04s)]
*  Americans say, oh, we have kings in our country. We're OK with dictatorship. Donald Trump can do [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1755.88s)]
*  whatever we want. Right. That is not what has happened at all. The only people failing to hold [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1760.44s)]
*  Donald Trump accountable so far are members of the elite in the Republican Party, either through the [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1766.0400000000002s)]
*  impeachment process or the unfolding Republican primary process. The American people rejected [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1770.7600000000002s)]
*  him as reelecting him as president in 2020. But put that aside, now we are testing questions of legal [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1776.1200000000001s)]
*  accountability. And people absolutely have a right to ask the question, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1782.76s)]
*  courts, hey, does the 14th Amendment mean actually what it says? Could the courts decide? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1787.8799999999999s)]
*  So the only thing we should really be worried about in terms of the politics is, are we going [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1792.52s)]
*  to resolve these questions questions quickly before the election so that Americans can have [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1797.08s)]
*  full knowledge whether Trump did was involved in an insurrection and should be disqualified from [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1801.8s)]
*  office. But more broadly, I think the more important question legally is being posed right [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1808.28s)]
*  now by Jack Smith and whether Donald Trump as a president is immune from the law or not. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1813.0800000000002s)]
*  Michael, what do you think? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1818.8400000000001s)]
*  I agree with that analysis. I think it's spot on. Is this exactly where we are? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1821.56s)]
*  So I want to take what Amanda just said and just move it out a little bit further, because [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1825.88s)]
*  that is the sweet spot of the argument. Now let's deal with the ugly underbelly of the argument, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what any of this, how any of this plays out. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1836.2s)]
*  There's a narrative that's been set in motion around Donald Trump that regardless of outcome, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1840.5200000000002s)]
*  circumstances or situations, the end game is the same to empower him and to empower this movement [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1846.76s)]
*  that is enabling him, that will not hold him accountable for anything. So while the court [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1854.3600000000001s)]
*  is swinging and thinking and moving, and in some cases, as we've seen in some of the issues [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1861.0s)]
*  related to his free speech rights as a candidate, bending over backwards and trying to stay [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1867.4s)]
*  consistent with the constitutional norms and the rule of law, you have at hand within the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1874.84s)]
*  Republican Party itself among activists around the country a general consensus that this is all [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1882.84s)]
*  about Trump, and we will be there to make this real, make it realizable for him whether he [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1890.6s)]
*  is rejected by the American people or not, the narrative stays the same for them. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1897.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I really go back and forth on this. I think this is what John [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1902.1999999999998s)]
*  Wood said today in the USA Today, that trust in our civic and legal institutions among Republicans [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1907.24s)]
*  already at perilous lows would burn through the Earth's crust if the judicial system blocks the [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1913.6399999999999s)]
*  most popular GOP candidate from the ballot. I think he's right, but then at the same time, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1917.88s)]
*  it's also like, right, but if he loses fair and square, they're all going to freak out too. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1921.72s)]
*  Like at a certain point, like, you know, this is what drives me crazy about this whole discussion [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1928.1200000000001s)]
*  is like they we did it, the country did it, they people mobilize, they gathered, they had a free [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1932.5200000000002s)]
*  and free election, he lost by 7 million votes, it wasn't particularly close to the Electoral [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1936.7600000000002s)]
*  College, like, it all happened. There was a there was a magic wand to disqualify from office, it's [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1940.3600000000001s)]
*  called conviction on impeachment. And it tend like they could have done that too. So it's we have [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1946.44s)]
*  been through all this before the all these sort of questions about legitimacy, they're they're [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1951.56s)]
*  cracked. And I share them. And I worry too, what Melissa said a patchwork election where he's not [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1955.24s)]
*  in the ballot. But Amanda's ultimately a certain point, it's like, there's only so much I think [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1959.0s)]
*  you can be cowed by some sense of victimhood and umbrage by people who are going to always feel [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1963.8s)]
*  victimhood and umbrage unless Donald Trump's president full stop. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1970.76s)]
*  Well, this is exactly why we need the courts to resolve these questions quickly, because [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1974.92s)]
*  the people did decide right in 2020. And then Donald Trump stoked an insurrection to make them [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1980.6s)]
*  reject the results and there was no political accountability. So how do we have, you know, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1985.96s)]
*  this is what we focus on a lot of protect democracy. How do we have safe and secure [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1990.52s)]
*  elections that ensure freedom for all people? The courts do that. That's why we have to resolve [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=1995.16s)]
*  these questions now because if Donald Trump is not deterred through the courts, there's no reason [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2000.2s)]
*  to believe that he wouldn't do it again in 2024. So let's have these conversations now through a [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2004.44s)]
*  system where Donald Trump is afforded due process. He can present his arguments like he did, you know, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2009.88s)]
*  dozens of times after the election. Let's settle those questions there. So people aren't scaling [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2014.44s)]
*  the walls of the Capitol again. Yeah. And this speed question, I think is important, Michael, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2019.96s)]
*  not just on this, which I think they will they will move quickly, but on the jacks messed up, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2023.8s)]
*  because in some ways, one of the weird nightmare scenarios that I keep going through [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2027.08s)]
*  is that Trump's attempts at delay are successful enough to push a trial from March to say July, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2032.28s)]
*  at which point it's like, okay, now Republican primary voters haven't had the benefit of this [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2040.6s)]
*  being aired in a courtroom. They're everyone's flying. Then it's, oh, he has a conviction in [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2046.52s)]
*  July. Oh, you liberals set this deep state trap for him. And everyone freaks out. It's like, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2052.04s)]
*  right. That's why to Amanda's point, like speed and dispatch earlier, the better on all this stuff. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2057.08s)]
*  Well, you know, that's where that's where a lot of the judges in the myriad of cases right now are [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2063.32s)]
*  trying to move into that lane and try to speed up the process for that very reason. But I'm at a [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2068.2000000000003s)]
*  point, you know, Chris, where it doesn't really almost matter. We just have to gird ourselves as [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2076.52s)]
*  citizens who stand with organizations and individuals like Amanda and Protect Democracy, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2081.88s)]
*  who really do want to protect democracy and just instake our claim in the country, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  because this element doesn't go away. There's always going to be a reason they're going to be [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2092.84s)]
*  aggrieved and pissed off and angry because they're aggrieved and pissed off and angry. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2097.88s)]
*  I can't satiate that. You can't satiate that. The only way it can be satiated by them is to do what [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2103.4s)]
*  we saw in January six. So we allow that to happen or we don't. Yeah, this ultimately is, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2110.04s)]
*  I think, what I find. And again, I think these concerns about legitimacy are totally legit. And [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2116.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm partially persuaded. But there's just a heads I win, tails you lose set up to this, which is like [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2121.32s)]
*  he either wins or you like or he loses unfairly. And that's the way it's set up, you know, by [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2127.08s)]
*  design. Amanda Carpenter, Michael Steele. Great to have you both. Thank you. Yeah. Still had the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2133.08s)]
*  other big Trump case that is in the hands of the Supreme Court and the latest attempt by the ex [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2138.28s)]
*  president to delay and delay and delay. That's next. The question of whether Colorado can ban [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2144.6000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump from its presidential ballot is only one of the enormous questions that is likely going [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2155.96s)]
*  to end up before the Supreme Court. The court is also being asked to decide the hugely consequential [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2161.32s)]
*  question of the ex president's criminal immunity, specifically whether he is immune from even being [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2165.88s)]
*  charged or taking a trial for crimes he committed while he was president, in particular, his attempt [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2171.7200000000003s)]
*  to steal the 2020 election and stay in power. Now, today's Trump's lawyers urge the Supreme Court to [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2176.44s)]
*  reject special counsel's Jack Smith's request that they fast track a Supreme Court decision on this [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2183.08s)]
*  question of immunity. Trump's lawyers argued that the special counsel quote urges this court to [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2189.2400000000002s)]
*  decide the issue with reckless abandon. They accused Jack Smith of requesting an expeditious [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2193.88s)]
*  ruling not out of public interest, but out of, quote, partisan interest in ensuring that Trump [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2199.0s)]
*  will be subjected to a months long criminal trial at the height of a presidential campaign. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2202.84s)]
*  Joining me now is MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin. I mean, we all know the score. We all know they [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2207.8s)]
*  want to delay. So it's not surprising they said this. What did you think of the brief? I thought [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2214.52s)]
*  the brief has other surprises in it, right? Because you and I both know that the score here [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2220.44s)]
*  is delay, delay, delay. One of the things that was surprising to me is how sharp their language is [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2224.92s)]
*  about Jack Smith and his team as partisans here saying that it's not in the public interest to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  resolve this by leapfrogging the D.C. Circuit, that federal court of appeals that has jurisdiction [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2236.28s)]
*  here and going straight to the Supreme Court. Rather, it's a partisan interest that Jack Smith [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2241.16s)]
*  and his team are driving at. That's language that they're using in the campaign domain. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2245.7200000000003s)]
*  They've also used it in other cases, but I haven't seen them use it as sharply as they do in this [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2250.04s)]
*  brief telling the Supreme Court essentially that Jack Smith is a tool of the Biden administration [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2256.44s)]
*  and is doing this to ensure Biden's reelection. That's not language that I think will do well, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2261.24s)]
*  let's say, with the nine justices on this court. Two of them, maybe. Two of them. Yeah. But the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2267.24s)]
*  other seven, I think, will find that problematic, particularly given the lengths to which the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2273.48s)]
*  Department of Justice went to try and seal this case off from the usual processes. It's an [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2280.44s)]
*  interesting situation because this sort of highly unusual procedural maneuver, which is called [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2285.8s)]
*  assert before judgment, right? Which is you leapfrog the appellate court. Now, this court has done [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2291.96s)]
*  this a lot. This court has. This court, specifically, to a degree that has shocked a lot of people and [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2297.88s)]
*  invited a lot of criticism. That's right. If ever there was a case where you want to move quickly. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2304.12s)]
*  The other thing I guess I would say, and I'm going to play dumb for a second, is like, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2308.6s)]
*  if I were a person being prosecuted for a crime that I didn't think I was constitutionally [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2311.7200000000003s)]
*  eligible to prosecute for and I got an unfavorable ruling of the district court, I'd want the Supreme [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2315.7200000000003s)]
*  Court to weigh in as fast as possible and be like, this dude's immune, let him walk. Except that, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2320.76s)]
*  that would be if you only had one objective, which is to be free from prosecution and free from the [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2326.12s)]
*  legal costs that that entails. But of course, you and I both know that Trump has multiple objectives. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2330.76s)]
*  He wants to keep this going to a point in which there is no decision or conviction, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2335.48s)]
*  and yet he can be reelected and get rid of this case. And at the same time, he knows that these [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2340.52s)]
*  litigations are politically advantageous for him. They are a fundraising juggernaut. And so why turn [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2345.64s)]
*  off that spigot if you can continue the grift? I guess the point I'm trying to put a sharper [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2351.96s)]
*  point on it, I understand why they want to delay and why they don't want to serve before judgment, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2356.92s)]
*  but it also makes me think like they're not that confident in their immunity arguments. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2361.16s)]
*  No, of course they're not that confident in their immunity arguments. And in fact, one of the things [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2364.36s)]
*  they say in this brief that I think is kind of laughable is that the reason that in our 234 year [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2368.04s)]
*  history, we've never had a prosecution against a president despite ample motive and opportunity [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2373.8s)]
*  is because everybody presumes that you can't do it. No, that's not the reason. In fact, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2378.84s)]
*  everybody doesn't presume you can't do it. Kate Shaw, a lawyer you know well, said in the New York [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2383.56s)]
*  Times the other day that if everybody understood that you couldn't do it, there would have been no [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2387.96s)]
*  reason for former president Ford to pardon Nixon. The reason it hasn't been done is there's never [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2392.1200000000003s)]
*  been conduct this egregious on the other side of the line between criminal and borderline. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2397.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, and I agree. I thought that was a great point in Kate's op-ed, which basically says [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2404.6000000000004s)]
*  the Ford pardon, which is the most controversial president of its time and among the most ever, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2408.28s)]
*  contemplates, immunizes him essentially via pardon from future prosecution precisely because [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2414.76s)]
*  everyone in the country was expecting that's what was going to happen. Correct. And the [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2420.84s)]
*  investigation was going in that direction. So then there's the, okay, so we've circled back, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2424.44s)]
*  right? So there's going to be two decisions here. I just want to keep these straight. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2429.32s)]
*  There's the question about expedited cert before judgment go right to the Supreme Court. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2432.76s)]
*  Right. Independent of that, we're going through the normal channels of the DC [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2438.6s)]
*  Circuit. That's right. Which it appears to me is moving quickly and expeditiously and [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2442.52s)]
*  does seem to understand the urgency of time. They do understand the urgency. Certainly, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2446.12s)]
*  their briefing schedule as well as their oral argument schedule sets them up to rule expeditiously. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2449.64s)]
*  But if the Supreme Court thinks that they should just pause and wait for the DC Circuit, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2454.84s)]
*  that only elongates the timeframe here. Right. So that even if the DC Circuit moves expeditiously. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2459.08s)]
*  So this is really the question. So let's say Supreme Court says we're not giving this [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2465.08s)]
*  cert before judgment, which, you know, again, it is an extraordinary notion. It goes through [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2469.64s)]
*  the appellate court process and he loses there again, right? Chuck King is upheld. Now it comes [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2474.2799999999997s)]
*  to the combat. Now they're going to appeal, obviously, the Supreme Court. Right. So that's [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2479.16s)]
*  to me is when the question is called of whether the people on that court are going to basically [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2481.88s)]
*  bail him out through delay or not. Absolutely. Right. Like that is what it's going to be. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2487.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this is also a body that you and I were discussing earlier has just further [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2491.72s)]
*  undermined our confidence in them through the New York Times reporting last week about the fact [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2497.48s)]
*  they agreed to hear the Dobbs case and then kept that a secret from the American public [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2501.64s)]
*  for months at a time, knowing that it would undermine our confidence if they were transparent [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2506.3599999999997s)]
*  with us. So query how much you can trust these folks. However, I think there are some [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2511.16s)]
*  institutionalists on the court. And I was surprised today when I went back to two opinions from 2020 [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2517.0s)]
*  that deal with President Trump's amenability to criminal process, meaning does he have to [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2522.68s)]
*  turn over documents, finding that concurrence in the judgment and the Trump versus Vance case from [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2527.48s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh, where he says, of course, it's a board, you know, a functional principle of our [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2532.92s)]
*  democracy that nobody is above the law and that applies to presidents too. This is the ultimate [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2539.08s)]
*  test, Brett Kavanaugh, for you and how committed you are to that principle. Seven, two. Lisa Rubin, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0Dv8HKRTI&t=2543.48s)]
