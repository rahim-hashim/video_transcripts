# Judge slams Trump DOJ for ‘woefully insufficient’ response, 'evading' deadline
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk)
*  Today in the wake of the Trump administration invoking a 1798 law to ship hundreds of Venezuelan migrants out of the country in apparent defiance of a court order, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=0.0s)]
*  the federal judge overseeing that case responded to what the Trump Department of Justice submitted, writing, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=9.0s)]
*  quote, the government again evaded its obligations and that its response was woefully insufficient. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=14.0s)]
*  The judge ordered the government to file a brief by Tuesday showing cause on why they violated the order and failed to turn the planes, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=20.0s)]
*  headed to the supermax prison in El Salvador, around. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=27.0s)]
*  Lee Gelernt is the lead counsel on this case, deputy director of the ACLU's immigrant rights project, and he joins me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=30.0s)]
*  Lee, it really seems like the government right now is kind of sort of disobeying the court while pretending not to or doing like the least possible. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=37.0s)]
*  Like, how do you understand where we are with this case? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I think there are two parts to it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=50.0s)]
*  As you know, one is, did the government violate the court's order by not turning the planes around and bringing the individuals back after he had ordered a stop to the policy, a temporary stop? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=53.0s)]
*  The other part of it, of course, is is what the president's doing with this wartime authority lawful. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=64.0s)]
*  And so what you're referring to is the part about defying his orders. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=70.0s)]
*  You know, we think the facts are pretty clear, but we are not going to get ahead of the judge. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=74.0s)]
*  We're going to allow the judge to find these facts and ultimately decide whether his own order was violated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=79.0s)]
*  And if he finds that the order was violated, we are going to certainly ask him to get these individuals back. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=85.0s)]
*  Normally, a federal judge can't order another country to do something or release people in their prisons. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=91.0s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear, though, that the U.S. is running the show here and they're constructively in U.S. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=96.0s)]
*  Constituting and El Seller is essentially functioning like a private prison. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=101.0s)]
*  So we will see what the judge does with whether the facts and whether they violated the order and then ask him for various forms of relief, but most prominently ask him to bring the individuals back on the other question. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=105.0s)]
*  The other question, you know, the main question in the case, was the use of this 1798 law lawful? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=118.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. Congress could not have been clear. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=124.0s)]
*  You can use it when there is a foreign governor nation in a declared war, a declared war with the United States or a foreign governor nation is invading our country or making predatory incursions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=128.0s)]
*  The law could not be clear. And so, you know, you and I have talked about this a lot, Chris, that sort of this is fundamentally a separation of powers question. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=141.0s)]
*  The president is just thumbing his nose on the limitations Congress put in the law. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=148.0s)]
*  And those limitations have been clear for the entire 200 plus years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=152.0s)]
*  The law has been in existence. The law has only been invoked three times in our country's history, all during declared wars, the War of 1812, World War One and World War Two, and infamously in World War Two to intern people of Japanese descent. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=156.0s)]
*  And so now all of a sudden the president said, well, I'm just going to use it against the gang. And you can't review what I'm doing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=171.0s)]
*  If the president gets away with this, then anybody can be designated an enemy alien and shipped off to a Salvadoran prison. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=176.0s)]
*  And those Salvadoran prisons, as you said in the introduction, supermax prisons, our plaintiffs are in real, real trouble there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=184.0s)]
*  And on the anybody front, I should I should say here that even if someone belongs to a terrible gang and has done terrible things, they shouldn't be unreviewably shipped off to one of these prisons. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=191.0s)]
*  But and also there seems very compelling evidence. The plaintiffs in this case had nothing to do with this gang. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=203.0s)]
*  Like maybe they got a rose tattoo at a Dallas tattoo parlor or one of them was a soccer player with a tattoo that that they got to, you know, that looks a little like their favorite soccer club in Europe and now have been snatched and thrown into this prison. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you made that point, Chris, because we have two arguments. One is the law can't be used at all. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=225.0s)]
*  So wartime authority during peacetime. But even if it could, even if it could, the individuals must be given due process to show that they're not part of this gang. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=232.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court has made that crystal clear forever that when this law is used, the limited time it's been used, you have to have due process to show you're not part of the gang. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=241.0s)]
*  And our plaintiffs dispute that there are members of the gang. More and more evidence is coming out that the people shipped to El Salvador are not part of a gang. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=250.0s)]
*  I think we're going to see that over and over. And this is a pattern with the Trump administration. They ship people to Guantanamo and say these are the worst of the worst. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=258.0s)]
*  Even the government had to eventually concede in court filings in our case that they were not actually high level criminals, but low level or no or no, no criminal activity. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=265.0s)]
*  And so I think we're going to see the same pattern here. But these individuals are now hopefully they are, you know, going to get stay out of trouble. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=275.0s)]
*  But I think they're in real trouble in El Salvador prisons. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should also say there's reporting today that the own intelligence assessment inside the U.S. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=286.0s)]
*  government found that the gang in question here is not controlled by the government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=290.0s)]
*  That to invoke war crime deportation powers, the president asserted that they control a gang. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=296.0s)]
*  But U.S. intelligence analysts think that that is not true. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=300.0s)]
*  I mean, this whole thing just seems like such a stack of absurdities. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=303.0s)]
*  Lee Lerner, who's been litigating this case. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=306.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=308.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA2_9W6beFk&t=316.0s)]
