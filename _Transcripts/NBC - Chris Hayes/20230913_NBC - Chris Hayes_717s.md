# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg)
*  Kevin McCarthy is not a complicated dude. People who cover him or know him will really not dispute the fact. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no deep political strategy behind what he does, nor does there appear to be particularly zealous ideological motivation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=6.0s)]
*  Right now, Kevin McCarthy wants to stay in power as Speaker of the House. He likes that job. He wants to be the Speaker. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=14.0s)]
*  He will do whatever it takes to accomplish those goals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=19.0s)]
*  And partly we know this because back in 2016, when no one thought Donald Trump was going to take over the Republican Party, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=22.0s)]
*  this is what the same Kevin McCarthy had to say about him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=28.0s)]
*  He begins by saying, I'll guarantee you that's what it is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=31.0s)]
*  The Russians hacked the DNC and got the op research that they had on Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=36.0s)]
*  And then McCarthy laughs. McCarthy then adds, there's two people I think Putin pays, Rohrbacher and Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=42.0s)]
*  There's then laughter by some of the lawmakers in the room. And then McCarthy adds, swear to God. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=50.0s)]
*  But then Trump won, and it became clear to the likes of McCarthy and every other Trump skeptic in the party that proximity to him was crucial for retaining power. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=58.0s)]
*  In one particularly telling example, while having dessert on Air Force One, McCarthy noticed Trump was eating only red and pink starburst candies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=66.0s)]
*  So he bought a bag and he had an aide pick out only those two flavors and then delivered them in a jar to Donald Trump in the White House with his own name on it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=75.0s)]
*  For what it's worth, Trump was reportedly giddy with this gesture, I can imagine. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=85.0s)]
*  That is the kind of stuff Kevin McCarthy is willing to do to ingratiate himself to the source of power in Republican politics. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=89.0s)]
*  So today, McCarthy announced he is getting to work plucking Donald Trump's red and pink starbursts out of the bowl in a far more dangerous and craven fashion by endorsing the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden that the ex-president has been loudly demanding, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=95.0s)]
*  including apparently at a dinner with McCarthy's top advisor, Marjorie Taylor Greene, over the weekend. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=111.0s)]
*  It's obvious why Greene and her folks want impeachment, but isn't it obvious what they think it should be for? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=117.0s)]
*  Like think about like the one sentence description. In 1868, Andrew Johnson was impeached because he defied Congress and sabotaged reconstruction after the Civil War. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=125.0s)]
*  In 1998, Bill Clinton was impeached because he had a sexual affair with an intern and then lied about it under oath. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=134.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was impeached twice, once in 2020 for using the power of his office to extort the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political opponent, a second time in 2021 for inciting a deadly riot at the Capitol on January 6. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=140.0s)]
*  What's the one sentence version of this one? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=154.0s)]
*  We don't know why Joe Biden is the subject of impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=158.0s)]
*  No Republicans been able to describe it so succinctly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=161.0s)]
*  That said, the political math of this is not hard to understand. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=165.0s)]
*  You see, McCarthy has a five vote margin in the House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=168.0s)]
*  He's got a faction in his conference that is devoted to Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=170.0s)]
*  He probably right now does not have the votes to either pass a must pass spending bill or to get a House vote on an impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=174.0s)]
*  So he's got the votes for neither and he's trying to pull off a miracle by like combining them to get the votes for one maybe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=182.0s)]
*  In the meantime, alienating all sides of his party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=189.0s)]
*  So today he announced an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden without a vote, something he strenuously objected to back when the Democrats controlled the House, in fact introduced a congressional resolution opposing it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=192.0s)]
*  And he's doing this ridiculous exercise again without a vote, hoping that that will help him get the votes he needs to pass the must pass funding bills and keep the government open. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=204.0s)]
*  So far, I'm not sure that's working. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=215.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=218.0s)]
*  The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total compliance or remove you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=225.0s)]
*  Now, that guy's bark to bite ratio is like 10,000 to one. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=234.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't take too much stock there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=238.0s)]
*  But McCarthy in trying to do this thing, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=241.0s)]
*  Like I'll give you the impeachment inquiry. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=243.0s)]
*  Give me the vote. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=244.0s)]
*  It's like a guy who loans a ton of money and a loan sharks after him and it's up against the deadline. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=245.0s)]
*  So he goes to a second loan shark to take another loan to pay off the first loan shark. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=251.0s)]
*  But maybe you get through today and you wake up tomorrow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=255.0s)]
*  But eventually it's all going to come due. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=259.0s)]
*  Right now, the idea that is politically advantageous to go along with impeaching Joe Biden is belied by the fact that McCarthy doesn't have the votes to do it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=263.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the votes to open an inquiry. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=274.0s)]
*  And the reason he doesn't is because the very swing district Republicans he needs on his side for such a vote understand the politics are terrible. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=276.0s)]
*  This is paralyzing the Department of Defense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=286.0s)]
*  You know, the idea that one man in the Senate can hold this up for months. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=290.0s)]
*  I understand maybe promotions, but nominations is paralyzing the Department of Defense. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=294.0s)]
*  I think that is a national security problem and a national security issue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=301.0s)]
*  I was ahead of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican Congressman Michael McCaul blasting Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville for his unprecedented military blockade in the Senate. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=307.0s)]
*  For over six months, the Republican has single handedly blocked over 300 military promotions due to what he calls, quote, woke Pentagon policies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=318.0s)]
*  I got to say, I am quite sure if a Democratic senator was doing this, they would be absolutely dogpiled by their Democratic colleagues. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=328.0s)]
*  But this from McCaul appears to be the first sort of big public criticism from a prominent Republican congressman. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=335.0s)]
*  We'll see if any others join to put pressure on the Alabama senator and his efforts to force pregnancy, among other things, on military members while also gutting the armed forces personnel. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=341.0s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly is a Democrat of Arizona. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=351.0s)]
*  He's a 25 year U.S. Navy veteran who served as a combat pilot and now sits on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=354.0s)]
*  And he joins me. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=360.0s)]
*  What are the conversations happening in the U.S. Senate and on that Armed Services Committee about this blockade and what it what it means? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, among my Democrat and Republican colleagues, I mean, it's how do we how do we get through this? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=372.0s)]
*  You know, let me first point out, Chris, that this is unprecedented. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=379.0s)]
*  You know, the Senator Tuberville has done something that has not been done in U.S. history. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=383.0s)]
*  I mean, hold up nominations and promotions of admirals and generals for it's now been over six months. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=388.0s)]
*  And this has a serious negative effect on our national security. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=394.0s)]
*  I mean, I was talking to one of my Republican colleagues today about just the consequences of this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=399.0s)]
*  And and they get it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=403.0s)]
*  And it really comes down to at some point here, Senator Tuberville is going to have to release these holds because we cannot continue month after month. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=405.0s)]
*  This is doing serious damage and it's not just short term. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=414.0s)]
*  It's this isn't like a light switch, like you turn it back on and everything's fine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=417.0s)]
*  This is going to do damage to me, to our military, possibly for years to come. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=421.0s)]
*  Michael McCall criticized Senator Tuberville over the weekend. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=427.0s)]
*  That's how we just played. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=431.0s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar was on this show last week basically saying we need Republicans to come out against this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=432.0s)]
*  And I think if the shoe were on the other foot, if there was a Democrat doing this, I think you'd probably start to see that criticism. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=438.0s)]
*  Pretty quickly. Is that the is that how you map out the end of this, which is basically enough? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=443.0s)]
*  Co-partisans pressure him enough that he relents? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=449.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what we've been waiting for and hoping for. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=452.0s)]
*  And I've had multiple conversations with Republicans about, you know, putting pressure on them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=456.0s)]
*  We've been putting pressure on them. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=460.0s)]
*  This is, you know, I mean, this is over a rather straightforward policy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=462.0s)]
*  And and and Chris, do you know like who is celebrating this right now? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=468.0s)]
*  You know, the Chinese government, the Chinese military, there's probably in the Chinese embassy here, there's probably champagne corks popping over this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=472.0s)]
*  This is very good for them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=480.0s)]
*  This is very good for Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=482.0s)]
*  This is very bad for the U.S. military. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=484.0s)]
*  We've got to find a way forward. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=486.0s)]
*  I just want to be clear for folks that don't know this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=488.0s)]
*  Basically, one of his ask, I think, is to reverse a Pentagon policy that reimburses service members for travel to secure reproductive care. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=490.0s)]
*  And and that is a longstanding policy for health care. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=499.0s)]
*  So it's not even a new policy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=505.0s)]
*  It just includes reproductive care. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=507.0s)]
*  Now, your your colleague in Arizona, Christian Sinema, said we what we need are for folks to step off a little bit from their positions and find that middle ground to serve the people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=509.0s)]
*  Middle ground to solve the challenge that we're facing appears to be middle ground between Senator Tuberville and the Pentagon and the Biden administration. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=519.0s)]
*  Do you think that's the way out of this? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, as you mentioned, I spent 25 years in the United States Navy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=531.0s)]
*  It is it is a challenge personally. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=536.0s)]
*  And, you know, I give so much credit for, you know, especially the young members in the military, but folks that serve 30 something years, 35 years that reach these, you know, the highest ranks in our military, they have sacrificed. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=539.0s)]
*  Their families have sacrificed. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=553.0s)]
*  It's a challenge. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=555.0s)]
*  And you don't get to decide where you're going to live. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=556.0s)]
*  I mean, if somebody stationed in Alabama or Mississippi and they can't get the health care that folks can get in another state, they can't choose not to go. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=559.0s)]
*  I mean, we can't have a system where, you know, women that serve in our military are denied health care. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=568.0s)]
*  And yet that seems to be the position Senator Tuberville, who is a quarter of one man wrecking crew on this issue. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=577.0s)]
*  Is there is there any escalation procedurally that you see happening here? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=585.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, unanimous consent to sacrosanct in the body in which you serve. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=589.0s)]
*  It gives each of you individual senators power. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=593.0s)]
*  So you have a kind of game theoretical reason to all like it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=595.0s)]
*  But is there anything you can see happening? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=600.0s)]
*  Well, Chris, at this point, I don't like it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=602.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's been a mistake. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=604.0s)]
*  I mean, that one senator has the ability to do this much damage to our military. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=606.0s)]
*  I mean, think about that for a second. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=611.0s)]
*  I mean, I know, you know, I know a general in the Air Force who his his wife has just gotten over cancer. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=613.0s)]
*  He was planning on retiring and now he can't even spend time with her. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=620.0s)]
*  She's moved. He is still in his job. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=624.0s)]
*  I had the the woman who is going to lead the United States Navy if she's ever confirmed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=627.0s)]
*  She was in my office today. She's now going to have two jobs. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=633.0s)]
*  She's going to be the deputy CNO as well. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=636.0s)]

*  I think people would get this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=664.0s)]

*  We've had the best military and fighting force in the world. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=687.0s)]
*  This is doing serious damage and it's on Tuberville to lift this. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCW8A9O3WYg&t=690.0s)]
