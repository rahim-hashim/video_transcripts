# ‘Desperate and thirsty’: DeSantis flop due to ‘weird, alienating, hard-right campaign’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Hope you had a good July 4th weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=0.0s)]
*  We are rapidly approaching the real actual serious for now start of the 24 Republican primary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=4.0s)]
*  The first RNC debate is next month in Milwaukee where the Republicans will also hold their 2024 convention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=10.0s)]
*  And while it's still too early for any real predictions about who voters will choose or how this song going to play out, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=17.0s)]
*  right now, speaking as of today, it does look like Donald Trump is way ahead of everyone else. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=22.0s)]
*  And that's in large part because Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was initially hyped up as the candidate who could take on Trump, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=28.0s)]
*  has seen his poll numbers tank. Just look at the polling averages since the start of this calendar year. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=35.0s)]
*  DeSantis' line should come with its own slide whistle. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=42.0s)]
*  He's almost 30 points behind Trump at an average of the national polls. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=45.0s)]
*  Even a top official at a pro DeSantis super PAC recently conceded the Florida governor's campaign has been a bust so far. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=49.0s)]
*  It just we have work to do. We have wood to chop. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=79.0s)]
*  Now, it does seem like a bad sign when one of your top surrogates has to admit that your opponent is the runaway front runner, although, you know, credit where due. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=82.0s)]
*  It's true, at least. And there are a lot of reasons that DeSantis campaign is doing so poorly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=89.0s)]
*  One reason is what some are calling a lack of charisma, which seems to be alienating voters on the campaign trail, especially in those early states where you do a lot of retail politicking. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=93.0s)]
*  You could judge yourself. Here he is in action during a campaign stop at the southern border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=103.0s)]
*  There were people I was reading from Tajikistan coming to the southern border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=109.0s)]
*  I remember seeing Libya there now have I think they've identified about 10,000 Chinese nationals coming across the southern border. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=114.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, there's no accounting for taste. But does that do that for you? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=125.0s)]
*  I don't know. The candidate quality issues are only partially to blame for DeSantis' decline, however. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=129.0s)]
*  A big part of the reason I would submit that he has failed to gain any traction is he has chosen whether he realizes or not to run this weird alienating hard right campaign like a Ron DeSantis doesn't care who he offends kind of thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=134.0s)]
*  And again, I understand the logic here because it really is the case that there's an appetite for that kind of thing in the Republican base. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=150.0s)]
*  And he thinks, I think, if I can game it out, he can gain some traction in the darkest, most anti-social corners of the Internet where cruelty is a virtue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=156.0s)]
*  But I think even those folks and the people he's trying to appeal to will find his campaign's latest video to be as desperate and thirsty as the rest of us do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=166.0s)]
*  But if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=186.0s)]
*  In the future, can transgender women compete in this universe? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=196.0s)]
*  Yes. Make America great again. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=202.0s)]
*  Sike! [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=204.0s)]
*  I cannot think of anything more horrifying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=216.0s)]
*  It really has shut down drag. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=224.0s)]
*  Just produced some of the harshest, most draconian laws that literally threaten trans existence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=227.0s)]
*  Congratulations, Ron DeSantis. Mission accomplished. You win. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=234.0s)]
*  Okay, there's a lot to say here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=246.0s)]
*  First, let me just say I understand I am probably you are not the target audience for that video, which again, fine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=255.0s)]
*  But everything about it is just so strange and so entirely alienating. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=263.0s)]
*  I mean, yes, it's bait for folks like me, right? Oh, the liberals, including me in that video, they don't like Don DeSantis. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=268.0s)]
*  Therefore, you should like him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=274.0s)]
*  But again, that's lost underneath the crushing weight of the sheer effort of the uber online Twitter nerds who came up with this, who cannot or will not understand how to act and interact with other people like a normal person. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=275.0s)]
*  In fact, I would go so far as to say the most people are not even the target audience for this video. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=294.0s)]
*  I mean, even most Republicans are not the target audience for this video. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=298.0s)]
*  When you're trying to compare yourself favorably to the serial killer from American Psycho, you may have lost the thread a bit. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=301.0s)]
*  When you've hired campaign staffers, one of whom tweeted the video, who have lauded praise on Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=311.0s)]
*  Who like to hang out in the parts of the Internet where people impress each other with how much of an edged word they are and how they're never going to get married or have any kind of romantic relationship. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, maybe this is the kind of campaign you end up running. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=327.0s)]
*  So you've got a disgusting, you know, whatever homophobic offensive video released on the last day of Pride Month because again, this is all overly determined, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=330.0s)]
*  They're trying to incite a backlash and I get that this video exists again for that purpose. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=340.0s)]
*  Like we all see what you're doing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=346.0s)]
*  There's nothing subtle here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=347.0s)]
*  But again, even on its own terms, I think you missed the mark. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=348.0s)]
*  My strong instinct is that even to the base, this comes across like Jeb's infamous please clap moment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=352.0s)]
*  Like look at how edgy we are. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=359.0s)]
*  On that show where Steve Cortez admits DeSantis is behind it by a mile, the host in an informal and unscientific survey of his very online listener. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=361.0s)]
*  Oh, it's Crypto Lawyer, of course, which had Trump trouncing DeSantis by 60 points. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=371.0s)]
*  So he's not even winning over the kind of like hyper engaged Twitter people he's targeting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=377.0s)]
*  And then, of course, there are costs to this kind of thing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=382.0s)]
*  I mean, politics is addition, not subtraction, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=385.0s)]
*  It's cliche, but it's true. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=387.0s)]
*  Many prominent LGBTQ Republicans who are at least somewhat supportive of DeSantis are now turning their backs on him. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=389.0s)]
*  As Philip Bump points out in The Washington Post today, you can't out conservative Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=395.0s)]
*  You can't outmag him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=399.0s)]
*  You can't out Trump Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=401.0s)]
*  There is no opening to run to his right on the culture war stuff. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=402.0s)]
*  Quote, DeSantis was seen as the alternative to Trump by those who didn't like Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=406.0s)]
*  It seems increasingly apparent he's now seen as the alternative to Trump by those who do like Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=410.0s)]
*  As long as Trump is in the race and as long as the race centers on Trump's worldview, DeSantis won't be able to pass him. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=415.0s)]
*  Again, I'm an outsider looking in here and I will be the first to admit it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=422.0s)]
*  And I will be the first to admit that you don't necessarily go to Chris Hayes for like the most obvious insight into the thinking of the median Republican primary voter stipulated. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=426.0s)]
*  But again, my two cents, if you want to beat Donald Trump, the Republican primary, here's what I think is obvious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=435.0s)]
*  You need to kind of comfort his voters and keep them in your fold, right? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=441.0s)]
*  You cannot be seen as anti-Trump. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=444.0s)]
*  Totally get that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=445.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=446.0s)]
*  But then you got to convince them you're a better and more electable alternative and then add them to the people who were not that interested in voting for Trump again, the primary. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=447.0s)]
*  That's how you add up the coalition big enough to win. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=454.0s)]
*  You are not going to get there by trying to convince the biggest dorks on the Internet that you are even more of a callous psychopath than he is. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=456.0s)]
*  . [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlE7h-6IuM&t=484.0s)]
