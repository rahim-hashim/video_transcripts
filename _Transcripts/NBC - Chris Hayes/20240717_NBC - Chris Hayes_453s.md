# ‘Drunk the Kool-Aid’: Hear JD Vance’s old roommate on MAGA transformation
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA)
*  Later tonight, we're gonna hear from Ohio senator JD Vance as he addresses the country as Trump's vice presidential pick today in his first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=0.0s)]
*  Campaign appearance in that position Vance called his running mate Donald Trump a real leader and a great president [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=7.36s)]
*  We're gonna hear much more of that later tonight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But we do not expect to hear any more of this kind of stuff tonight critical comments [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=15.6s)]
*  That's made about Trump when he ran for president the first time in 2016 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=19.88s)]
*  Here's a sampling I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a-hole like Nixon [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Who wouldn't be that bad and might even prove useful or that Trump is America's Hitler? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=28.9s)]
*  The guy JD Vance wrote that text to his old Yale Law School roommate and current Georgia State Senator Josh McLaurin [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=34.18s)]
*  Joins us now a state senator McLaurin. Thanks for spending a little time with us this evening [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=41.22s)]
*  The first thing I got to ask you is you know in your time in the Ivy Leagues [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=46.2s)]
*  With with JD Vance. Did you get any inkling of the deep? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  Disgust he apparently has for Ivy League intellectuals who he now believes are part of a regime that has developed an economic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=56.8s)]
*  Platform that is distinctly at odds with what is good for quote-unquote real America [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=64.6s)]
*  Did you sense that kind of I'll call it populism when you were rooming with him in the Ivy Leagues? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  Hi, Alex and Chris a great to join you. I mean in a word. Yes, but it was limited, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean so much of this MAGA stuff is performance, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=79.88s)]
*  You have to choose to really lay it on thick but it may come from you know, some legitimate gripes or anger that some voters have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=83.66s)]
*  I mean there's anger on both sides, but it's a choice to turn that into contempt [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=89.96s)]
*  And I think that that's what JD has been doing ever since getting into politics and why he's such an effective communicator and amplifier [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=93.82s)]
*  For the MAGA movement, but at the time in 2010, I really liked him at first. I think a lot of people did too [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=100.58s)]
*  He's charismatic one-on-one. He's intelligent and he had thoughtful things to say about conservative positions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=106.6s)]
*  Like he didn't just echo all of the unlimited gun rights talking points [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=113.1s)]
*  For example, he once told me he thought the Second Amendment was a paradox because it's law [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=116.4s)]
*  But it's also you know preserving the right of people maybe to overthrow their government, which is inconsistent with law and order [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=120.74s)]
*  So, I mean he was thoughtful about things like that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=126.24s)]
*  But you know, he was skeptical of the law school environment [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=128.8s)]
*  That's one of the reasons he and I didn't get along so well as the years went by or really the months [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=131.24s)]
*  I mean we figured out quickly but then into the foreseeable future is that he had a very caustic and sarcastic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=135.36s)]
*  Sense of humor about the law school and some of the people there and I mean I ran the comedy show a law school [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=140.6s)]
*  So I was trying to have maybe a good time [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=145.56s)]
*  So I think what we're seeing now is that anger that he had maybe from childhood who knows it kind of doesn't matter [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=147.72s)]
*  He is now taking that anger and saying he wants to impose that bad feeling that contempt on the whole country [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=153.28s)]
*  Because of his great distrust for and the caricature that he's made out of media the left whatever his political opponents might be I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=160.26s)]
*  You know you received that text where he calls Trump potentially America's Hitler he's now [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=167.44s)]
*  The running mate to a man he called potentially America's Hitler [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Does that I mean I understand the anger and the contempt and the the grievous rage [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=177.04s)]
*  But but to seed your values it sounds like if you're someone who's skeptical of the Second Amendment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=181.88s)]
*  You know standing in line with Trump shoulder to shoulder. I mean [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Does that make sense? Does that comport with the person you once knew? It's a staggering 180 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean we all know it doesn't make sense. Right? So then we're all like grasping to explain it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  and you can imagine I've had a lot of conversations with old friends and knew about this moment and the thing that keeps coming up is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=200.16s)]
*  When you think that your opponent is evil or you think your opponent is worthy of contempt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=207.04s)]
*  Then your principles don't really matter anymore [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  If you the bigger you make your enemy into the more cartoonish your enemy is whatever principles or thoughtfulness you might have had [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  You can just throw those by the wayside because it's justified by that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Contempt and so I think what we've seen with him is he had a gut reaction like so many of us did to Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=223.6s)]
*  He said this guy's clearly like [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=228.8s)]
*  Narcissistic he's a fraud. I mean he was saying that Trump was a fraud all the way until 2021 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=231.28s)]
*  You know, there's recently unearthed audio to that effect. So it's not like he doesn't get it. He was very insightful [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=235.4s)]
*  I mean the text he sent me said that Trump was [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  the the fruit of collective neglect by the Republican Party who was ignoring the working class and that he was a demagogue who was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=243.24s)]
*  Exploiting the failures of his party that is sophisticated analysis that still holds true [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=249.86s)]
*  I think that's what makes him more than just an ordinary flip-flopper, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=254.62s)]
*  Like plenty of Republican elected officials were against Trump before they were for Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=258.02s)]
*  And I think that's why the campaign is trying to treat it like old news [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=261.94s)]
*  But JD's different and I think more dangerous because rather than just be an empty suit who's sort of parroting MAGA talking points [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=264.74s)]
*  I think that he has let his anger really take over his life and make him convinced that Trump is the right choice for America [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=271.06s)]
*  I don't think he's going home and having a whiskey and putting his feet up and saying oh man that Trump guy is crazy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=278.26000000000005s)]
*  But I have to defend him on TV [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  I think he's at this point so angry so motivated by that that spirit of revenge that Trump has publicly espoused [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=284.74s)]
*  That he's the perfect running mate for Trump [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  Which I've said recently and also that he he's really amplifying the the MAGA moment and doubling down instead of being a more moderate pick [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=294.06s)]
*  Yeah that on that last point [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=302.06s)]
*  I spent the last few days doing a lot of reading of JD Vance interviews with him things that he's written [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=303.98s)]
*  Some of the profiles of him a lot of his social media production and my thesis from afar is that he he has [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  radicalized himself that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=319.18s)]
*  Whatever began as opportunism a sort of plant growing towards the light as it were this is obviously the path to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=321.02s)]
*  Power and status in the Republican Party that's obviously inseparable from this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=327.1s)]
*  But that he's a true believer in all this in the same way that like we've watched Elon Musk basically self-radicalized in real time online [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  We've watched a bunch of these people do this and that I'm just curious what you think of that as a theory because I think [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=338.58s)]
*  A lot of it's about the opportunism that we've been hearing but to me [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=343.78s)]
*  I see someone who is fully committed to this agenda when he says to a Vanity Fair reporter [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  The president should fire every mid-level bureaucrat and then defy the Supreme Court when they strike it down. I don't think that's posture [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree I mean I think you can think of it in addition to being opportunism for his political advancement [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=358.54s)]
*  It's also opportunism to be a jerk, right? I mean, that's why I tweeted recently [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=364.38s)]
*  I think that this is a triumph for angry jerks everywhere [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=368.14s)]
*  I really mean that because even if JD is just mostly angry on TV [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=370.3s)]
*  He is creating the same permission structure that Trump has spent years creating which is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=374.42s)]
*  Ordinary Americans can show contempt towards one another and nothing will happen to you, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=379.02s)]
*  It's like what you hear about in schools bullying increasing this moment being deleterious for the whole country's culture [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=382.74s)]
*  So I think that JD is he really either underestimates or doesn't care the effect of this type of contempt spilling over [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=388.46s)]
*  into [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  Everyday life and further deteriorating our political culture [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  I agree with you that I think that he has drunk the Kool-Aid [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=401.62s)]
*  Wholesale because that's the way to motivate his sincerity when he brings that kind of anger to his messaging [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=404.9s)]
*  It's one way to motivate sincerity just sheer contempt and rage [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=410.54s)]
*  Georgia State Senator Joshua McLaurin. Thanks for really providing some very helpful analysis and perspective really appreciate it. Oh, thank you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUd9nSb5beA&t=415.18s)]
