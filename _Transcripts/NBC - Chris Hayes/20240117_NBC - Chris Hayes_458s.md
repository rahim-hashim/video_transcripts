# Bernie Sanders: Netanyahu tells Biden ‘Screw you’ on Gaza de-escalation
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I)
*  Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate urging his colleagues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=0.0s)]
*  to pass a resolution asking for accountability that would require the Biden administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=5.08s)]
*  to report on possible, quote, violations of internationally recognized human rights by [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=9.08s)]
*  the government of Israel and to certify that, quote, no unit of the Israeli security forces [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=14.36s)]
*  receiving U.S. assistance has committed any gross violations of human rights. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=19.06s)]
*  Only 11 senators of the 100 supported moving the resolution to even be considered for a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=25.2s)]
*  vote. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=29.64s)]
*  The vast majority voted to just table it without even bringing it to a vote. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=30.64s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=34.84s)]
*  He chairs the Health, Education and Labor Committee. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=37.44s)]
*  It's good to have you, Senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=39.88s)]
*  First, just some context here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=40.88s)]
*  My understanding is that it is already the case under U.S. law, and this is due to things [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=42.2s)]
*  that happened during the Cold War in which the U.S. was supplying arms to various governments [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=46.0s)]
*  that were using those arms then for human rights abuses, that it's already a part of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=51.6s)]
*  that the State Department has to certify when they give weapons to anyone, doesn't matter [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=56.44s)]
*  who it is, that those weapons are not being used to violate international humanitarian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=60.08s)]
*  law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Chris, this is a longstanding law that says something that's very sensible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  If the taxpayers of this country are providing military equipment to any nation on earth, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=70.2s)]
*  we have to make sure that that country is using it consistent with international law [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=75.64s)]
*  and human rights. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=81.32s)]
*  This is longstanding. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=82.32s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=83.32s)]
*  And so, explain to me what the vote was on yesterday in that context. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  What the vote was on yesterday was to have the State Department do a study on whether [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  or not Israel was violating international law and human rights. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=99.52s)]
*  And given the fact that many of the weapons that Israel has used in the last 100 days [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=108.36s)]
*  come from the United States of America, we certainly have a right to know that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=115.6s)]
*  My view from day one, Chris, has been that Israel has the right to respond to Hamas's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=122.04s)]
*  barbaric attack on October 7th, but they do not have the right to go to war against the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=129.24s)]
*  entire Palestinian people, which is what we are seeing right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=134.48s)]
*  And as you've just mentioned, the humanitarian situation in Gaza now is unbelievably bad, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  and we're looking at the possibility of hundreds of thousands of children starving. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  We cannot allow that to happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  We've had reporting throughout here, and I think it's quite established, that the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=152.72s)]
*  Biden administration, through Secretary Blinken, through Jake Sullivan, even in person-to-person [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  calls between the president and Benjamin Netanyahu have been urging a timeline, a vision for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  a post-conflict form of reconstruction to ratchet down the intensity and scale of bombardment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  As of yet, that doesn't seem like it's happening. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=175.98s)]
*  I just wonder, like, as a U.S. senator, does anyone have any sense of a timeline here? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=178.82s)]
*  Is this when this might, when this phase of this war might end? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  I think there is a huge frustration when we see President Biden appropriately saying [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=189.38s)]
*  that he is concerned about indiscriminate bombing and the humanitarian disaster urging [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=196.66s)]
*  Netanyahu and his right-wing government to do the right thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=203.66s)]
*  And Netanyahu basically says, hey, you know, screw you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=207.5s)]
*  We will do exactly what we want to do and when we want to do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=210.94s)]
*  The bombing right now, you know, what we are looking at, I want people to appreciate this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=215.2s)]
*  70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=219.48s)]
*  You've got 1.9 million people who have been displaced from their homes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=226.2s)]
*  They need food, they need water, they need medical supplies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=230.32s)]
*  As I mentioned a moment ago, children are now on the verge of starvation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=234.06s)]
*  This is not what the people of America want when they provide billions of dollars to Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=239.6s)]
*  And it's high time that we told Netanyahu that he's not getting another nickel unless [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=246.12s)]
*  he radically changes his attitude towards the Palestinian people and the nature of his [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=251.6s)]
*  military campaign. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=258.68s)]
*  Two of your colleagues, I think, if I'm not mistaken, I believe it was Senator Van Hollen [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=260.84s)]
*  and Senator Merkley, both went to Ra'afah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=266.14s)]
*  That of course is the border town between Gaza and Egypt proper. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=269.6s)]
*  And Jeff Merkley wrote this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=275.08s)]
*  I just want to read it to you and get your reaction because there's a bunch of issues [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=276.08s)]
*  in getting that humanitarian aid in. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=279.08s)]
*  Senator Merkley writing that trucks filled with food, water and medical supplies are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=281.36s)]
*  lined up waiting to be granted entry into Gaza. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=284.4s)]
*  Even if all the items on our truck have been pre-approved by Israel to ensure they are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=287.24s)]
*  not, quote, dual use items that have a potential military purpose, Israeli authorities can [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=290.32s)]
*  and do still reject some items as an inspection site. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=294.8s)]
*  And then this is interesting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=297.68s)]
*  And if a single item is rejected, the entire truckload is rejected. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=298.92s)]
*  How concerned are people, you and your colleagues, about the specter of mass starvation, which [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=303.92s)]
*  is what the World Food Program is warning about? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  To me, it's unbelievable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, how do you say concerned? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  I would hope that we're more than concerned. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=316.64s)]
*  We are sitting here supplying the Netanyahu government with the arms they need and in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=318.56s)]
*  the process of starving hundreds of thousands of children. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=325.0s)]
*  Is to modestly word, we have got to act and we've got to act now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=328.64s)]
*  What Merkley was talking about is not only is the bombing making it impossible for trucks, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, if you're a truck driver trying to deliver your goods, you're not going to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  do it when you get bombed. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=345.96s)]
*  But in addition to that, what Israel has done at the border has made it extremely difficult [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=347.32s)]
*  for these trucks to get through. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=355.52s)]
*  And bottom line here is we cannot turn our backs on the enormous, the enormity of the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=358.0s)]
*  suffering that is now taking place in Gaza. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=363.8s)]
*  We have got to act. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=366.4s)]
*  You are a Jewish-American. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=368.68s)]
*  You have family that was killed by Hitler. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=370.8s)]
*  You've talked about that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=374.36s)]
*  You're the closest, I think, any American Jewish candidate has ever come to the presidency [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=375.36s)]
*  or at least a nomination. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  And you were in Israel in a kibbutz in your youth. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=383.08s)]
*  This has been just a wrenching time, I think, for international and American Jews. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=387.56s)]
*  What do you feel and think as a Jew watching all this play out in these last hundred days? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=392.36s)]
*  Well, you know, Chris, what I would hope that no matter what my religious background is, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  I would respond accordingly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, if this was taking place in Italy or in Ireland, I would feel the same way. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  But I have to tell you, having spent months in Israel as a kid, knowing the history of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=413.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, for me to see a right-wing Israeli government create [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=419.52s)]
*  this kind of misery in Gaza is extraordinarily upsetting. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=427.6s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=433.08s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=434.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=436.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlCYNT7Z9I&t=443.32s)]
