# Hope Hicks ‘drops a bomb’ during Trump trial: ‘Nail in the coffin moment’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE)
*  Lydia Nutzie is a correspondent for New York Magazine where she has extensively covered Hope Hicks over the years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a great profile of her. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=4.76s)]
*  Christy Greenberg is a former deputy chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=6.04s)]
*  She was at the courthouse today and they both joined me now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=11.16s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=13.44s)]
*  Let me start with you because you were at the courthouse and you walked in and got on set and you were like, whoa, what a day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=15.0s)]
*  It felt again, we're reading this in real time from people that are in the room. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  We don't have cameras. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=23.44s)]
*  We don't have a transcript, but it felt that way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Just getting the little text dispatches. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=26.32s)]
*  What was it like in that in that building? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=28.36s)]
*  It was incredibly powerful testimony from Hope Hicks because before she even got to kind of the meat of it, she had said so many nice things about Donald Trump just to start. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=30.76s)]
*  You know, he's a master at branding. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=41.28s)]
*  He knows communications and like a lot of really kind of obsequious comments, you know, in showing that she still cares for the guy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=43.24s)]
*  So then when she starts making these statements that are damning to the defense's case, it has that much more power. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=51.56s)]
*  He she's not like the sleazeball lawyer who's got these sleazy tabloid clients or the tabloid journalist. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=58.84s)]
*  Like she's somebody who cared about him. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  And yet she is just, you know, there was the nail in the coffin moment where in 2018 there's a conversation that it's just her and Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=67.48s)]
*  He's the president of the United States at this point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=77.48s)]
*  Yes. She's working for him in the White House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes. And Michael Cohen says it has gone to the New York Times and said, out of the goodness of my heart, right, I made this payment to Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=80.88s)]
*  And Donald Trump says, well, you know, this would have been really damaging if it had come out during the campaign. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=88.96s)]
*  And it's good that it's coming out now and not then. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  And that was the last question from the prosecutor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=98.6s)]
*  And it was just a mic drop moment, like jaw dropping moment that she had said that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  So it was incredibly powerful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=107.32s)]
*  Just to follow up on that. And she started crying after she said that. Right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=109.84s)]
*  Like all this sort of tension in her gets released at that moment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=113.12s)]
*  Exactly. Like at that point, she the cross examination starts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  There's like a question or two about like, when did you start working at the Trump organization? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=120.4s)]
*  And that's when she starts crying. I don't at least watching it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=125.0s)]
*  It did not seem like that was the question that made her cry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  I think it was the fact that she had just she knew she dropped this bomb and that the weight of that really in that release, as you say, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=131.36s)]
*  you could just see it in in her expression. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Livia, you've covered Hopex for a long time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=142.88s)]
*  How central was she to the operation? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  How crucial a witness is she in this case? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=148.16s)]
*  She was in proximity and and in every other way, as close as you could get to that family without having the last name Trump, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  I think arguably she was much closer to Donald Trump than a lot of his own children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=158.24s)]
*  She was probably edges out Tiffany. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  Sam. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was a lot closer than than a lot of the children. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=166.92s)]
*  She was around all the time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  She started at the Trump organization and became very close to Ivanka and sort of built her reputation there in the family and then found herself. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  It's sort of this comical, almost like dark sitcom. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=179.56s)]
*  Donald Trump said we're going to Iowa. And she said, what do people wear in Iowa? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  She did not intend to work on a presidential campaign and did not intend to work in a White House. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=187.2s)]
*  It's not her dream. And yet she ended up there in this incredibly toxic, ultimately violent environment and saw a lot and has a near photographic memory, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=192.2s)]
*  even if that did not always come through in her testimony. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=202.72s)]
*  And I think it was probably very hard for Trump if he has emotions to see her in that position. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  She's not Michael Cohen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=211.92s)]
*  Yeah, there was a report. I mean, Lawrence said this when we played in the open. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  There was sort of avoidance of eye contact. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=216.2s)]
*  She said she hadn't talked to him since twenty twenty two. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=218.12s)]
*  It seems to me like there are two key parts of the prosecution's case that that Hicks helps the prosecution with. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  One is, was this about the campaign? Right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=230.16s)]
*  Because that's key to the motive. And the other was, was this being done by other people or did Trump have a role? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And my understanding is the testimony spoke to both of those. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=240.16s)]
*  But on the second you talked about the first one on the second one, like it's pretty clear from her testimony, at least, according to her, that he was involved. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=243.44s)]
*  This was not an off book operation freelance by Michael Cohen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=250.04s)]
*  Exactly right. And so she talks about the fact that when the inquiry first comes in, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  before the Wall Street Journal publishes that the National Enquirer is trying to squash this story about Karen McDougall, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=258.52s)]
*  when that inquiry first comes in, Donald Trump goes to Hope Hicks and says, what did David Pecker tell you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=265.8s)]
*  Right. And that's significant because he wants to make sure that David Pecker is sticking to the story. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=272.2s)]
*  This was a legitimate business contract with Karen McDougall. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=276.88s)]
*  We wanted her on the magazine cover. Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=279.36s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that, you know, that he wanted to make sure that the contract, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=281.44s)]
*  which just says that this was a legitimate business opportunity, promotional opportunity, that Pecker was telling that story. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=285.68s)]
*  But this Hope Hicks is in the dark. And then after the article is published, this is the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=291.36s)]
*  After it's published, this is now a few days before the election, November 4th, 2016. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=298.24s)]
*  After the article is published, what does Donald Trump say to Hope Hicks? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=303.2s)]
*  And that's what he would say whenever he wanted to find out how something was being received in the press, again, related to the election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=308.12s)]
*  Now, she also testified, as you mentioned in the opening, that, you know, he said maybe make sure the newspaper doesn't go to Melania. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's also fine. Like, you can have both purposes so long as the campaign is front and center, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  which it clearly was and which Hope Hicks testified that it was. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=326.68s)]
*  But again, like, his focus was also on getting David Pecker's phone number after the article came out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=330.04s)]
*  He asked Hope Hicks, give me Pecker's phone number, and then afterwards says, it's all good. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=336.52s)]
*  Like, we talked. It's all fine. Right. So he's good, which is what Pecker testified. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  How's our girl? Again, yes. This corroboration of what we've already heard from Pecker, again, showing Donald Trump is right in the center of this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  And Hicks, part of what was fascinating to me again, as I was sort of reading this through our internal Slack channel, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=356.44s)]
*  is that again, it was a reminder of the sheer chaos and crisis and almost tipping point moment of the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=363.4s)]
*  And the fact that that article that does come out before the election ultimately ends up spaced out enough. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=370.2s)]
*  That it would like if if that had come out the day after Planet Access Hollywood or two days after or three days like that could have been it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=377.24s)]
*  Right. I mean, you were there covering it. That could have been lucky. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=385.64s)]
*  Yeah, they got sort of lucky with the timing of that. And also remember at that time, it's easy to forget now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=388.28s)]
*  I think I've repressed a lot of it. I think most Americans have. It was one allegation after another. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=393.08s)]
*  It was more than two dozen allegations in the end of some sort of sexual misconduct or impropriety. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=397.56s)]
*  And it was just one thing after another. They're running against Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=403.24s)]
*  It's not like they think that they're going to do well with women voters overall. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=406.84s)]
*  But it's just this sort of torrent of negative information. And this is yet another thing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you about the moment when Hope Hicks cried. I understand you've been doing some reporting about that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=415.64s)]
*  I mean, my understanding was, look, she did not want to testify. She was compelled to testify. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=421.64s)]
*  It's not as though she raised her hand and said, yes, I want to help ruin Donald Trump's life. Right. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=425.32s)]
*  This is someone who's been very important to her, even if she does maintain very complicated, conflicted feelings about him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=429.8s)]
*  And my understanding was that being asked about the opportunities that he had given her in her life sort of brought all of that back and made her very emotional. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=436.52s)]
*  That it was not a direct response to the real. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  Because that's how the that's how the cross started. Yes. Which is sort of a kind of like twisting the knife. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=448.2s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Like this guy that gave you everything you're up here testifying. Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjE9nz29NE&t=452.59999999999997s)]
