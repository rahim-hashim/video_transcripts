# Trump endorses coup supporter Jim Jordan for House speaker
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI)
*  When last we left the House Republican caucus, they were flirting openly with the idea of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=0.0s)]
*  anointing Donald Trump as their speaker, as Speaker of the House for the entire United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=6.08s)]
*  This is the man, of course, who sick to mob on that same Capitol building in an attempt to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=10.96s)]
*  violently topple the duly elected government, a man who has since been indicted on 91 criminal [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=15.84s)]
*  counts, including for those events across four jurisdictions. They were actively talking about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=21.28s)]
*  choosing him to lead the United States House of Representatives to make him second in line to the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=28.24s)]
*  presidency. That is until about 930 last night when Republican Congressman Troy Nels of Texas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=32.8s)]
*  announced that he, quote, just had a great conversation with President Trump about the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=38.56s)]
*  Speaker's race and he is endorsing Jim Jordan, the Congressman from Ohio. The ex-president himself [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=42.4s)]
*  followed it up with a middle of the night post confirming he does indeed think that Jordan will [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=48.64s)]
*  be a great Speaker of the House and has his complete and total endorsement. God, that's a long post. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=52.16s)]
*  Now, to a very small degree, tiny sliver. I'll take what I could get these days. This is something of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=58.64s)]
*  a relief, honestly, because I think Donald Trump as Speaker of the House would be an awful and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=63.52s)]
*  dangerous situation. But the potential speakership of Jim Jordan, far right member of the House [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=68.08s)]
*  Freedom Caucus, a loyal Trump ally, solves absolutely nothing. And in fact, it represents [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=74.16s)]
*  everything that is wrong with the Republican Party. I mean, Jim Jordan is the member of Congress who [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=81.2s)]
*  was arguably most involved in Donald Trump's coup. Earlier this week, January 6th Committee [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=86.48s)]
*  Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney laid this out for us again in a speech. Jim Jordan knew more [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6th than any other member of the House of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Representatives. Jim Jordan was involved, was part of the conspiracy in which Donald Trump was engaged [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=110.48s)]
*  as he attempted to overturn the election. And if the Republicans decide that Jim Jordan should be [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=120.64s)]
*  the Speaker of the House, there will, and I, by the way, I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=128.0s)]
*  I think he'll lose. But if they were to decide that, there would no longer be any possible way [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=133.92s)]
*  to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Remember, Liz Cheney and the January 6th Committee subpoenaed Jim Jordan. They wanted to know more [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  about what he did know, what he did in the run-up to January 6th, and he just flat out ignored it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=155.04s)]
*  So he never got the truth from a man who they believed to be a key witness in the investigation, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=159.76s)]
*  as Vice Chair Cheney said at the time. I think that Congressman Jordan may well be a material [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=164.48s)]
*  witness. He's somebody who was involved in a number of meetings in the lead-up to what happened on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=171.76s)]
*  January 6th, involved in planning for January 6th, certainly for the objections that day, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=178.48s)]
*  as he said publicly. So he may well be a material witness. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=184.08s)]
*  Jim Jordan is also one of the Republican lawmakers who returned to the House chamber [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  after they were all escorted out, right, into safe spaces, literally, and after the violent [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  sacking of the Capitol, when they came back in, who then voted in favor of Donald Trump's coup. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  And just five days later, Trump rewarded his loyal foot soldier with the Medal of Freedom. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  So Jim Jordan is one of the most MAGA-devoted members of the caucus, the same group of people [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=211.84s)]
*  that produced the very situation we are in now, with a destructive, ungovernable Republican [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  majority in the House. In the words of former Speaker John Boehner, he is a political terrorist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  You call some of these members political terrorists. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, Jim Jordan especially, my colleague from Ohio. I just never saw a guy who spent more time [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=233.04s)]
*  tearing things apart and never building anything, never putting anything together. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  One of the ways Jim Jordan tears things apart is by fanning the flames of discord on Fox News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Jordan has made no less than, and this is an accurate number as far as we can tell, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=253.12s)]
*  565 appearances on Fox in a little over six years. And that's just on weekdays, okay? He might as [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=257.28s)]
*  well have his own weekly program. In fact, Jordan has made more appearances on Fox than any other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=263.84s)]
*  sitting member of Congress since media matters began counting back in 2017. By comparison, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=268.64s)]
*  his main competitor for Speaker Steve Spillis of Louisiana has been on less than 300 times. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=274.4s)]
*  All of which is to say, a Jim Jordan speakership would be a near worst-case scenario. He is a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=280.16s)]
*  destructive force, a political terrorist. In the words of a colleague, John Boehner, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=287.36s)]
*  a guy who is willing to destroy American democracy for Donald Trump, anyone who endorses [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=294.08s)]
*  Jordan and any member who votes for him is affirmatively voting for a coup plotter, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=298.48s)]
*  an election denier, and a foe of American democracy. And that is especially true [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  for the 18 House Republicans representing districts that were carried by Joe Biden. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=308.72s)]
*  People like David Schweikart in Arizona, Mike Garcia and Young Kim in California, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=313.68s)]
*  Nick La Lota, George Santos. Remember that guy? Mike Lawler, Mark Molinara, all in New York. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=319.12s)]
*  All those people you see up on their screen, are they going to vote for Jim Jordan? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=325.2s)]
*  A vote for Jordan from any of them, from any Republican, but especially from these [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=330.4s)]
*  vulnerable members, is a vote for a MAGA extremist. It is a proxy vote for Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump's anointed him. Heck, it's a vote for Donald Trump and Matt Gaetz, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=340.48s)]
*  who have both endorsed him. It's not clear if the Republican Party understands the problem they have. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=344.0s)]
*  In a crystal clear example of their total oblivion, earlier today, this is too good, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=349.6s)]
*  I can't believe this, we learned the candidates for speaker, we're going to have a debate on Fox [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  News on television. Now, keep in mind, Fox and the right-wing media ecosystem is largely [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=360.08s)]
*  responsible for the current state of the Republican Party. They have produced a movement so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=368.4s)]
*  obsessively focused on trolling and attention that it has no governing vision. It's essentially a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  media production. A Fox News debate for speaker was kind of a perfect idea in that respect, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=380.08s)]
*  but a terrible idea on the merits. Such a terrible idea, it sparked an immediate backlash, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  even from within the House Republican caucus. One moderate House Republican told Axios, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=392.0s)]
*  quote, it's the height of idiocy. A few hours later, both Jim Jordan and Skeves [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  released back down, Fox had to delete the press release from their website. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=402.0s)]
*  But debate or no debate, the Republican caucus still has all of the same problems [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=407.12s)]
*  they had when they deposed Kevin McCarthy. The same problems they had when they elected Kevin McCarthy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=411.44s)]
*  The hard right, burn it all down base, is not going anywhere. The party is still run by [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=419.2s)]
*  Donald Trump, a uniquely malevolent, dangerous force in American politics who wants to end [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=424.8s)]
*  the constitutional republic as we know it. None of that has been solved. None of it will be solved [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=430.48s)]
*  by Speaker Jordan or Speaker Scalise if either of them could get enough votes to win the gavel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=436.16s)]
*  Republicans going to have to elect someone to run one of the two houses of the United [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=442.8s)]
*  States Congress and keep the government functioning. We'll just have to wait and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=446.48s)]
*  see because frankly, I have no idea what happens next. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDjlp3DL3hI&t=450.08000000000004s)]
