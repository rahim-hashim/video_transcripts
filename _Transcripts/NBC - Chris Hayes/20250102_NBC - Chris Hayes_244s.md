# ‘Dangerous’: Trump and MAGA falsely link New Orleans attack to the border
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc)
*  I think we've all come to expect, sadly, that in the midst of some disaster or some terrible attack, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump will be chomping at the bit to unleash lies and the worst kind of bigotry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=5.2s)]
*  And we saw this before in Trump's first term. First as farce, when he famously drew in Sharpie [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=9.76s)]
*  on a hurricane map to make it look like his erroneous warning about where the hurricane [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=15.76s)]
*  would hit was actually correct. Remember that one? And then as tragedy, when in the midst of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=21.44s)]
*  his disastrous response to a once in a lifetime pandemic that killed over a million Americans, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=26.0s)]
*  Trump regularly pushed untested treatments like ivermectin that almost certainly cost many, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=30.96s)]
*  many American lives. What leaders do during moments like this actually matter a lot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=36.64s)]
*  Genuine, tangible effects that can be for the good or can really hurt people. And so yesterday, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=43.92s)]
*  within hours of the attack in New Orleans, we didn't know much, right? President-elect [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=49.36s)]
*  Donald Trump falsely suggested the suspect was an undocumented immigrant or someone who had crossed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=53.6s)]
*  over the border in some way. He was not. In fact, officials later identified the suspect as an [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=58.88s)]
*  American Army veteran born and raised in the U.S. of A. But it was all very predictable, enraging, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=64.64s)]
*  and dangerous. And even after we found out that this was an American, today Republicans continued, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  even though both the attacker in New Orleans and the Cybertruck driver in Las Vegas were not immigrants. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=76.88s)]
*  The congressional Republicans, we here in the House and the Senate, have repeatedly asked the DHS [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=81.68s)]
*  under the Biden administration about the correlation, the obvious concern about terrorism and the wide [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=88.48s)]
*  open border, the idea that dangerous people were coming here in droves and setting up potentially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=93.92s)]
*  terrorist cells around the country. I can't emphasize enough, close the border, secure our [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  sovereignty, you know, and that is completely unacceptable. The entire world knows that we have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=104.88s)]
*  an open border. They intend to hit us and they are pushing people into our interior to do just that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=114.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The guy was from Houston. Close the border so that Houston ends [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=120.64s)]
*  up on the other side of the border? How's that work? That immediate knee-jerk reaction is really [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=126.32s)]
*  everywhere you look down the Republican Bar. It doesn't matter that it was belied by the facts, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=133.36s)]
*  they just kept going with it. And it's bad. I mean, today a Florida state senator, a guy named [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Randy Fine, a guy who Trump has endorsed in a special election for Congress, called the New [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=142.96s)]
*  Orleans attack Muslim terror, and this is, I think, notable, part of a worldwide hashtag Muslim problem, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  a phrase that, deliberately or not, echoes the Nazi rhetoric about a Jewish problem. And of course, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=156.4s)]
*  Trump is posting more of his own vile, declaring today our country is a disaster, that violent [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=162.96s)]
*  scum has infiltrated all aspects of our government and our nation itself. And at some level, I think, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  I guess for better or for worse, I'm not quite sure. Most people have just come to price this all in, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=175.12s)]
*  Trump is going to say reckless, irresponsible, offensive, and untrue things. That's just Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=179.28s)]
*  But again, all this is actually really high stakes. And when you're president, it can be really very [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  dangerous. And in just 18 days, Trump is going to be sworn in again. And we do not know what [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=192.08s)]
*  dangers might lie in the future. But I'll tell you, it absolutely sends a chill up my spine [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  to imagine what his response will be if we have the misfortune of having another major crisis, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=205.28s)]
*  like another pandemic or financial panic or massive terrorist attack. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=209.68s)]
*  We can ignore what he says, sure, but many, many people are going to be listening. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e99AzVYlIwc&t=222.08s)]
