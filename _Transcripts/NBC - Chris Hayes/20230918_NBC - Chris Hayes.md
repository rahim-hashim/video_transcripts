# Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones defend Russell Brand over sexual assault allegations
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Tonight we are awaiting a ruling from federal judge Tonya [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Chutkin in DC on whether or not she will recuse herself from Donald Trump's federal election case. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=4.28s)]
*  And that request, made by the ex-president's lawyers, comes because they say she is biased. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=10.28s)]
*  Their argument centers on the fact that Judge Chutkin mentioned during previous trials of January 6th [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  defendants that Donald Trump remained free. Indisputably true. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=21.64s)]
*  Now that motion that we're expecting is just one of many moving pieces and of course the many legal battles [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=25.68s)]
*  that the four times indicted ex-presidents facing. It's easy to lose track of them all, even for me, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=32.08s)]
*  who follows it professionally. But remember, this is a man who is facing four impending criminal trials [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=37.68s)]
*  across four different jurisdictions with a total of more than 90 charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=42.16s)]
*  It's a man who's already been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming a woman named E. Jean Carroll, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  who says that he raped her in a dressing room and ordered to pay her $5 million in a civil trial earlier this year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=51.4s)]
*  In a few months, he will be back in court for another defamation suit brought by Carroll. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=59.16s)]
*  And yet, again, you know this, Donald Trump is polling above 55% in the Republican primary, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=64.12s)]
*  according to the 538 polling average. His closest challenger, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has fallen to 14%. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=69.52s)]
*  There is a total disconnect between the reality of who Donald Trump is and what he has done, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  what he's done on camera that we've seen, the crimes for which he has been accused, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=81.88s)]
*  and the enduring support he has among a large swath of our fellow citizens inside the Republican Party. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=86.28s)]
*  Now, of course, again, I'm not saying anything new here. The dynamic certainly isn't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=93.2s)]
*  It's the fundamental tension, the central tension we've been dealing with for the past eight years. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=97.32s)]
*  And I think we can see the root of that dynamic, how it plays out in the right, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=103.2s)]
*  in a news story that broke over the weekend involving a figure other than Donald Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  This man, British comedian Russell Brand, who you probably recognize. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=112.08s)]
*  You may know him from his stand-up career or roles in several Hollywood films. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=115.28s)]
*  He's undoubtedly a very charismatic performer. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=119.24s)]
*  And recently, he's taken a sort of interesting career turn. He's become a popular, very popular podcaster. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=122.12s)]
*  He bills himself as kind of a wellness guru, but actually promotes a lot of bogus ideas about everything from vaccines to climate change. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=127.56s)]
*  And his whole shtick is part of this booming, enormous corner of the Internet. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=136.16s)]
*  I wouldn't even call it a corner anymore. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=140.6s)]
*  Occupied by people, audiences of people who are skeptical about institutions in general, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=142.8s)]
*  often with very good reason, the government and big pharma or globalists, as they call them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=149.72s)]
*  And the appeal of Russell Brand's particular shtick, although again, a lot of other people are sort of in this game, is a fundamental issue of trust. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=155.44s)]
*  You've got a lot of people out there across the world, different countries, the UK, here, a lot of places. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=165.16s)]
*  You have people who are distrustful of traditional sources of knowledge or authority, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=170.4s)]
*  and then figures like Russell Brand or Donald Trump using that distrust to their advantage. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=175.04s)]
*  And they tell their audience, you're right, all those other people are lying to you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=181.32s)]
*  They can't be trusted. They're corrupt, rigged. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=184.76s)]
*  I am the one to tell you the truth. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=188.48s)]
*  I'm the only one to tell you the truth. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=190.48s)]
*  I am the only one you can trust. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=192.76s)]
*  It's me. And that's it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=195.16s)]
*  They cultivate that distrust to remove any connection their audience has to other sources of information. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=198.32s)]
*  That could be the so-called mainstream media or the establishment or the deep state or whatever derogatory term they come up with next. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  The bureaucrats of the Federal Food and Drug Administration. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=212.44s)]
*  The result of this process, it's playing out day by day in front of us, is huge groups of citizens. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, millions and millions of people were so deeply entrenched in this distrust, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=222.72s)]
*  they're essentially unreachable from those traditional sources of authority. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  They are trapped in this bubble of skepticism and conspiracy theories. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=231.12s)]
*  And there's no obvious way to pierce it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=236.0s)]
*  We've seen this happen with the Trump faction in American politics. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=239.84s)]
*  We talked about it a lot with regards to the cult of Fox News convincing you the viewers they're the only real news source to trust. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=243.44s)]
*  Their whole marketing thing is those other folks lie to you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=250.16s)]
*  We tell you the truth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=252.84s)]
*  And then when they had the viewers in the palm of their hands spreading lies about fraud after the 2020 election for which they had to pay like 900 million dollars, give or take. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=254.24s)]
*  Donald Trump uses the same dynamic to his own benefit all the time, right? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=265.76s)]
*  Just repeating wild allegations about his prosecutions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=270.0s)]
*  He knows his audience has been conditioned to believe them. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=273.0s)]
*  This one is part of his regular stump speech now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=276.64s)]
*  They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=285.48s)]
*  They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=288.24s)]
*  In the end, they're not after me. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=293.44s)]
*  They're after you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=295.56s)]
*  And I just happen to be standing in their way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=296.52s)]
*  I mean, there's something sort of facially preposterous about it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=301.28s)]
*  Like they're prosecuting him for the documents he appears to have stolen from the government to get to who he's standing in their way so that he could like stack his boxes in his bathroom in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=304.64s)]
*  He was doing that for us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=316.76s)]
*  But it works. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=319.04s)]
*  It works, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=319.96s)]
*  If they're prosecuting me, they remember the big they the capital T they it's because they were untrustworthy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=321.2s)]
*  Are mad at me for telling the truth about them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=330.0s)]
*  And we're seeing another example of this in the wake of these allegations against Russell Brand allegations of rape, of sexual assault, allegations of abuse. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=333.36s)]
*  The findings come from a joint investigation by three UK news outlets, the Sunday Times, the Times and Channel 4 Dispatches. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=344.8s)]
*  They spoke with four women who have alleged sexual assaults between 2006 and 2013, including one who is just 16 years old when she says Brand began a relationship with her. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=352.08s)]
*  That was the age of consent in the UK at the time, I should note. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=362.48s)]
*  She recounts how he would send a car to her school to take her out of lessons to his home. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, when given a chance to reply to these allegations, Brand's lawyers told those news outlets that their client believes there is a, quote, deeply concerning agenda. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=372.72s)]
*  All this namely the fact that he is an alternative media broadcaster competing with the mainstream media and then brand himself released a video statement saying his relationships were, quote, always consensual, that he absolutely refutes the allegations. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  And he went on to allege there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kinds of spaces that he occupies and accuses the mainstream media of a coordinated attack. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=393.88s)]
*  Now, let me just say I didn't report this story. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=404.2s)]
*  We haven't confirmed it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=407.24s)]
*  I don't know whether these allegations are true. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=408.6s)]
*  I can only consider the evidence presented in the published investigation, and I would suggest people read it because it's pretty harrowing stuff. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  That said, I do find it difficult to believe that Russell Brand has been targeted because of his brave truth telling on the war in Ukraine or his vaccine skepticism. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=420.48s)]
*  And yet that line of defense is a very persuasive one, not just for his audience, but for the whole gamut of folks who are enmeshed in this lucrative, hemetically sealed universe of distrust and disinformation. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=431.92s)]
*  And a lot of them, shocker, are expressing their solidarity with Russell Brand. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=446.4s)]
*  Fired cable news host Tucker Carlson wrote, criticize the drug companies, question the war in Ukraine, and you can be pretty sure this is going to happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  Far-right conspiracy theorist Alec Jones echoed that claim, saying the allegations suddenly appeared after Brand came out against the New World Order. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  And right-wing influencer, self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate, who you may know was recently charged with rape and human trafficking, called the allegations against Brand a, quote, matrix attack. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=467.64s)]
*  Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro called the timing suspicious, saying that Brand was being targeted for political views. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=481.56s)]
*  Even the owner of X, Elon Musk, declared his support, writing, quote, that man is not evil. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=486.96s)]
*  It's like a perfect who's who list. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=494.12s)]
*  It's exactly who you would think. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=496.44s)]
*  It's exactly the people doing the same thing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=498.28s)]
*  All of these people who are all just a single node in a network away from Donald Trump function within the same ecosystem that combines extreme skepticism, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=503.52s)]
*  bordering on nihilism for institutions like the law or the media with just total gullibility towards the supposed anti-establishment truth tellers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=513.24s)]
*  I mean, why would Russell Brand lie? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  Why would Andrew Tate lie? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=527.4s)]
*  They seem trustworthy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a complete inversion. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  And how you get real information to the folks that trust them without them just dismissing it on the hand, it's literally the fundamental problem for American democracy at a moment where its future is really very much in doubt. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPwXv_wrQ&t=534.28s)]
