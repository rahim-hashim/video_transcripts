# ‘Too lame to lead’: GOP candidates launch attack ads in final weeks before Iowa
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA)
*  We are less than two weeks away from the Iowa caucuses and three weeks from New Hampshire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=0.0s)]
*  primaries, which together kick off the 2024 presidential cycle in earnest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=5.54s)]
*  New polling shows Nikki Haley on the rise, breaking into double digits nationally and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=11.02s)]
*  rocketing up in New Hampshire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=15.3s)]
*  You can see the pink line jumping within striking distance of Donald Trump, clearly an alarming [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  development for Trump's camp. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  The ex-president has taken to insulting Haley, calling her bird brain. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=23.96s)]
*  Nikki Haley is taking shots at DeSantis and Chris Christie is pretty much going after [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=28.82s)]
*  everybody. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=32.46s)]
*  Nikki Haley promised. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=33.46s)]
*  I will not, not now, not ever support raising the gas tanks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=36.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  Not now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Not ever? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is lying because he's losing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  DeSantis called China Florida's most important trading partner. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  DeSantis even allowed a Chinese military contractor to expand just miles from a U.S. naval base [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  Only Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=58.78s)]
*  Too lame to leave, too weak to win. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=60.78s)]
*  He caused a riot on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  He'll burn America to the ground to help himself. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  Every Republican leader says that in private. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=68.54s)]
*  I'm the only one saying it in public. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=71.14s)]
*  What kind of president do we want? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=73.78s)]
*  A liar or someone who's got the guts to tell the truth? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=75.38s)]
*  New Hampshire, it's up to you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=78.66s)]
*  Brendan Buck is a Republican strategist who served as press secretary of vice presidential [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  nominee Paul Ryan in 2012. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=87.74s)]
*  Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=90.08s)]
*  They join me now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=93.24s)]
*  I'll start with you, Brendan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=97.12s)]
*  This is what's interesting to me when I'm looking at these numbers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=98.92s)]
*  I see Nikki Haley improving. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=102.88s)]
*  I see Chris Christie continuing to take shots at everybody. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=104.88s)]
*  I see Ron DeSantis sort of fading. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=108.64s)]
*  Is all of this just sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=111.08s)]
*  Is there any chance, not just that somebody beats Donald Trump for the nomination, do [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=115.02s)]
*  you think there's any chance that he doesn't just sweep all the primaries? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  I think it's a very good bet that he's going to sweep all the primaries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=123.14s)]
*  I'll let Jennifer talk about New Hampshire. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  But it is notable that Nikki Haley is close. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=130.78s)]
*  That is the closest we've seen anybody. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=133.78s)]
*  Now is that enough to win? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=135.66s)]
*  No. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=137.06s)]
*  But I do think that it is, we need to remember that Nikki Haley's rise here has gone with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=138.06s)]
*  Donald Trump largely ignoring her. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=143.42s)]
*  And it seems that he's no longer going to be doing that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=146.54s)]
*  And I think we need to appreciate that Donald Trump is more than capable of knocking out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  Nikki Haley in the same way that he did to Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=152.94s)]
*  I mean, Ron DeSantis was pretty close, if not ahead of Donald Trump in some polls at [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=155.9s)]
*  the beginning of this year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=161.7s)]
*  And his slip was two things. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=163.46s)]
*  One, it was just he proved to be a bad candidate. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=165.26s)]
*  But the second was Donald Trump came out pummeling Ron DeSantis and DeSantis didn't know how to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=167.8s)]
*  respond. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=171.74s)]
*  So if Donald Trump turns on Nikki Haley now and really starts taking shots at her, I think [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=172.78s)]
*  he'll be able to very easily clear that and this primary will be over very, very quickly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  Jennifer, I have to ask you, as former head of the party in New Hampshire, sometimes New [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=182.74s)]
*  Hampshire voters, they like to be contrarian. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=187.34s)]
*  Sometimes they see what happens in Iowa and they're like, well, you know what, I want to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  do something different just to keep this spicy and interesting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=194.02s)]
*  Do you think that that is a possibility? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you think if Donald Trump just just basically runs circles around everybody in Iowa, that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=199.38s)]
*  New Hampshire Republican voters may say, hold on, we're going to put our support behind [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=205.62s)]
*  Nikki Haley or Chris Christie? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=209.66s)]
*  Or do you think that a successful caucus for Donald Trump and Iowa will pretty much mean [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=211.46s)]
*  that everybody will get in line in New Hampshire? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=216.42s)]
*  I don't see that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=219.62s)]
*  And I would take charge, I think, with the idea of New Hampshire voters exactly being [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=222.18s)]
*  contrarian, but more more independent thinking is how I used to used to think of us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=227.06s)]
*  But what I what I see in New Hampshire, honestly, is that Donald Trump's support has been deep [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=234.18s)]
*  and broad both and that it has been consistent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=238.9s)]
*  And while Nikki Haley has been able to sort of creep up closer and closer, remember that that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=243.06s)]
*  really happened and supported in great part by the spending millions and millions of dollars of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  spending by Americans for prosperity over the last month. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=255.3s)]
*  And now that she is getting closer, you know, as to the previous point, Trump has the ability [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=258.58s)]
*  to just crush her if he wants to in New Hampshire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=264.42s)]
*  I think, you know, the the bet them, I think somebody just referenced that she was within [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  striking, you know, within striking distance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=273.62s)]
*  I don't necessarily really agree with that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=276.26s)]
*  I don't think she's quite there yet. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=278.02s)]
*  If she gets down within single digits, then she's within striking distance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  But I think Donald Trump has himself perfectly positioned still in spite of her rise. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=284.34s)]
*  I think he's going to win New Hampshire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=289.94s)]
*  I think he's going to continue to win after that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  And then what I really think is the interesting question, you know, is going to be at what point [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=295.06s)]
*  does the RNC step in and publicly suggest that everybody else should get out of the way? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  I think that they will eventually come in and ask Nikki Haley to step aside. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, Brendan, cynically, you know, in previous election seasons, 2012, you know, 2016, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=311.86s)]
*  where they're usually somebody who's a really, really strong candidate, a lot of times, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  political commentators, analysts will say, well, you know what, these people are just running for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=322.5s)]
*  vice president, given how Donald Trump treated his last vice president and his supporters [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=325.94s)]
*  threatened his last vice president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=331.46s)]
*  Do you think there is anyone in the current Republican field who has that delusion? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=333.14s)]
*  Who has that delusion? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=338.5s)]
*  Is Nikki Haley thinking to herself, well, you know what, I might miss the moon, but I'll be amongst [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=339.7s)]
*  the stars. Donald Trump will pick me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=344.74s)]
*  I know Chris Christie couldn't have that idea. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=346.26s)]
*  Are there any Republicans now who think that that's their opportunity or are they still [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=348.34s)]
*  really running because they either think that Trump will stumble or maybe they'll have a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=352.58s)]
*  chance to raise some more money? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=356.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think at this point, you know, Nikki Haley and Rhonda Sanchez, the two more serious [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=358.82s)]
*  people are really just running to save face. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=362.5s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley is hoping that she can have a strong second. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=365.14s)]
*  And if Donald Trump loses in a general election, she is potentially still viable and kind of say, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=368.26s)]
*  I told you so. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=372.9s)]
*  I think Rhonda Sanchez is trying to salvage something of his future. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=373.86s)]
*  I mean, the shine has completely come off of Rhonda Sanchez. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=378.58s)]
*  And if he comes in third in Iowa after spending so much time there, it has to basically drop out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=381.38s)]
*  in shame. His future may be done. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=387.46s)]
*  I think he sees himself as, if not this time, I still need to be able to run in the future. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=389.54s)]
*  I'm sure Nikki Haley the same. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=394.58s)]
*  So they're trying to save their future, I think, at this point more than anything. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=395.86s)]
*  Jennifer, very quickly, we've talked about this earlier in the show. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=400.9s)]
*  There is just a litany of court cases that Donald Trump is going to have to face heading [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=404.18s)]
*  into primary season. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=409.94s)]
*  Do you think that has any impact at all, that there may actually be some super Tuesday states [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=411.3s)]
*  that he doesn't necessarily have as much time to campaign in because he's going to be in court? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=415.86s)]
*  Will that make any difference one way or another? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=420.18s)]
*  I really don't think it will in the end. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=421.78s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't need to campaign in person the way all the other candidates do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=424.5s)]
*  And we've seen time after time after time that the more the more the more he the more indictments he [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=428.58s)]
*  faces, the more legal trouble he faces, the deeper that his support grows in most amongst [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=435.38s)]
*  most Republican voters. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  They believe that Donald Trump is a symbol for themselves and their party, that he's being [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=444.17999999999995s)]
*  attacked is somehow an attack on them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=449.62s)]
*  And as long as yes, I really don't think it's going to impact the outcome of this race. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597sVMZmIdA&t=453.7s)]
