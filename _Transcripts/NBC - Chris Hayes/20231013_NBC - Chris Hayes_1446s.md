# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We have some breaking news. We of course following developments in the Israel Hamas war, but breaking news in the U.S. Capitol. Steve Scalise, the man elected by the Republican caucus to be the next speaker, but who was short of the votes to do so, has just announced apparently inside the Republican conference that he's withdrawing his name from the speakership. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't know why other than the whip count vote against him within the Republican caucus today had ballooned to 16 or 17 votes or people saying that he could not get to the 217 needed to be elected speaker of the House. Of course, this comes a week after Kevin McCarthy was deposed by a far right MAGA caucus, which initiated a motion to vacate the chair that was successful with eight members voting aye along with all the Democrats. There's been a speaker pro temp, Patrick McCarthy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=23.0s)]
*  Since then, serving in a kind of custodial fashion, this is all totally unprecedented in American history. We haven't had this before. It's 100 years since we had a motion to vacate the chair amidst a unfolding global crisis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=53.0s)]
*  The second in line to the president and constitutional office of speaker of the House remains vacant with no clear path for this House Republican caucus to rally behind anyone for an election. I believe we have Ali Vitali joining us now to fill us in. Ali, I literally just learned about this before we went to air. What is going on? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=69.0s)]
*  Chris, I literally just learned about it before you went to air. This is all happening in pretty much real time here. We were confused when Republicans said that they were going to notice a 7 30 meeting. There was no real reason why they would do that. It wasn't clear that Scalise had moved any of the members that said they would never vote for him. It turns out that on his way into the meeting, he said he was going to have more conversations. We're going to hear what those conversations were, but it turns out that in the room he said he was dropping his vote against the president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=89.0s)]
*  He was dropping his bid for speaker, aware of the fact that he was going to be shy of the 217 votes that he needed. What's important here is on the one hand, it's back to the drawing board for the rest of the Republican conference now because they have to go back likely behind closed doors, do another kind of secret speaker election, see if they can't get consensus at that point, and then try to bring it back to a more public floor vote. We never even hit that phase with Scalise, but there are still going to be people who are jockeying for this, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=119.0s)]
*  including the man who was Scalise's official challenger in this round of the speaker's race, Congressman Jim Jordan. He's someone who had thrown his support behind Scalise, but he never lost support from some diehards within this conference. I do have to say, though, I don't think it matters who the person is. They are all going to have an immensely difficult road getting to the magic number that they need to actually become speaker. In my conversations with members earlier today when they did about three hours of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=149.0s)]
*  basically an airing of grievances behind closed doors, some of them apparently in that meeting even joked that they don't even think Jesus could get 217 votes in this conference. As much as that's hyperbole and it's a punchline, I'm actually not sure that they're wrong because it is an immensely difficult conference to herd these cats within. Every single vote counts. Every individual's concern or question counts, and that's what makes this so difficult. It's why Kevin McCarthy had such a hard time back in January. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=179.0s)]
*  I think that when you when you have four votes to spare in the caucus, right, and you're expecting a party line vote because you're elected by the entire House, you may get six or seven people who are knows right who have mutually exclusive asks. I mean, this is a thing that was unfolding with me is that it's one thing that there's a block that says we're a hard no, and we want these three things. If you've got six or seven or eight or 17 in the case, the last whip count that NBC, I think you, Ali, and you're reporting and produced about the Scalise no votes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=209.0s)]
*  And the fact that you're going to vote for the people over the map is not even like there's a negotiation you can do exactly. It's not like you're going conference by conference caucus by caucus and saying, okay, the moderates want X the Freedom Caucus folks want. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=239.0s)]
*  Why? How do we put those things together? No Scalise and whoever comes after have gone literally individual member by individual member. Not only is that immensely inefficient, but it also means that some of these asks are going to come in direct clash with each other, and you can't appease everyone. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=253.0s)]
*  You can't figure out are you appeasing enough people to lose the people that you can't get on board. It's a true balancing act, and it's one that frankly again, most of the members that I've been in touch with for the last two weeks or so up through the motion to vacate and even now as they try to pick who comes next. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=268.0s)]
*  There is not a clear consensus within this conference. Even when Matt Gates was threatening, I'm going to do a motion to vacate. The open question we had was, okay, if not McCarthy, then who? There was no clean answer then, and there's no clean answer now. And I know that for some Americans, this might seem inside baseball or not important to their life. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=285.0s)]
*  But when you look at the larger geopolitical landscape right now, this is at the core of the way the House functions. Yes, it's in the line of succession for the presidency. You mentioned that, but it's also the way that they can do as little as condemn Hamas for what happened in Israel and at most of sending military and humanitarian aid to Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=304.0s)]
*  Those are key priorities here, but they are effectively unable to do any governing whatsoever because they cannot decide who the Speaker of the House is going to be. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=324.0s)]
*  It's an important point there. I will note that of course, speakership elections happen in the entire House. In other state houses, sometimes there's been deals cut to get to someone consensus drawing across party lines that I don't think anyone wants to do that now, but I [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=334.0s)]
*  imagine there might be some conversations along those lines the longer this goes. There does have to be a speaker soon because the business of governing has to happen. Ali Patali, who is on this story, rushed to a camera at the last minute. Thank you very much for doing that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=350.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=364.0s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker is a Democrat of New Jersey who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee. Last Saturday, he was in Israel when the Hamas attacks began. This is his first interview since returning to the United States. He joins me now. It's great to have you here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=366.0s)]
*  Good to be here with you in person again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=378.0s)]
*  Well, let me just start because you just learned as I did that Steve Scalise has withdrawn, which, you know, it's not your house, but it's all of ours in the sense that it's the United States House of Representatives. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=380.0s)]
*  To the point that Michael McCall, the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, made, it also means that certain things can't be done over there. What is your reaction to that? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=391.0s)]
*  This is a problem. We are in crisis right now in the country and we have important issues we should be dealing with. Resolutely supporting the effort in Ukraine, resolutely standing with Israel, helping to aid in their defense and the protection of citizens and the evacuation of Americans from Gaza to Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=399.0s)]
*  There are many important issues, not to mention funding the government. So to have this level of dysfunction amongst the House Republicans and especially a number of small group of right wing folks who are undermining the functioning of government, this is very problematic at a terrible time going on in our world right now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=419.0s)]
*  You were in Israel on that Saturday on Shemkat Torah when the Hamas massacre happened in the south. You were also in the region, I believe, after that, if not mistaken. What is your takeaway back here, having been in the region at this moment of such awful crisis? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=439.0s)]
*  Look, I was going there on a mission because there is this pathway to peace that had opened up through the Abraham Accords. I went there to meet with Palestinian leaders, Israeli leaders, and then to continue in the region with people who really believe, as MBS said in an interview on Fox, that there is a credible pathway towards a grand bargain of regional peace with the Palestinian principle, a pillar being very key about it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=456.0s)]
*  Palestinian leaders for the first time were having conversations. In fact, Saudis for the first time came since 1967 came to the West Bank to meet with Palestinian leaders on a pathway to peace. And so here you have this terrorist organization whose very charter doesn't say for the destruction of Israel. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=480.0s)]
*  The very charter is Hitler-esque. They want to destroy Jews, launching missiles. And so for me, before this, I got there early because it's a very important holiday for me personally. It's been about 30 years since, as a Christian, I've been studying Torah and really engaging in a faith that means so much to me. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=497.0s)]
*  I danced with the Torah the night before these attacks, sat and had Shabbat dinner with friends, two of them who've lost family members. One family members were slaughtered in the kibbutz. The other was a nephew who was called up to defend folks and was killed in defending lives, innocent lives. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=520.0s)]
*  This is an ISIS-like terrorist organization who targeted civilians in the most heinous, staggering of ways. And what's more tragic for the Palestinians, who Hamas has murdered, kidnapped Palestinians, Hamas has brutalized its own people, and what is interesting about their pattern right now, known throughout everybody I talked about, talked with in the Middle East, from journalists to business people to members of the Jewish community, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=540.0s)]
*  They all know Hamas' mission is to stop peace. And at the very moment that a pathway to peace opened up, that you heard from the Saudis, from the Emiratis, from folks in Bahrain who understood that we had an opportunity here for a re-upping of the two-state solution, Hamas, terrorists, ISIS-like, Hitler-like folks who hate Jews and want to kill them, opened up one of the worst terrorist attacks in the Middle East. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=566.0s)]
*  They've opened up a lot of terrorist attacks over the last 50 years. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=595.0s)]
*  In terms of that peace process, there was lots of word being sent that there was a move towards Saudi and Israeli normalization, which of course would be an enormous change. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=599.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the criticisms I've heard, and this is independent of what Hamas' motives are, which I can't really define, and you can read their statements if you want to, is that it was an attempt to bypass essentially the peace with Palestinians, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=610.0s)]
*  This idea that you would lock in normalization without resolving the enormous problem of two million people living in essentially a penal colony and the occupation of the West Bank. What do you say to that? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=624.0s)]
*  Well, that's completely wrong. I know that because I'm one of the founding members of the Abraham Accords. I've been very involved in a lot of this diplomatic work. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=633.0s)]
*  I should be on a plane in about a week with Republicans, a small group of us, Republicans, Democrats, going to Saudi Arabia to continue these talks because we cannot let these terrorists, these ISIS-like, Nazi-like people win. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=641.0s)]
*  We're going to continue these conversations. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=655.0s)]
*  Is this going to derail that? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=657.0s)]
*  I stayed in the region. I just came back today because I didn't want to let it derail it. And from Americans to Arabs in the region, everybody wants to continue this pathway and centered in it, as the leader of Saudi Arabia said on Fox News, centered in this has to be a pathway back to the two-state solution and a revocable pathway back to the two-state solution. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=658.0s)]
*  And in my conversations with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans before this attack, we all agreed, State Department agreed, this had to be about peace. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=682.0s)]
*  And so when the very moment when you hear Arab leaders openly discussing an opportunity for peace, an organization founded to kill Jews who after the Oslo Accords 2014, when Arafat and Rabin get the Nobel Peace Prize and there's a pathway to peace, what does Hamas do right after that? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=691.0s)]
*  They go after Israelis. They bomb buses. They target civilians and then use their own people as human shields as Israel exercises its right to self-defense, hoping that the sympathy that they could maybe bring about by the people they are endangering could somehow undermine support for a peace process. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=712.0s)]
*  Well, we're seeing this again. And that's why the debate in America should not be a date. We should have the crystal clarity to support Israel and to call out these Nazi ISIS-like folks who are targeting civilians with an attempt not just to kill and murder Jews, not just to kill and use Palestinian human shields, not just to target. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=732.0s)]
*  Remember, there's Nepalese, Argentinians, French, Americans that all have been killed or held hostage through this. We have to continue the pathway towards peace and human rights for Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=755.0s)]
*  We talk about sort of human shields and attempting to sort of curry favor or public opinion. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=769.0s)]
*  Again, you know, I think the moral responsibility for what happens in Gaza, I can't even begin to debate about whose fault it will be. All I know is that there's 6,000 bombs that have been dropped according to Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=776.0s)]
*  That's more than monthly amounts on Raqqa or Mosul during periods in which we were bombing ISIS at the highest levels of sorties that we ever did, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=788.0s)]
*  What do you say to people who say this is there are millions of civilians there? What are we doing as a U.S.? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=797.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I've been in talks today about creating a humanitarian corridor. There are Americans of Palestinian descent in Gaza right now. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=804.0s)]
*  There are children and innocent suffering. And so we're going to continue as Americans do everything we can to create a humanitarian corridor. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=813.0s)]
*  These are, again, terrorists target civilians. Israel is a democracy, and democracies are stronger when they abide by the rule of law. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=821.0s)]
*  President Biden has said that publicly, where you try to minimize casualties, and that is something that we all can call on Israel as they exercise their right to self-defense, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=830.0s)]
*  to do everything possible to minimize civilian loss as these cowards and terrorists are using their own Palestinian people as human shields. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=840.0s)]
*  It is awful, and we need to do everything possible to help to minimize that damage. But to me, there should be no confusion about this for Americans. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=850.0s)]
*  And I'll say this not just as a United States senator, not just as a patriot who would die for my own country, but I want to say this as a black man. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=859.0s)]
*  When you're black in America, you understand the vulnerability within your own country you love. I saw it as an adult on January 6th. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=867.0s)]
*  The people that stormed the Capitol talked to Capitol police or African Americans. They had signs of hatred, Confederate flags, the vicious, racist things they were saying to Capitol police officers. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=880.0s)]
*  But side by side, those symbols of hate towards black Americans were shirts like Camp Auschwitz shirts. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=896.0s)]
*  Hate has an indiscriminate infection. This is why as an American, as a black American, I will always stand against hate and stand with the people who are targets of hate. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=903.0s)]
*  Just like the Nazis, who didn't just destroy six million Jews, they destroyed gay people, gypsies. I will stand with people who are targets of hate. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=923.0s)]
*  Hamas, like the Nazis and like ISIS, are people who target with hate. I stand with Jews. I stand with Muslims. I stand with gay folks. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=934.0s)]
*  I stand with people right now who all have a common cause to stand against Hamas because Hamas is an indiscriminately hateful people who do not want peace. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=945.0s)]
*  They want to destroy others and stop us from having peace. This is not complicated America. It is not complicated. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=957.0s)]
*  We all must denounce hate and those people who use hate to destroy. That is Hamas. And so I am worried right now. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=966.0s)]
*  I'm worried about rising anti-Semitism in the United States. I led with three other senators, bipartisan, to call for more resources because hate is indiscriminate in its efforts. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=977.0s)]
*  The same hate that killed blacks in a church in South Carolina or the same people who were reeling the same hate that killed in a synagogue. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=989.0s)]
*  And so we all need to take an understanding. Everyone has a responsibility to condemn the hatred of this ISIS Nazi like Hamas and do everything we can to try to get us back to peace, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=997.0s)]
*  to affirming of human rights for all people in that region and again the protection of this country. And this country's unfortunately too often targets of hate. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1009.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. I think again if you could wave a magic wand to get rid of Hamas I think people would take that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1018.0s)]
*  And we said this off camera. I want folks to know when I travel to these other countries, other Arabs, they all know what kind of organization Hamas is. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1026.0s)]
*  I was almost lectured to by leaders in other Arab countries just over the last few days about how horrific Hamas is, what the awful things they have done to Palestinians. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1033.0s)]
*  Arab countries know how dangerous and vicious this organization is. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1045.0s)]
*  I also spoke with someone who is still in Gaza City right now, Yusuf Hamas. He works for a Norwegian NGO. He filed a report we played part of for UK's Channel 4. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1049.0s)]
*  He's lived in Gaza his whole life and described what he's seen the last few days. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1059.0s)]
*  Yusuf Hamas is an advocacy officer with the Norwegian Refugee Council. He has lived in Gaza his whole life and he joins us now. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yusuf, thank you so much for talking to us. Can you tell us where in Gaza you are and what it is like there? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1072.0s)]
*  Thanks for hosting me. I'm located in Bitlaniya, northern part of Gaza Strip. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1080.0s)]
*  And if you want me to describe the situation, it's horror here. It's part of the hell here. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1085.0s)]
*  Obama didn't stop for a second since six days in a row. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1090.0s)]
*  Wherever you go in Gaza, you will see rubbles everywhere, to cross a distance from a place to another place. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1095.0s)]
*  It's like a maze going from street to another street because most of the streets are blocked by rubbles and destruction everywhere. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1103.0s)]
*  No food, no electricity, no water, no internet connection. Even I have to stand in the street just to get signal. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1110.0s)]
*  I'm really surprised that still the phone call is functioning because they usually drop down, dropped off quickly. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1116.0s)]
*  Situation is deteriorating really quickly for the most vulnerable people who had to flee from the northern part, eastern part of Gaza, seeking shelter in the north coast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1125.0s)]
*  Now we are full, even above their capacities. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1134.0s)]
*  Now people who are lucky to have some relatives who live in some areas that haven't been bombed, so they have to go seeking shelter in their houses. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1139.0s)]
*  There is no one housing that is hosting one family. Everyone is hosting another one of their relatives who lost their house or they are forced to flee. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1146.0s)]
*  You were there in 2014, the last time that there was a war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza specifically. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1155.0s)]
*  Is this more destruction? Are the airstrikes and the bombing a wider area than what happened in 2014 in these first six days? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1165.0s)]
*  It was 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2021, and between that also there was a lot of small groundfights. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1175.0s)]
*  This cannot be compared to what we witnessed previously. This is a massive bombardment that they are using. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1181.0s)]
*  Bombardment all over Gaza. There is no single place safe in Gaza. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1188.0s)]
*  Usually when you have escalation in Gaza, you have to go to the ground and you have to go to the ground and you have to go to the ground. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1193.0s)]
*  This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1200.0s)]
*  This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1205.0s)]
*  This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1212.0s)]
*  This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. This is a massive bombardment. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1221.0s)]
*  This is massive land. It's like a block of concrete. The houses are connected to each other. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1228.0s)]
*  So now it's, the situation now is not, cannot compare it to any world or escalation before. It's madness. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1232.0s)]
*  How, you talked about the humanitarian basics, obviously shelter being one of them. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1240.0s)]
*  We have numbers that there are as many as 300,000 people who are now homeless out of a population of 2 million. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1247.0s)]
*  Water, electricity is running out, water, food, like where, just from a, how are people acquiring food and is there clean water still? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1256.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have different sources of water and gas. One of them is the municipality lines. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1267.0s)]
*  But the main issue is electricity because even if you have the source of water, you cannot pump it or push it into your houses. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1272.0s)]
*  The number you are talking about, over 300,000 who are fled into Norwa school, there is double this number who fled to other relatives' house and sheath a hospital. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1278.0s)]
*  There is trashes. There is people are sheltered everywhere in Gaza just seeking shelter in different places. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1288.0s)]
*  It's not only in Norwa school. It's like almost every place that is not governmental and not, I mean, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1295.0s)]
*  and it is related to Norwa, United Nations, trash. People are trying to secure themselves, convincing themselves that these places are safe. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1302.0s)]
*  For example, if you look to a sheath a hospital, it's became from a hospital to a shelter. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1314.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1319.0s)]
*  It's a transfer. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1320.0s)]
*  I'm wondering what, obviously the governing authority in Gaza, Samos, what are they saying to the people of Gaza about what is happening and what is about to happen? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1323.0s)]
*  There are people in Gaza disconnected from the world and from everything else, even in terms of internet communication with each other. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1338.0s)]
*  There is no internet and there is no also signal to communication because all of these signals are being born. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1345.0s)]
*  And trust me, there's two million people in Gaza are thinking and living day by day. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1351.0s)]
*  No, sorry, they are living second by second because no one can ensure the next second that you will be alive. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1355.0s)]
*  What we think about is to secure our children, secure our basically every day I have to go to wait in line in front of a bakery for more than two hours just to get a bucket complete. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1360.0s)]
*  This is the situation in Gaza. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1370.0s)]
*  There is, of course, no way out because of the RAFA crossing. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1373.0s)]
*  Do you, I mean, what you just said it, I guess, second by second. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1379.0s)]
*  I hope that you and you can keep your family safe. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1386.0s)]
*  And I'm so appreciative of your taking time to talk to us. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1390.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1395.0s)]
*  And we are trying to secure our children. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1396.0s)]
*  I had to flee from my house to one of my relatives' house. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1398.0s)]
*  I was lucky to someone who accepted to host me because I live in a bit of a border area. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1401.0s)]
*  Also, my mother, my sisters are now different. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1406.0s)]
*  One of other relatives' house. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1408.0s)]
*  The situation is really unacceptable. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1410.0s)]
*  And also, every night we are afraid from the night in general. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1413.0s)]
*  Now, whenever it's night, it's terror here. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1416.0s)]
*  We are afraid. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1418.0s)]
*  It's a horror movie. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1419.0s)]
*  Every night we are afraid. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1420.0s)]
*  And we are always, every night we are praying to see the daylight again. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1422.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7WlY-9DW3M&t=1436.0s)]
