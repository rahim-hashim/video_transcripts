# Elizabeth Warren reacts to Harris VP pick ‘I’m delighted about Tim Walz’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA)
*  Joining me now is Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, it's great to have you on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=3.44s)]
*  First, I want to just vibe check here and get your reaction to the announcement today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=5.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=9.92s)]
*  I just, I think it's fantastic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=10.92s)]
*  You know, the way I look at this, this is a test of leadership. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=14.36s)]
*  We watched these two candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and this is the most consequential [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=20.92s)]
*  thing they do really as they launch their campaigns into this final run, and that is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=26.82s)]
*  pick a running mate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  And so Donald Trump says he wants to go with a venture capitalist who has almost no public [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=34.34s)]
*  service record at all and really has never had much experience governing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  That's who he wants to be, the last person to talk to him before he makes a decision. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=50.38s)]
*  The guy whose main experience has been venture capital funding from billionaires in Silicon [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=55.9s)]
*  Valley. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=62.18s)]
*  By contrast, Kamala Harris has said, the person I want for a partner, the one I want in my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=63.58s)]
*  ear, the last person to talk to me, is somebody who has been a public school teacher, somebody [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=70.44s)]
*  who has a 24 year military career, but someone who has spent his entire life in service. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=78.94s)]
*  Someone who as governor of Minnesota has gotten so much done, they're the right fights from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=90.38s)]
*  the heart. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=97.66s)]
*  So much done for hungry kids so they can have lunch and go and learn, for women to be able [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=98.74s)]
*  to make their own decisions about abortion and IVF. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=106.1s)]
*  That's the kind of person she picks for the person who will be her ultimate partner in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=110.78s)]
*  the work that gets done by the next administration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=118.14s)]
*  So I really see this as a moment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=121.5s)]
*  I'm delighted about Tim Walz, but I really see it as a moment that's one more measure [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=123.22s)]
*  of the difference between a Donald Trump and his presidency as he would lay it out and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=129.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris and what she's telling us about the America she wants to be and the kind of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=135.28s)]
*  president she wants to be. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=140.32s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about running for president because I think there's probably [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=142.6s)]
*  no experience quite like it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=145.78s)]
*  I've never experienced it myself, but I've covered a lot of it and I've talked to a lot [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=148.28s)]
*  of folks while they've been doing it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=151.12s)]
*  It strikes me as a very bizarre undertaking for a lot of reasons. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=153.04s)]
*  It's different than any other office you'll run for. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=156.72s)]
*  I'm just curious what you think of Kamala Harris, who's someone who you campaigned alongside [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=159.04s)]
*  of when you were running in 2020 has had this this campaign that no one could have really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  predicted or crafted that hasn't ever existed in American history. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=170.6s)]
*  What she's sort of taken on the last few weeks and what you make of it so far given that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  you've you've also you understand a little bit about about how difficult running for president [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's a really interesting question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  And if I can, let me frame it out this way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  You run for president, boy, it's like it's like trying to cross an ocean with winds going [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=193.12s)]
*  in every direction. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=198.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=199.8s)]
*  And and you've got to you've got to stay on course for what it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=200.8s)]
*  You've got to know why you're there and what it is you're fighting for. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=204.56s)]
*  I've known Kamala Harris for 14 years now, and we got to know each other in a different [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=208.6s)]
*  kind of storm. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=214.08s)]
*  We got to know each other in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=215.08s)]
*  And following that crisis, I was trying to set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=220.12s)]
*  go CFPB. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=224.68s)]
*  Kamala was the new attorney general for California. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=226.68s)]
*  And both of us were working shoulder to shoulder fighting back against these giant banks that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=231.08s)]
*  had cheated people and now were busily trying to take away homes from as many of them as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  they possibly could. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=244.12s)]
*  And so I got to know her really down in the trenches, and I got to watch her when there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=246.66s)]
*  was a deal on the table that the attorneys general were going to go for all around the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=252.52s)]
*  country and not Kamala. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=256.68s)]
*  She said, I'm holding out for something better for the people of California. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=258.42s)]
*  I'm responsible for them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=261.74s)]
*  I'm going to stand up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=263.08s)]
*  She was under enormous pressure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=264.62s)]
*  And yet she was steely. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=267.8s)]
*  She hung in there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=269.56s)]
*  She knew what she was doing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=270.56s)]
*  And she never got blown off course. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=271.56s)]
*  I think of that, and I've worked with Kamala since then, both in her years as attorney [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=274.38s)]
*  general, when she decided to run for the Senate, one of the first to get in there and endorse [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=278.46s)]
*  her because I thought she'd be terrific, work with her in the Senate, work with her as vice [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=286.64s)]
*  So I see this as, yes, who would have predicted what's unfolded in the last three weeks? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=288.34s)]
*  It's just been amazing and astonishing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  And yet it is a part, at least as I see it, of she's doing what she always wanted to do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=297.3s)]
*  She's out there fighting for what she believes in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=306.62s)]
*  She's just being given a different set of tools. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=309.26s)]
*  She's in a different form. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=311.7s)]
*  But there's the person who was the prosecutor, who was the AG, who was the senator, who was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=314.06s)]
*  the VP, who's always fought for working people, who's always been there for the underdog, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  who's always had the courage to try to hold the most powerful people accountable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=325.3s)]
*  And that's what I see her doing again and again. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=331.3s)]
*  Every time I listen to one of her speeches, I think, yeah, that's the same Kamala. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's the person who is bringing us together, not just as a party, but as a nation and showing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=340.02s)]
*  us a vision of who we can be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=348.76s)]
*  Turn the page on the old guy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=351.5s)]
*  Let's go forward. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=353.26s)]
*  I'm recalling this from memory because I remember covering that proposed settlement between [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  the banks on foreclosure. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=358.98s)]
*  They were foreclosing on people's homes they didn't have the title to, often because they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=359.98s)]
*  had completely lost the chain of custody of that title. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, I think there were two AGs who rejected the deal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=367.46s)]
*  It was Kamala Harris and the attorney general of Delaware at the time, Bo Biden, of course, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=370.34s)]
*  the president's son, who later passed away. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  And I believe they worked together on that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to question you about the often the sort of delightfully small D democratic disputatious [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  coalition of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=388.7s)]
*  It's got lots of different factions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=391.66s)]
*  It's got lots of different interests. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=393.5s)]
*  I think that's part of a healthy democracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=394.56s)]
*  We've only got two major parties and two major coalitions. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  There's going to be factional battles over all sorts of stuff. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=398.82s)]
*  You know that very well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  You've been involved with them in one way or the other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you see this pick of Tim Waltz as having some factional significance? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=404.26s)]
*  This is a pick for the left. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=408.48s)]
*  This is a pick for the centrist. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  This signals something factional to you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=412.0s)]
*  Look, I think it's picking someone who will be a good partner for her. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=415.24s)]
*  And I really do think that's how she looks at it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=421.32s)]
*  She's been a good partner to Joe Biden. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=423.48s)]
*  And I think she wants more than anything else, a good partner, an authentic partner, somebody [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=425.92s)]
*  who's not just gluing it on to be out here in public, but somebody who really from the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  heart feels it all and has the courage to get into tough fights and who is willing to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=437.38s)]
*  do what needs to be done for the team. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=443.58s)]
*  And always I want to underscore about Tim Waltz, who delivered for the people of Minnesota [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=445.64s)]
*  when he had the skinniest possible majority. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=451.94s)]
*  Yes, one vote. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=454.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=455.38s)]
*  He had a one vote majority in his legislature and yet was able to talk across the aisle [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=456.38s)]
*  and get people together to produce for families in Minnesota. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=463.58s)]
*  And I think that's for me, that's the heart of understanding what this pick is. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=469.26s)]
*  She looks, I think, I don't want to speak for her, but what I see is she can look over [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=474.36s)]
*  at Tim Waltz and say, that's someone I can count on, that someone the American people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=479.66s)]
*  can count on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=485.78s)]
*  And so that's why she wants it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxyyZJEysA&t=487.02s)]
