# ‘Alternate reality’ Trumpworld lies get more outrageous with a month to election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. 32 days until the election. And with us very close, we've been hearing a lot about misinformation lately, the danger it poses in this very tense and heightened political climate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think the term misinformation, which is a perfectly fine term, doesn't quite do enough to capture what is happening with one half of the American two-party system. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=12.0s)]
*  Outright brazen, dangerous, ludicrous lies in denial of the most obvious reality, the one you can see before you. That has become not just the primary tactic for Donald Trump and JD Vance's running mate, but the operating principle increasingly for the entire Republican Party across lines of faction. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=22.0s)]
*  Just listen to this telling exchange on the economy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=38.0s)]
*  No, it's not. It's inflation has devastated our economy. It's one of the big problems we have. And on jobs, we have the illegals have taken more jobs than anybody else. You have illegals coming in and they're taking the jobs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=41.0s)]
*  Just a lie. Just a lie. Donald Trump knows the economy is doing very well. He knows the quote illegals undocumented, unauthorized workers haven't taken all the jobs. Inflation has cooled. Jobs are up a lot. Wages are up. The stock market is booming. He denies it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=62.0s)]
*  As if by repeating the lie enough times, he can just change the underlying reality itself. That's the idea here. Another one. Again, just from today, a simple small one, but perfectly indicative. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=77.0s)]
*  Trump comes out and boasts that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, has endorsed Trump for president. Now you think you can't lie about that. It's too easy to check. You could probably guess what the problem is here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=87.0s)]
*  Jamie Dimon has not endorsed Donald Trump for president. That's just a flat out lie. You could just call up his spokespeople, as reporters did. The spokesman said Jamie Dimon has not endorsed anyone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=98.0s)]
*  Now when Trump was called out for this obvious brazen lie, he then resorted to even more lying, telling NBC News, I don't know anything about it. And somebody put it up. No, I don't know. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=110.0s)]
*  After NBC News explained that Dimon did not endorse Trump, he responded, well then somebody is using his name. And the original post with the lie is still up, by the way. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=121.0s)]
*  Again, this is just a perfect example of how the Trump Republican Party operates. Today, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a person who had once upon a time people thought was like a serious dude, he called these new jobs numbers, right, put out by independent civil servants, another fake jobs report out from the Biden-Harris government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=133.0s)]
*  Basically accusing the White House of cooking the books. And at some level, it's not anything new, right, we've been living with this for so long. Everyone knows Trump and his maga cronies are liars. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=152.0s)]
*  But there's real danger here, right? The lies are dangerous. They have a cost. Like, for instance, most obviously, the big lie of a stolen 2020 election, the lie that Donald Trump repeats to this day almost every day, even as his running mate tries to gaslight us all into believing he doesn't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=164.0s)]
*  And that lie caused the deadly January 6th insurrection, election workers to flee their homes due to threats of violence. It is the means through which Trump may be priming supporters to do it all over again a month from now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=181.0s)]
*  In fact, he seems dead set on that if he loses. There's also Trump's disgusting blood libel directed to Haitian migrants, racist lies about folks stealing and eating pets. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=193.0s)]
*  That directly led to a series of bomb threats and fears for safety in Springfield, Ohio, and workplaces and in schools. And it's a lie, by the way, that JD Vance admits is a lie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=202.0s)]
*  The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=215.0s)]
*  Make stories, right? So that claim about Haitians is probably the most notable. But again, Trump's dangerous, violent lies about migrants is an everyday occurrence, right? They don't end there with graphic and violent rhetoric. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=231.0s)]
*  We're releasing migrants into our country, but these are killers. These are people at the highest level of killing. They cut your throat and they won't even think about it the next morning. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=246.0s)]
*  They won't even think about it. And these people are all over the place and they're killing people. I could go through the stories and I won't. But all over, sometimes I do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=260.0s)]
*  They come up, they grab young girls and they slice them up right in front of their parents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=270.0s)]
*  Now, these are dangerous things to say. And they are incitement of a source. The exact same thing is happening with the lies that he's been pushing around Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=276.0s)]
*  That FEMA disaster relief money is somehow being taken from those affected and redirected to migrants. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=289.0s)]
*  So we now have no money that was supposed to be used for tragedy, for hurricanes. And this was a tragic hurricane. This was maybe the worst hurricane we've ever had. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=296.0s)]
*  And he's got no money. And we say, what happened to all the money? They were given billions for this. He spent it on illegal migrants coming into the country, a big percentage of which are murderers. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=306.0s)]
*  So we are poisoning our country. Our country is being poisoned. Our country is being ruined. It's being ruined by these people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=318.0s)]
*  And they took billions of dollars and used it for settlements of people that came in, many of which are criminals. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=326.0s)]
*  Again, this is fabricated. It's made up. It's a lie. In fact, the only president that took FEMA money for migrant detention was Donald Trump when he was president. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=336.0s)]
*  But it's just an alternate reality, right? This is now gospel among a certain percentage of the population. And the message is sticking. Voters are buying the alternate reality he's selling. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=344.0s)]
*  A voter asked him about it at his rally just last hour. And again, he lied again. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=352.0s)]
*  Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican, even got in on the conspiracy game. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=356.0s)]
*  Listen to this one. Quote, yes, they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=362.0s)]
*  And I have to admit, when I first saw this, I thought it was a parody, or that someone had taken over her account. But no. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=369.0s)]
*  Now the idea here, in case you're not following this particular right-wing conspiracy theory, is that Hurricane Helene was created and sent to Western North Carolina to punish people that don't vote for Donald Trump, even though Asheville, a big part of it, is famously a liberal town in North Carolina. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=376.0s)]
*  Now I shouldn't be surprised. This is coming from the woman who said famously, famously, that some Rothschild fabricated space laser was the thing that started the California wildfire. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=393.0s)]
*  But that was before she was a member of Congress. So now she's a member of Congress. Like, they control the weather out there for everyone to read is a pretty shocking lie. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=405.0s)]
*  I mean, actually, it's out past a lie. A lie doesn't really do it justice. It's a lurid delusion. It's a form of madness she's hoping to spread. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=414.0s)]
*  Also, who exactly is the they, you think? Think for a second. Who's the they? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=422.0s)]
*  Yesterday, one Republican state senator from North Carolina, Republican, was begging folks to stop spreading these lies and conspiracy theories about Western North Carolina, which are actually hampering recovery efforts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=427.0s)]
*  Please help stop this junk. It is just a distraction to people trying to do their job. Please don't let these crazy stories consume you or you continually contact your elected officials to see if they are true. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=439.0s)]
*  One North Carolina Democrat spoke to the HuffPost about just how polluted the information environment had become, thanks in part to Donald Trump. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=453.0s)]
*  The biggest issue is rumors and fake memes and the photos of people being trapped in areas around the country, around the county. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=460.0s)]
*  And we send folks out to rescue them. And there's no one there to be rescued. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=467.0s)]
*  Precious resources at the county level amidst a national disaster going out to rescue people were not there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=473.0s)]
*  These are dangerous lies in the middle of a serious natural disaster has left over 200 people dead. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=480.0s)]
*  And it's part of a larger attempt to trick and scare voters and basically to sort of whisk them into an alternate reality. Right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=486.0s)]
*  All part of the same scheme. J.D. Vance being unable to say Trump lost the election. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=496.0s)]
*  FEMA stole all the money and spend it on immigrants. Joe Biden is cooking the books, the Bureau label statistics. They can control the weather. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=502.0s)]
*  What do you even do with stuff like that? Like, where do you start combating a lie like that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=511.0s)]
*  The plain fact is that there's been a complete and total epistemic breakdown among tens of millions of our fellow Americans. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=519.0s)]
*  That breakdown, that brazen lying is what brought threats of violence to the people of Springfield. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=528.0s)]
*  It is right now, as I speak to you, actively hampering an ongoing hurricane recovery. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=535.0s)]
*  And nearly four years ago, it brought an armed angry mob to our nation's capital. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=542.0s)]
*  And if left unabated, I fear it is going to get people hurt again. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=547.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83MU2Sw3yY&t=564.0s)]
