# ‘We cannot give up on peace’: Biden vows support for Ukraine, Israel in address
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w)
*  Good evening, my fellow Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=0.0s)]
*  We're facing an inflection point in history. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=2.96s)]
*  One of those moments where the decisions we make today [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=5.74s)]
*  are going to determine the future for decades to come. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=9.34s)]
*  That's what I'd like to talk with you about tonight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=13.3s)]
*  You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=16.14s)]
*  They told me I'm the first American President [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=19.22s)]
*  to travel there during the war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=20.82s)]
*  I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And most movingly, I met with Israelis [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=26.02s)]
*  who had personally lived through horrific horror [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=28.08s)]
*  of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=30.66s)]
*  More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=34.56s)]
*  including at least 32 American citizens. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=38.16s)]
*  Scores of innocence from infants to the elderly grandparents, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=41.8s)]
*  Israelis, Americans taken hostage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=45.8s)]
*  As I told the families of Americans [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=48.5s)]
*  being held captive by Hamas, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  we're pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  As President, there is no higher priority for me [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=55.66s)]
*  than the safety of Americans held hostage. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=58.4s)]
*  The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=62.14s)]
*  unadulterated evil in the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  But sadly, the Jewish people know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=66.48s)]
*  perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=68.08s)]
*  to the depravity of people [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=71.28s)]
*  when they want to inflict pain on others. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=72.68s)]
*  In Israel, I saw people who were strong, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=75.02s)]
*  determined, resilient, and also angry, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=78.22s)]
*  in shock and in deep, deep pain. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=80.86s)]
*  I also spoke with President Abbas, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority, and reiterated, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=85.02s)]
*  the United States remains committed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=87.82s)]
*  to the Palestinian people's right to dignity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=89.32s)]
*  and to self-determination. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=92.38s)]
*  The actions of Hamas terrorists don't take that right away. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  Like so many other, I'm heartbroken [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=99.32s)]
*  by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=102.36s)]
*  including the explosion at the hospital in Gaza, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  which was not done by the Israelis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=107.56s)]
*  We mourn every innocent life we've had [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=110.3s)]
*  lost. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=112.82s)]
*  We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=114.02s)]
*  who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=117.26s)]
*  You know, the assault on Israel [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=121.06s)]
*  echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=122.66s)]
*  and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=125.04s)]
*  people that were very badly hurt [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=129.0s)]
*  since Putin launched his all-out invasion. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=131.94s)]
*  We've not forgotten the mass graves, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=135.34s)]
*  the bodies found bearing signs of torture, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=137.54s)]
*  rape used as a weapon by the Russians, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=140.48s)]
*  and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=142.98s)]
*  forcibly taken into Russia, stolen from their parents. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=145.58s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Hamas and Putin represent different threats, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=151.38s)]
*  but they share this in common. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=153.92s)]
*  They both want to completely annihilate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=155.82s)]
*  a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=157.72s)]
*  Hamas stated purpose for existing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=160.82s)]
*  is the destruction of the state of Israel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=163.5s)]
*  and the murder of Jewish people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=165.1s)]
*  Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=167.42s)]
*  Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  and innocent Palestinian families [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  are suffering greatly because of them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=175.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=178.16s)]
*  or ever had real statehood. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=183.26s)]
*  And just two weeks ago, he told the world [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=186.2s)]
*  that if the United States and our allies withdraw [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  and if the United States withdraw, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  our allies will as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=191.98s)]
*  Military support for Ukraine would have, quote, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=193.98s)]
*  a week left to live, but we're not withdrawing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=196.66s)]
*  I know these conflicts can seem far away, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  and it's natural to ask, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=202.22s)]
*  why does this matter to America? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  So let me share with you why making sure [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=206.16s)]
*  Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=208.55999999999997s)]
*  for America's national security. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=210.7s)]
*  You know, history has taught us that when terrorists [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=213.33999999999997s)]
*  don't pay a price for their terror, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=217.7s)]
*  they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=220.64s)]
*  They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=224.64s)]
*  and the world keep rising. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=227.82s)]
*  So if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  and control of Ukraine, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  he won't limit himself just to Ukraine. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Putin's already threatened to remind, quote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=237.92s)]
*  remind Poland that their Western land [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  was a gift from Russia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  One of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=249.14s)]
*  Russia's Baltic provinces. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=251.76s)]
*  These are all NATO allies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=257.44s)]
*  and has been the cornerstone of American security. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=261.14s)]
*  And if Putin attacks a NATO ally, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=263.94s)]
*  we will defend every inch of NATO [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=266.28s)]
*  which a treaty requires and calls for. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=267.82s)]
*  We'll have something that we do not seek. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=270.98s)]
*  Make it clear, we do not seek. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=274.12s)]
*  We do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=275.56s)]
*  or fighting against Russia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=278.96s)]
*  Beyond Europe, we know that our allies [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=281.26s)]
*  and maybe most important adversaries [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=283.96s)]
*  and competitors are watching. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=285.7s)]
*  They're watching our response in Ukraine as well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=287.64s)]
*  And if we walk away and let Putin erase [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=290.74s)]
*  Ukraine's independence, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=292.64s)]
*  would the aggressives around the world [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=294.54s)]
*  be emboldened to try the same? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=295.94s)]
*  The risk of conflict and chaos [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=298.78s)]
*  could spread in other parts of the world, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=300.24s)]
*  in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=302.68s)]
*  especially in the Middle East. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=305.18s)]
*  Iran is supporting Russia's Ukraine [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=307.68s)]
*  and is supporting Hamas [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=311.76s)]
*  and other terrorist groups in the region, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=313.38s)]
*  and will continue to hold them accountable, I might add. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=315.82s)]
*  The United States and our partners across the region [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=318.86s)]
*  are working to build a better future for the Middle East. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=321.56s)]
*  One, where the Middle East is more stable, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=324.5s)]
*  better connected to its neighbors, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=327.56s)]
*  and through innovative projects like the Indian Middle East [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=329.8s)]
*  and Europe Rail Corridor that I announced this year [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=332.54s)]
*  at the summit of the world's biggest economies. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=335.52s)]
*  More predictable markets, more employment, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=339.0s)]
*  less rage, less grievances, less war when connected. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=341.8s)]
*  It benefits the people who would benefit the people [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=345.8s)]
*  of the Middle East and would benefit us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=347.56s)]

*  to operate by the laws of war. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=438.52s)]

*  It's also intensified in the wake of recent events [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=500.32s)]
*  that led to the horrific threats and attacks [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=503.24s)]
*  that both shock us and break our hearts. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=505.4s)]
*  On October 7th, terror attacks have triggered deep scars [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=508.68s)]
*  and terrible memories in the Jewish community. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=513.4s)]

*  the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=531.0s)]

*  saying to yourselves, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=538.4s)]
*  here we go again with Islamophobia [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=539.9200000000001s)]

*  a proud Palestinian American family. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=563.28s)]
*  We can't stand by and stand silent when this happens. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=566.2s)]
*  We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=569.9200000000001s)]

*  when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=593.28s)]

*  or in our communities. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=612.24s)]
*  I must renounce violence and vitriol, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=617.12s)]
*  When I was in Israel yesterday, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=621.04s)]

*  we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  they need to defend themselves and their country [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=658.12s)]

*  They are succeeding. When Putin invaded Ukraine, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  he thought he would take Kiev and all of Ukraine [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=670.0s)]
*  in a matter of days. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=673.0799999999999s)]

*  and he continues to fail. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  Kiev still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=679.76s)]

*  You know, just as in World War II, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=764.7600000000001s)]
*  today patriotic American workers [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=767.4000000000001s)]
*  are building the arsenal of democracy [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  and serving the cause of freedom. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=772.08s)]
*  Let me close with this. Earlier this year, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=775.08s)]
*  I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  There I boarded a train with blacked out windows [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=782.72s)]
*  for a 10-hour ride each way to Kyiv [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  to stand with the people of Ukraine [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=788.7600000000001s)]
*  ahead of the one-year anniversary [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=790.32s)]
*  of their brave fight against Putin. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=792.2s)]
*  And I'm told I was the first American [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  to enter a war zone not controlled [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=796.6400000000001s)]
*  by the United States military since President Lincoln. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  With me was just a small group of security personnel [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=801.96s)]
*  and a few advisors. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=805.88s)]
*  But when I exited that train and met Zelensky, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky, I didn't feel alone. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=810.48s)]
*  I was bringing with me the idea of America, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  the promise of America to the people [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  who are today fighting for the same things [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=819.44s)]
*  we fought for 250 years ago. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=821.08s)]
*  Freedom, independence, self-determination. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=823.84s)]
*  As I walked through Kyiv with President Zelensky, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  with air raid sirens sounding in the distance, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=830.5200000000001s)]
*  I felt something I've always believed, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  more strongly than ever before. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  America is a beacon to the world. Still. Still. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  Whereas my friend Madeleine Albright said, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=844.2s)]
*  we are the indispensable nation. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=847.0s)]
*  Tonight there are innocent people all over the world [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=849.84s)]
*  who hope because of us, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  who believe in a better life because of us, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=854.72s)]
*  who are desperate not to be forgotten by us [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=857.32s)]
*  and are waiting for us. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=861.08s)]
*  But time is of the essence. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=863.72s)]
*  I know we have our divisions at home. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  We have to get past them. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=868.96s)]
*  We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=870.64s)]
*  get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=873.24s)]
*  We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=876.12s)]
*  and tyrants like Putin win. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=878.52s)]
*  I refuse to let that happen. In moments like these, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=880.9200000000001s)]
*  we have to remind, we have to remember who we are. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=884.9200000000001s)]
*  We are the United States of America. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  The United States of America. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=889.84s)]
*  And there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  if we do it together. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=895.32s)]
*  My fellow Americans, thank you for your time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=898.08s)]
*  May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjlC093P2_w&t=901.0s)]
