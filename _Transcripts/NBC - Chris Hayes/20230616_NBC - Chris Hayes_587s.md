# Comer ‘MSNBC makes fun of me’ because Biden witnesses 'are currently missing’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4)
*  We aren't interested in whether or not the accusations against Vice President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden are accurate or not. Senator, how damning is this document to the sitting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  US president? Well it's, I don't know that and that's what we need to know. But you've read it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=12.24s)]
*  I read it. Let's put it this way, there's accusations in it. Where is that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=19.2s)]
*  informant today? Where are these whistleblowers? Well unfortunately we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=24.58s)]
*  can't track down the informants. This oligarch is a high ranking, was a high [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=30.22s)]
*  ranking member or owner of Burisma? Yes that is exactly right. So have you had any contact with him? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=34.54s)]
*  Unfortunately nobody's had any contact with him for the last three years. So [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=43.34s)]
*  Republicans to put it mildly have been obsessed with promoting and investigating a bogus debunked [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=50.46s)]
*  conspiracy theory that Joe Biden as vice president took millions of dollars in bribes from a foreign [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=57.18s)]
*  national. House Republicans, specifically the chair of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=62.38s)]
*  threatened the FBI director with a contempt of Congress vote if he did not show them some [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  unsubstantiated whistleblower form. And now the latest Republican bombshell? Well that revelation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=72.18s)]
*  is that there is or at least several audio tapes between Joe Biden and an executive from the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=79.24s)]
*  Ukrainian firm Burisma that prove once and for all that Joe Biden took bribes while serving as vice [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=85.24s)]
*  president in the Obama administration. Except here's the thing, they're not so sure that those tapes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=93.6s)]
*  actually exist. There are two recordings from with on one end of this phone line or whatever is Joe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=100.48s)]
*  Joseph, Robin O. Biden and another is someone from Burisma. Yes. Because Biden has said [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=108.16s)]
*  unequivocally time and time again I have nothing to do with Burisma, I know nothing about it. And [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=114.16s)]
*  you, Chuck Grassley, has heard his voice on these recordings? So Grassley has not heard them. What [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Grassley has done is he's the only senator who's read an unredacted version of the FD 1023. So he's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=127.2s)]
*  read the report and the report alleges that these recordings exist. We don't know for a fact that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=134.16s)]
*  that's true. So these recordings are legit. You can confirm they are legitimate. Well they were, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=139.68s)]
*  I can confirm they were listed in the 1023 that the FBI redacted. We don't know if they're legit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=144.4s)]
*  or not. So it's quite apparent that the whole Republican boondoggle is falling apart. And here's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=150.76s)]
*  the thing, they are getting pretty defensive about it. Watch. You have the liberal media like MSNBC [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=157.08s)]
*  with their low-acute audience that are sitting there and they're being told bad things about me [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  and members of the oversight because we have the audacity to investigate. MSNBC makes fun of me when [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=169.44s)]
*  I said that there are a lot of people that were involved in the Biden shenanigans that are currently [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=174.12s)]
*  missing. Yeah so look it is against that backdrop of what you just heard there of missing witnesses, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=181.28s)]
*  an uncorroborated report, a bombshell audio tape that may or may not exist that Congressman Dan [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=188.36s)]
*  Goldman of New York who actually sits on the Oversight Committee that is investigating the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=195.2s)]
*  president debunked the Republican conspiracy theory. Did the majority actually find some actual [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=199.6s)]
*  evidence of wrongdoing by the president? Of course not. But it's even worse than that. This document [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=207.6s)]
*  that they will not stop talking about is shockingly just a three-year-old secondhand hearsay uncorroborated [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  rehashing of Rudy Giuliani's bogus allegations that he got from Ukrainian corrupt Ukrainian officials. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=224.72s)]
*  Now we all know that former President Donald Trump was impeached because he tried to extort [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=234.72s)]
*  President Zelensky to announce an investigation into this Ukrainian company Burisma that would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=239.04s)]
*  benefit Trump's political campaign. The theory goes that then vice president urged Ukraine to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=245.92s)]
*  fire its prosecutor general because he was investigating Burisma and the president wanted [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=252.56s)]
*  to help his son who was on the Burisma board. You know where Rudy Giuliani got this information from? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  That fired prosecutor general himself, the corrupt prosecutor general. And we know with [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=265.68s)]
*  absolute certainty now that the truth is exactly the opposite. And to be very clear, then vice [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=273.2s)]
*  president Biden executed official United States foreign policy shared by the EU and the IMF [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  to urge Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general because he was not prosecuting corruption in Ukraine. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=287.68s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat of Texas who serves on the Oversight Committee. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=297.52s)]
*  She joins me now. Congresswoman, it's great to see you again. Thank you for making time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=301.44s)]
*  What do you make of this nonsense from the Republicans? I mean, this recycled Giuliani [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  created conspiracy theory that now seems to be at the center of this Republican obsession. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=310.64s)]
*  I mean, the Republicans are like good at distractions, and that's exactly what we have. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=317.68s)]
*  It is so unfortunate that they're talking about what they read, but let me make it very plain for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=326.24s)]
*  the people that are watching. The very first document that we read specifically said that we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=332.72s)]
*  are not to disclose what it is that we're reading. So I'm going to tell you that for some reason, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=338.72s)]
*  I don't really trust their ability to actually read and take in what it is that they've read [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=344.0s)]
*  because the very first page said, do not talk about the content. And so all I will say, because [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=349.68s)]
*  as Democrats, we like to follow rules, is that their rendition of what was in this document [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=356.56s)]
*  is a little different from what I read in this document. Now, granted, I did read the redacted [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=364.16s)]
*  version. I've read redacted documents for years and years and years practicing law, but I'm telling [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=371.6s)]
*  you, I don't think that those few black marks that I saw had all this information that the Senator [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  has been talking about. And I also want people to understand what they like to do is they want to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  deflect and say, no, no, no, forget Trump. What about Hillary? No, no, no, no, forget Trump. What [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  about Biden? Well, what about them? Let's be clear. Neither one of them have been indicted for any [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=396.56s)]
*  wrongdoing, yet they've both been investigated extensively, and the president is still currently [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=401.28s)]
*  being investigated. But you know what? I can almost guarantee you, I would put money on it, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  that at the end of the investigation that is finally taking place with the president [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=410.88s)]
*  and his ability or his handling of the classified documents, I can tell you that he most likely will [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=414.64s)]
*  not end up facing the number of charges that Trump is facing. I just called me, you know, Ms. Cleo, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=422.08s)]
*  but I don't believe that he will end up facing a similar fate. Well, let me just say it's on [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=429.68s)]
*  brand for Republicans, to your point. It's on brand for Republicans to not be able to follow [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=435.12s)]
*  the rules and to give up what is considered to be confidential information, whether it's Trump holding [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=439.12s)]
*  on to these documents in Mar-a-Lago or, as you were just saying, the Republicans reading a document [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=444.56s)]
*  from the FBI that they were told not to disclose and then turn around and broadcast it on TV. But [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  it kind of makes me wonder, as you said, this is about politics, more or less, and I'm kind of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=454.4s)]
*  putting words here in your mouth, but tell me about this, because I think Republicans are doing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=460.08s)]
*  this or pushing this the same way they pushed Benghazi to try to lower Hillary Clinton's numbers. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=464.24s)]
*  That's what Kevin McCarthy at the time said, and now they're trying to do this to hurt Joe [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=470.0s)]
*  Biden politically. Am I wrong? No, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's nothing but a game for them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=474.8s)]
*  And the problem is that we have real lives on the other side of this game that they're playing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=480.48s)]
*  And I do want to go back really quickly to something that you just said. We should not [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=486.32s)]
*  trust Republicans with any secrets. I mean, if you all haven't realized that from seeing all the boxes [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=490.16s)]
*  in the bathroom, just listen to this nonsense. And at the same time, we also should not expect [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  the truth out of the Republicans, because theoretically, I guess technically, they haven't [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  necessarily disclosed everything that was in the documents, because honestly, some of this stuff [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=506.32s)]
*  they're talking about, I'm like, that wasn't in there. That wasn't in there. And another good [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=511.04s)]
*  point to be made about the document is something that Dan Goldman was bringing out. I want people [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=515.68s)]
*  to understand the timeline. This is, I think it was three pages total. It was basically two pages [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=521.2s)]
*  and then a portion of another page that we reviewed. And as far as the timeline is concerned, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=527.12s)]
*  we're talking about someone recounting something that was told to them at least three years after [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=533.28s)]
*  allegedly they were told this and they had all these details in their mind and whatnot. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=540.24s)]
*  And also to be clear, as my ranking member, who can be trusted with the truth, Jamie Raskin, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=545.6s)]
*  he laid it out and made it clear that it's not that this information came and then it was just [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=551.12s)]
*  thrown away. It was actually Trump's administration. It was Trump's DOJ [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=557.68s)]
*  that received this information and they followed through and there was nothing to follow through with. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg675Z-0et4&t=562.16s)]
