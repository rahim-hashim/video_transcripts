# Trump stolen documents found among Diet Coke, Christmas ornaments, new photos reveal
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw)
*  We have new pictures from Mar-a-Lago that really capture the sheer disorder of the place [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=0.0s)]
*  where Donald Trump stashed classified documents from the White House in 2021. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=4.7s)]
*  There were boxes of documents found mingled in with mementos, a bunch of golf shirts, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=9.34s)]
*  and some printer photo paper. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  I think those are golf shirts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=16.44s)]
*  I hope those are golf shirts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=17.68s)]
*  Like a college student cleaning out their dorm room at the end of the semester. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=19.36s)]
*  There was this box of classified material right next to a 2019 New York Times Sunday [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=22.96s)]
*  which, you know, good to hold on to those. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=28.5s)]
*  There were other records like this unsigned letter to a Sandy Hook family found in a closet [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  sitting casually next to a case of Diet Coke surrounded by Trump's vanity picture and surplus [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=35.22s)]
*  MAGA swag. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=39.78s)]
*  There were dozens of boxes, many labeled, as you can see here, mixed in with old clothes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=41.3s)]
*  and hoarded newspapers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Both these pictures taken by Trump co-defendant Walt Notta shows boxes with classified materials [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=47.78s)]
*  that he just spilled out over the floor. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=52.66s)]
*  And the whole reason we're seeing these pictures is because they are part of a filing from [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=55.22s)]
*  special counsel Jack Smithstein responding to an attempt by Trump's lawyers to throw [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  the whole case out based on how investigators handled the documents. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=62.58s)]
*  Smithstein points out Trump personally chose to keep documents containing some of the nation's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=66.74s)]
*  most highly guarded secrets in cardboard boxes along with a collection of other personally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=70.66s)]
*  chosen keepsakes of various sizes and shapes from his presidency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=74.78s)]
*  Oh, the shade. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=78.9s)]
*  Newspapers, thank you notes, Christmas ornaments, magazines, clothing, and photographs of himself [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=80.38s)]
*  and others to anyone other than Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=83.94s)]
*  The boxes had no apparent organization whatsoever. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=85.78s)]
*  Christy Greenberg is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, where [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=89.34s)]
*  she served as deputy chief of the criminal division. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=92.38s)]
*  She's been filing this case and she joins me now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=94.34s)]
*  So there's the sort of absurdity of the conditions under which all this was stored. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=96.86s)]
*  And we're getting more evidence of that, too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=102.78s)]
*  But I find it even more absurd the filing from Trump's lawyers, the seriousness with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=104.66s)]
*  which Eileen Cannon appears to be taking it and Jack Smith's motion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=109.86s)]
*  So what are Trump's lawyers arguing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=115.96s)]
*  Well, that is the problem because their argument has evolved. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=118.3s)]
*  Initially it was a declassified everything, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=122.98s)]
*  I told my lawyers, I told all my national security officials, I declassified it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=125.94s)]
*  Then it was, well, I selected certain items like the priest with the communion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  No, seriously, it was actually a kind of transformation of the substance of the thing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=135.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  So that was the first argument. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=141.33999999999997s)]
*  Then it was I personally selected these and because I brought them to my residence, they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  became personal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  Then it was the FBI planted them, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=147.26s)]
*  And I didn't know anything about them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=149.26s)]
*  And now it's this, well, I need to know the order of the boxes because maybe some of them [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=151.42s)]
*  were buried and I didn't see them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=157.06s)]
*  Or maybe because it's next to this letter from Sandy Hook, I would know the date. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=159.48s)]
*  And it was old and maybe they were forgotten. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=163.7s)]
*  They are all over the place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=166.1s)]
*  But aren't they also saying we want you to throw all this evidence out because it was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  not orderly enough in the way that it was taken? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  Yes, which again isn't really a thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to keep, it would have been impossible as you're transporting boxes to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=180.06s)]
*  make sure you keep the Christmas ornament in the exact spot with the golf shirt and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=183.7s)]
*  the classified documents. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=188.42s)]
*  Things get moved around. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=189.42s)]
*  Right, but there's no standard for that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=190.42s)]
*  I don't even understand what the legal argument is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=192.46s)]
*  No, but they did keep integrity within the box, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=194.62s)]
*  So you know like everything, all the contents of this box were there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=198.46s)]
*  You just don't know the precise order of it, which there's no case law saying that you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=201.94s)]
*  have to. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=204.94s)]
*  But you know that these things were basically kept together and that is relevant for the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=205.94s)]
*  prosecutors, not for the defense because it shows, look how recklessly he maintained [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=209.74s)]
*  these materials. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=214.34s)]
*  The fact that they are strewn in with all of these personal items shows that he was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  not taking the care that needed to be taken with the classified material. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=221.38s)]
*  So we've, you know, Eileen Cannon has been running her little sort of like Supreme Court [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=224.94s)]
*  in Florida situation, you know, days of oral arguments. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=230.38s)]
*  Today was another day where they, again, this stuff could be done in motions practice. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=233.66s)]
*  I'm not an expert, but it seems like you don't need like days of oral arguments on this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=237.26s)]
*  But again, you know, sort of dressing down the Jack Smith prosecutor, I don't appreciate [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=242.38s)]
*  your tone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  All of this stuff being basically kind of still kept up in the air with no decisions [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=249.22s)]
*  on it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=254.12s)]
*  So nothing can be done with it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=255.12s)]
*  What's your sense of that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=258.3s)]
*  Well, at the end of the hearing today was the first time that I think there was a very [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=259.9s)]
*  unremarkable hearing on a very basic issue that could have been decided on the papers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=264.72s)]
*  One of Jack Smith's prosecutors said something remarkable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=269.36s)]
*  He called out this charade and he said the purpose, the defense strategy here is to just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=271.62s)]
*  cast dispersions on the government, on law enforcement. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=277.3s)]
*  Like, that's what we're doing here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=280.98s)]
*  They're just here to air their grievances publicly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=282.3s)]
*  And as the prosecutor is saying, that's not fair, she said thank you and concluded the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=284.74s)]
*  hearing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=289.62s)]
*  She didn't want to hear it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=290.62s)]
*  She shut it down. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=292.1s)]
*  But that's what's going on here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  It is political theater. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=295.1s)]
*  It's not really anything you would expect to be happening in a case. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=297.3s)]
*  Are these, I mean, so in some cases, right, with, with, let's say, immunity, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  In the immunity motion, there is a novel constitutional issue, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=307.38000000000005s)]
*  It's going to the Supreme Court and the Jan 6. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  But like, stuff gets taken all the, like, there are classified documents cases all the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=315.22s)]
*  time and there's search warrants executed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  I just, I don't actually understand how this motion makes any sense legally. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=321.18s)]
*  And is this pro forma? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Do defendants do this all the time? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  All the time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=330.82000000000005s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=331.82000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  So anytime there's a search warrant in a case, you can bet your bottom dollar that the defense [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  attorney, if he's worth the salt, is going to file a motion saying there was something [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=335.9s)]
*  wrong with the search warrant and therefore, you know, that agents acted improperly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  It was too broad and therefore, you know, they should get all the evidence that was [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=344.73999999999995s)]
*  seized should get thrown out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=348.5s)]
*  But here there was really no there there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=350.46s)]
*  Like they said, it's too broad. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=352.94s)]
*  And Cannon rightly said, well, but it's just seeking classified materials. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  And then they said, well, they went to too many different rooms. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=359.73999999999995s)]
*  They went to Melania's room. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=362.26s)]
*  They went to Baron's room. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=363.26s)]
*  And Cannon said, well, yeah, but they didn't get anything. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  So what's your prejudice? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=366.74s)]
*  What's the legal issue? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=367.74s)]
*  And by the way, that's a crazy argument for the defense to make considering the fact that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=368.74s)]
*  they were found in a ballroom and in a bathroom. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=371.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=373.94s)]
*  Why are you going all these crazy places when in fact, in the crazy places are when my favorite [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=374.94s)]
*  are the boxes that are behind. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=379.18s)]
*  And we have the bathroom shot, the one bathroom behind the tension rod that's running you [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  about one dollar ninety nine at your local store, the tension rod shower curtain. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=385.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=389.26s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's absurd. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=390.26s)]
*  So for them to even be raising these arguments, which again, on the papers, there are no facts [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=392.62s)]
*  here. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=397.14s)]
*  But really what they want to do with the defense is saying is we want to bring in the agents. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTothWNi7gw&t=398.14s)]
