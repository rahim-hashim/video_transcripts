# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc)
*  There is news tonight from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=0.0s)]
*  The D.C. court has agreed to rule as soon as it can on Donald Trump's claim that as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=5.96s)]
*  president he is immune from criminal prosecution for the crimes he is accused of committing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=11.16s)]
*  while in office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=15.68s)]
*  That two-page ruling signed by a George H.W. Bush nominated judge and two Biden nominees [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=17.28s)]
*  grants a request from special counsel Jack Smith for an expedited hearing on Trump's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=22.48s)]
*  immunity claim. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=27.68s)]
*  Normally that would be good news for a defendant. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=29.04s)]
*  Hey, your appeal is going to be heard quickly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=31.2s)]
*  For Trump, whose lawyers were pushing for a longer, slower appeals process in hope it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=33.68s)]
*  might postpone his January 6 trial until after the election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=39.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, Smith called Trump's bluff. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  He's also pursuing a parallel ruling on Trump's appeal not just in the D.C. appeals court, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=45.2s)]
*  which is normally where you go after this kind of thing, but all the way up to the Supreme [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Court. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=53.36s)]
*  And now Trump has to submit his arguments to both courts next week. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Kimi Daya Ogongo Williams, a former federal prosecutor who was senior investigative counsel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=58.56s)]
*  to the January 6 committee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  Donya Perry served as deputy New York state attorney general and as well as assistant [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=64.44s)]
*  U.S. attorney to the Southern District of New York, and they join me now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=68.4s)]
*  All right, I don't want to get too in the procedural weeds here because this is a very [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=70.92s)]
*  weird case, but basically Trump says at the district level, I was president, I'm immune. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  Judge Shutkin says, I don't buy it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=79.76s)]
*  She issues a ruling I found very persuasive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  So the next step up is D.C. court of appeals, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  So that's happening. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=86.4s)]
*  Jack Smith is also going to the Supreme Court and saying, hey, this is going to get to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=87.64s)]
*  you eventually. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=90.24s)]
*  Can we just get along with it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=91.24s)]
*  So those are both sort of happening right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=92.24s)]
*  But the D.C. court of appeals responding today and saying like, yeah, we can move this along. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=94.32s)]
*  Timi Daya, what do you make of that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=99.52s)]
*  I think they are taking this extremely seriously. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=101.0s)]
*  And I think it's important. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=103.44s)]
*  Judge Shutkin today stayed all the deadlines in the trial, which means the discovery deadlines, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  the pretrial motions, all the work that has to happen to prepare for the March 4 trial, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=111.2s)]
*  all on pause because of this appeal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=116.44s)]
*  But what great news for Jack Smith today is that because the appeals court is expediting, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=118.56s)]
*  Jack Smith is now on two tracks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=123.8s)]
*  He can win on the appeals court, but he's also prepping the Supreme Court to get that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=125.64s)]
*  potential victory there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=129.8s)]
*  Makes it more likely we have a trial next year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=131.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=132.96s)]
*  So that I mean, that was the one too today, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=133.96s)]
*  Judge can says, look, I have to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=134.96s)]
*  She's not vacating them, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=137.04s)]
*  She's not saying these are gone. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=138.68s)]
*  The trials not happening. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=140.68s)]
*  She's just saying it's all pause. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=141.68s)]
*  We've got to see how this turns out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=142.68s)]
*  And now the balls in the court of these appeals courts, Donnie. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And the big question here is like how fast you're going to move. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=146.2s)]
*  It does seem like the D.C. appellate court is signaling like we can go here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=148.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  As is the Supreme Court. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=153.6s)]
*  They very quickly agreed to expedite this process to determine whether or not they will [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=155.32s)]
*  allow this leapfrogging to happen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  So all of this is happening essentially next week with the next week or so. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see if they if they grant it, it will just skip over this process, go even [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=168.56s)]
*  more quickly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=172.44s)]
*  There's a funny thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=173.48s)]
*  I remember once it was it was in a Supreme Court argument, I believe, over a trap law. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=173.96s)]
*  It might have been Women's Whole Health, where, you know, before Roe v. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=179.24s)]
*  Wade was overturned, right, anti-abortion advocates would try to like create a bunch [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=183.64s)]
*  of like onerous regulations on abortion clinics. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=187.56s)]
*  It'd be like the hallways have to be eight feet wide. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=189.68s)]
*  And I remember this moment in Justice Kagan being like, do we have to pretend that you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=191.96s)]
*  guys actually care about this here? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=196.36s)]
*  Like, we know what you're there to do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  And I remember it's like so I loved it so much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=199.84s)]
*  Right. Because there's such a degree of law where like you're sort of presuming good [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=201.76s)]
*  faith. But this just seems like so obvious, the bad faith here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=205.52s)]
*  I mean, here's here's Trump's lawyers complaining about their Christmas vacations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=209.08s)]
*  Right. They this is their reply brief. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=213.84s)]
*  They say this proposed schedule will require attorneys and support staff to work around [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=216.8s)]
*  the clock through the holidays, inevitably disrupting family and travel plans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=221.12s)]
*  It is as if the special counsel growled with his grinch fingers nervously drumming, I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=224.72s)]
*  must find some way to keep Christmas from coming. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=228.72s)]
*  But how? And citation to Dr. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=230.84s)]
*  Seuss. Like, what are we doing here? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=232.72s)]
*  I mean, I got to say, it's almost a bit offensive. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=235.12s)]
*  It is. I think Jack Smith in every filing he's put forward has reminded the American [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=238.08s)]
*  people what is at stake, that we're dealing with a former president who directed violence, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=244.08s)]
*  who uses political process to undermine the transfer of power. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=249.32s)]
*  And when you have former President Trump's lawyers here citing children nursery rhymes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=252.56s)]
*  I think it really undermines the significance of what we're doing here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=258.48s)]
*  I'm also like, bro, I don't give a damn about your family vacation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm sorry. Like more at stake. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=267.56s)]
*  There's stuff happening here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=269.44s)]
*  It's really important. Like, it just seems like bizarre special pleading and whining. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  But again, the goal here is to delay. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you're to your point earlier. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=278.0s)]
*  Typically, if a defendant gets a bad ruling, they would like to move this forward faster, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=280.48s)]
*  rather than more slowly. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=286.76s)]
*  And so here it does kind of really betray the true colors here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=288.2s)]
*  They say again, and this is the Trump's lawyer brief, they say it's a blatant attempt to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=294.2s)]
*  interfere the 2024 presidential election to disenfranchise the tens of millions of voters [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=300.68s)]
*  who support President Trump's candidacy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=304.76s)]
*  It does seem to me that that explicit argument is going to be made increasingly up this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=306.8s)]
*  appeals chain. And I wonder if you think even justices coming from an ideological [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=312.56s)]
*  background more adjacent to Donald Trump or appointed by him are going to are going to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=318.96s)]
*  cotton to that argument. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=324.08s)]
*  Well, I think Jack Smith's response is a good one, which he's also focused on the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=325.64s)]
*  American people. What he's saying is that the American people have a right to this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=329.88s)]
*  answer. To know exactly. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=333.44s)]
*  So I think it actually is empowering the American people the way Jack Smith is framed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=335.32s)]
*  is that they should know whether the former president in fact engage in his conduct. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=338.48s)]
*  And frankly, if you were a defendant, what you want, that's typically right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=342.6s)]
*  You want to be absolved more quickly should be cleared before he appears stands for, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=346.32s)]
*  you know, for the trial. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=351.68s)]
*  Exactly. And if he truly is as innocent as he claims and he's going to he would want [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=353.6s)]
*  to have his day in court. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=358.68s)]
*  He would want to remove the shadow from his candidacy and go into November without it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=359.96s)]
*  So what are the things you're looking for again, because it's all this weird timing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=364.52s)]
*  game. Right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=368.08s)]
*  I mean, the actual outcome matters, although I think that the argument for immunity is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  so thin that I don't maybe you guys disagree with me, but I don't think anyone's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=372.72s)]
*  more on the same page. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=377.0s)]
*  Yeah, like it's just it's a ludicrous argument, honestly, that that what are you looking [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=377.68s)]
*  for next week as these sort of these deadlines start to come in, like what we're going to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  see happen. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=387.88000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's going to play. I mean, we'll see. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  There's a little bit of play, right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=391.48s)]
*  There's the the Supreme Court is getting briefs on the 20th. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=393.68s)]
*  Yep. Right. And then we have the 23rd for the for the Court of Appeals. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=398.92s)]
*  So it's you know, it's possible this Supreme Court could rule more quickly and then [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  bypass the Court of Appeals. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  We know what the arguments are. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=409.72s)]
*  Jack Smith said in his papers for the expedited appeal, we already know what the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  arguments and maybe, you know, too bad. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=416.24s)]
*  So sad if it bumps into your holiday plans. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=418.72s)]
*  But this is largely briefed already. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=421.44s)]
*  Yes, not going to be any new arguments. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  And so we I don't think there's going to be any real surprises. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=425.84s)]
*  And we'll see. You know, there's plenty of precedent, although it is a unique context. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=429.76s)]
*  Right. Can a former president be prosecuted criminally? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=434.84s)]
*  There's a lot of precedent in in favor of, you know, affirming that ruling. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=438.24s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, my colleague here at MSNBC who covers legal affairs for us, made the point. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=443.84s)]
*  She was she said, you know, the Supreme Court, to give one example, can move quickly [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=448.64s)]
*  when it wants to. And she talked about Bush v. Gore. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=454.44s)]
*  Right. Bush v. Gore was like, all of a sudden, they just like swooped in. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=456.32s)]
*  They're like, stop, stop counting. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=459.24s)]
*  We're going to like look at this an expedited review, which is to say, like, this is all [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=460.72s)]
*  volitional at some level. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=464.16s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, the Supreme Court is fully in control here. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=465.8s)]
*  And I think they are them and their law clerics are going to be fully considering the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=469.0s)]
*  wide range of possibilities here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=473.88s)]
*  They're going to be considering the political implications. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=475.44s)]
*  I mean, they may not put that on paper, but I guarantee you they're thinking what happens [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=477.44s)]
*  next. Whatever decision they make here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=482.0s)]
*  OK, I mean, I want to ask you one more question, but save it for next time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=484.52s)]
*  All right. It's a little bit of a procedural one, but it's thinking about it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=488.64s)]
*  Timmy Dio, Ganga Williams, Tanya Perry. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both. Good evening from New York. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=494.56s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. About two hours ago, the Republican controlled House of Representatives [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=501.52s)]
*  by a narrow nine vote margin entirely along party lines. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=506.24s)]
*  Every single Republican voter to start the impeachment process over. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=510.2s)]
*  Well, it's not really clear. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=515.28s)]
*  No one seems sure what exactly the charge is. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=517.72s)]
*  And to be clear, the bar for productive discourse out of this historically unproductive [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  Republican majority is as low as it gets. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=525.96s)]
*  I mean, this is the same House Republican majority that took 15 votes just to elect [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  a speaker of the House, the same Republican majority that fired that guy after only a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=532.04s)]
*  few months on the job and left the country without a speaker. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=536.12s)]
*  Second, aligned the presidency for three more weeks, the same Republican majority that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=538.8s)]
*  is constantly at risk of being torn asunder by internal strife led by extremists and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=542.88s)]
*  political nihilists with cultish devotion to the man who tried to destroy American [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=547.56s)]
*  democracy and is promising to do it again. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=552.12s)]
*  But even by that low, low standard, this impeachment inquiry is as transparently [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=555.64s)]
*  cynical as anything they've done yet. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=560.16s)]
*  They've been at this for nearly three years. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=563.52s)]
*  I mean, from the moment President Biden was sworn in, they were waiting to impeach him. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=565.48s)]
*  The facts could come later. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=569.8s)]
*  Here's the thing about many House Republicans. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=572.0s)]
*  It's important to understand they are just as adrift in the conspiracy fever swamp as [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=573.8s)]
*  the most extreme portions of the MAGA movement they represent. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=579.24s)]
*  So over the past couple of years, I think a bunch of them convinced themselves that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=582.32s)]
*  there really was some big smoking gun that would prove that Joe Biden was guilty of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=585.8s)]
*  grifting money from foreign governments, which I think is the charge of the again, not [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=592.2s)]
*  clear Joe Biden, a man who really quite famously was among the poorest men in all of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=595.84s)]
*  elected government. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=601.92s)]
*  The federal level for most of his tenure in Washington, that is the guy who they want [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=602.92s)]
*  to believe was not just corrupt, but like wildly, unprecedentedly corrupt in front of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=608.04s)]
*  everyone's faces while serving as vice president. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=614.32s)]
*  And no one, no one sniffed it out until now. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=617.48s)]
*  That's the story. That claim, I think it's fair to say, is astonishingly difficult to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=620.68s)]
*  believe, which is why Republicans have zeroed in on Biden's son, Hunter. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=627.12s)]
*  That's a man who is very publicly struggled with addiction and dysfunction for most of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=631.92s)]
*  his adult life. House Republicans have hounded the president's son, Hunter Biden, to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=636.72s)]
*  the ends of the earth for years. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=642.08s)]
*  And so he actually showed up to Washington today to make his case for himself. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=644.48s)]
*  I am here to testify at a public hearing today to answer any of the committee's legitimate [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=650.48s)]
*  questions. Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=656.08s)]
*  Expose their baseless inquiry or hear what I have to say. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=667.44s)]
*  What are they afraid of? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=675.36s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=678.32s)]
*  He's right. Republicans don't want an open process because that would risk exposing just [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  how titanically weak their case actually is. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=685.08s)]
*  Mr. Biden said that his father had no involvement in his business dealings, period. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=689.2s)]
*  How do you respond? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not what Devin Archer said. There was telephone phone calls, meetings, dinners, you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=695.52s)]
*  name it. We know what happened with barista in Ukraine in that December 4th through December [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=699.72s)]
*  9th time frame. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=703.36s)]
*  First of all, Devin Archer actually did say that they had no nothing to do with the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  business. So he's got that wrong. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=708.72s)]
*  But but get this. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=710.76s)]
*  Think about that clip we just played. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=712.24s)]
*  They are still in the year of our Lord, 2023, trying to make barista a thing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=713.68s)]
*  Barista. Now, in case you've forgotten what you're forgiven for doing, barista is the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=719.04s)]
*  widely debunked conspiracy theory that Donald Trump sent Rudy Giuliani to dig up in Ukraine. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=724.6s)]
*  That's the one that Trump tried to threaten Zelensky into pushing publicly, even though [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=731.36s)]
*  it was nonsense. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=738.4s)]
*  The actual high crime that Trump was impeached for the first time back in 2020, that's the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=740.6s)]
*  source of it. So here we are four years later, including nearly an entire year with the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=745.64s)]
*  Republican House majority supposedly investigating these claims. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=750.44s)]
*  And that's what they got. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=753.6s)]
*  They got the thrown away wrapper of a scandal from 2020. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=755.96s)]
*  They've got nothing. Don't take my word for it, though. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=763.44s)]
*  Ask Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=766.72s)]
*  I have no evidence of it, and I'm going to just follow the facts where they are. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=770.88s)]
*  And the facts haven't taken me to that point where I can say that the president's guilty [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=775.24s)]
*  of anything. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=780.6s)]
*  That's Chuck Grassley. That is not some never Trump rhino. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=782.24s)]
*  Chuck Grassley has been going after this stuff for years, too. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  If you still need convincing the case against Biden's is so thin as to be nonexistent, even [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  the weatherman on the Fox and Friends couch isn't buying it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=793.24s)]
*  Congressman, exit question for you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=797.6400000000001s)]
*  Have you found that they have you found evidence that anybody broke any laws? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=799.36s)]
*  You don't actually have any facts to that to that point. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=805.6400000000001s)]
*  There's no evidence that Joe Biden did anything illegally. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=808.84s)]
*  I heard you yesterday referred to them as a crime family, and this was organized crime. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=812.0s)]
*  So make it easy for us. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=817.4s)]
*  What was the crime? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=818.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, the crime is trading policy for for money. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=820.6s)]
*  Which policy? Well, we're going to get into that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=827.1600000000001s)]
*  Just you wait. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  Congressman James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, the guy leading the charge [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=832.9200000000001s)]
*  against Biden, that's their captain, my captain. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=836.68s)]
*  He has done such a poor job outlining his case that he is getting torched by Steve [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=839.56s)]
*  Ducey, of all people. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=844.7199999999999s)]
*  In fact, get this, Comer won't even go on Fox and Friends anymore. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=846.16s)]
*  He is hiding in his new safe space on an even more MAGA network. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=849.9599999999999s)]
*  Why would Ducey say if all the work you've done that you have nothing? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=855.16s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=859.92s)]
*  Well, he's been this he's had that position from the very beginning. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  Quit going on Fox and Friends because of Ducey. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=864.96s)]
*  Why would that mean Ducey, father of Ducey, do you like that? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=869.32s)]
*  If your case is so thin that it won't even stand up to the soft focus scrutiny of Fox and Friends, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=874.72s)]
*  I think it might be time to admit that you just don't have the goods. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  But of course, James Comer and Jim Jordan and the rest of the MAGA caucus, I think those folks [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=882.9200000000001s)]
*  know they don't have the goods at this point. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=888.0s)]
*  They understand as well as anyone how flimsy this case is. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=891.48s)]
*  But they're going to do it anyway for one reason and one reason only. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=894.88s)]
*  Donald Trump wants them to do it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=898.2s)]
*  I rise to oppose this perverse illegitimate effort to do Donald Trump's political dirty work. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=901.84s)]
*  We're here today not because of any wrongdoing by President Biden, but because Donald Trump wants revenge. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=906.64s)]
*  Welcome to the Donald Trump revenge show. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=912.6800000000001s)]
*  This has never been about the truth. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=915.36s)]
*  This is about avenging Donald Trump. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=918.44s)]
*  The problem is they have zero evidence. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  The only crime is that Joe Biden blew out Donald Trump in the 2020 election. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  There is a through line to all of this. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=929.96s)]
*  Donald Trump will violate the law and constitution to gain power and to keep it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElSVOiKkHc&t=932.48s)]
