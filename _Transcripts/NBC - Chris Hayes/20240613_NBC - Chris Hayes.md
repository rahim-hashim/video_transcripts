# Justice Clarence Thomas received even more secret luxury gifts, new probe reveals
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM)
*  Surprise! There are even more undisclosed private jet trips. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we're learning that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas took at least three private jet trips, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=4.0s)]
*  paid for by his very generous benefactor, billionaire Republican Harlan Crowe, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=9.0s)]
*  according to an ongoing investigation by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=15.0s)]
*  Tonight, ProPublica is reporting the newly revealed flights add to the picture of Thomas' frequent use of Crowe's jet for personal travel, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=20.0s)]
*  allowing the Justice to fly in the style of the ultra-wealthy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=27.0s)]
*  Crowe owns a high-end Bumberdeer Global 5000, a jet that can cost over $10,000 per flight hour to charter, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=30.0s)]
*  according to the Charter Company estimates, and Thomas has repeatedly flown to a destination backing it on the same day. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=39.0s)]
*  That sounds like a nice way to go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=45.0s)]
*  In his statement, Thomas' lawyer said the trips, quote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=47.0s)]
*  fell under the personal hospitality exemption and was not required to be disclosed. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=49.0s)]
*  Justin Elliott is one of the reporters from ProPublica who broke the story [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=54.0s)]
*  and many other stories about the undisclosed gifts to both Justice Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=58.0s)]
*  He and the rest of his team at ProPublica won a Pulitzer for their reporting on the Supreme Court last year, and he joins me now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=63.0s)]
*  Congratulations on that Pulitzer, by the way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=67.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=69.0s)]
*  Well-earned. All right, three more trips. What have we learned? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about this that's so striking to me is just the scale of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=72.0s)]
*  I mean, we're really looking at a picture where Harlan Crowe's private jet, as you said, Global 5000, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=76.0s)]
*  which I'm told is a particularly nice type of private jet, was just at the disposal of Justice Thomas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=81.0s)]
*  I mean, there's multiple incidents where, for example, flying from Washington, D.C. to San Jose, California, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=87.0s)]
*  staying there for a few hours and then turning around and going back in the same day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=93.0s)]
*  That's happened repeatedly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=97.0s)]
*  And we see the jet going from where it's based in Dallas to D.C. to pick up the Justice. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=98.0s)]
*  And so this adds to a very long list. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=103.0s)]
*  And I think the picture is you have a billionaire political donor really in a real way subsidizing the life of a justice. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. And basically, I mean, the New Deal deals, they don't make clear the purpose of the trip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=112.0s)]
*  They include a May 27 trip to St. Louis from St. Louis to Kalispel, Montana, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=116.0s)]
*  location of Glacier Park International Airport, then from Montana to Dallas. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=120.0s)]
*  Two days later, you scheduled to be in St. Louis at the time for a speech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=124.0s)]
*  In one instance, he flew from the East Coast to San Jose, returned home later that day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=127.0s)]
*  Another he took a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Savannah, Georgia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, this is the kind of thing you only really get to do if you're a billionaire. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=135.0s)]
*  Just like, you know, this is how like Taylor Swift or Elon Musk. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=139.0s)]
*  That's how they get around. Right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=142.0s)]
*  I mean, the San Jose round trip alone again, seemingly for maybe some kind of lunch. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=144.0s)]
*  We don't know what it was for still. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=147.0s)]
*  That could easily cost well over one hundred thousand dollars. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=149.0s)]
*  Just just the flight. So, you know, probably double the median income that an American makes in a year. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=152.0s)]
*  It's it's it's an extraordinary amount of money. And this is on top of our flight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah. And last week, you know, Justice Thomas actually, after some of our reporting, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=162.0s)]
*  amended some prior years financial disclosure forms to disclose other things that Harlan Crowe has paid for hotels [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=167.0s)]
*  and lodging and a vacation in Indonesia, a trip to California. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=174.0s)]
*  And that's the third time he's done that in the last 10 or 15. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=178.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, these three ones no one knew about and no one reported. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, these are totally new to us. I mean, you had no idea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=184.0s)]
*  I had no idea. I mean, you know, but I'm pretty sure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=187.0s)]
*  Let me just say this is it. Right. I mean, this has to be totally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=190.0s)]
*  There's no way there's anything else. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=193.0s)]
*  I think we have an absolute definitive accounting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=195.0s)]
*  I mean, look, some of the reporting we did, it took, you know, myself and some coworkers months of reporting to piece together [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=197.0s)]
*  these trips and other gifts that Justice Thomas and Justice Alito also got. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=204.0s)]
*  We don't have subpoena power. The Senate Judiciary Committee does. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=208.0s)]
*  They said today that there's going to be a fuller report of their findings of this investigation coming out in the summer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=212.0s)]
*  So I would not at all be surprised if there's more revelations in that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=218.0s)]
*  They subpoenaed Leonard Leo as well, who basically told him to like go pound sand, pound sand. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=222.0s)]
*  Thank you for stopping me from saying what I was going to say to go pound sand. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=230.0s)]
*  And I don't know what's happening there, but Harlan Crowe, they subpoenaed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=234.0s)]
*  He's he's cooperating right there, getting this from Harlan Crowe, I think. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=237.0s)]
*  Right. This is this is from Harlan Crowe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=240.0s)]
*  What happened was they authorized the subpoena, didn't actually issue it, and it became sort of a leverage in their negotiations with his lawyers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=242.0s)]
*  And they came to this deal where he he's given them information about the last seven years, potentially not just travel, potentially other things, too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=248.0s)]
*  I think we'll only find out when the full investigation comes out later this summer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=256.0s)]
*  We're going to have to update our bar chart. Can we show the bar chart? My favorite bar chart. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=260.0s)]
*  It's a tough one to read. It's really hard to see when. Let's see, which one is Thomas? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=264.0s)]
*  Let me scan there. All right. There he is on the left. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=268.0s)]
*  So we might we might have to we might need to raise up that bar after we we we price these these ones in. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=270.0s)]
*  Maybe this summer we'll get more pricing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=278.0s)]
*  Can I get can I get your responses? I have you here to something Justice Alito said about your reporting because he talks about you and I want you to be able to respond directly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=281.0s)]
*  This is something that he said recently, surreptitiously recorded of our public. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=289.0s)]
*  There are groups that are very well funded. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=294.0s)]
*  I have a lot of experience. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=299.0s)]
*  I have spirit. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=303.0s)]
*  So I do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=305.0s)]
*  Sorry, I'm going to get some lot of gets a lot of money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=309.0s)]
*  And they have spent a fortune investigating. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=314.0s)]
*  Have you spent a fortune on are these ideological attacks? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=318.0s)]
*  What you're doing? Yeah, I mean, it was frankly disturbing to hear this because it's pure speculation based on no evidence as one of the two or three reporters that did this work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=321.0s)]
*  I can tell you how it started, which was not we're going to report on Justice Thomas and Justice Alito. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=331.0s)]
*  It was we're going to report on how Supreme Court justices are spending their time when they're not at the court. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=335.0s)]
*  Started with a stack of documents of travel records, no names of the justices. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=342.0s)]
*  And we pieced together that it was Justice Thomas who was taking private jets around. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=347.0s)]
*  We took a hard look at some of the Democratic appointed justices and just have simply not found anything equivalent. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=352.0s)]
*  Well, again, if we could put up that bar chart just for a second again, it is hard to find the signal from the noise in that chart. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=358.0s)]
*  You know, just it is it takes a real it takes a lot of energy just to uncover that one on the left. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=365.0s)]
*  You know, right. I mean, if if somebody out there knows about George Soros funding justice, I would be I would love to report it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=371.0s)]
*  And you can find my contact information on all of our stories. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the scoop. Great reporting. Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=383.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVVbfeYbbM&t=394.0s)]
