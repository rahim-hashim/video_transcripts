# ‘Weak leader’: Trump ‘hemorrhaging political capital,’ says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g)
*  The president-elect, the technical one, makes a big deal about how powerful he is, how everyone jumps to do his bidding, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=0.0s)]
*  everyone wants to be his friend, but the events the last 48 hours sure don't make him look very strong. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=5.18s)]
*  In fact, the opposite. First, he never took the initiative on the spending bill. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=9.5s)]
*  He just watched his co-president kill the deal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=13.86s)]
*  Then he tried to claim credit for it, and then he tried to command everyone in no uncertain terms in his party to vote for the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=16.44s)]
*  replacement bill [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=23.02s)]
*  only for 38 Republicans to vote against it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=24.54s)]
*  Then more threats. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=27.7s)]
*  This all comes on the heels of two of his nominees failing before they even got a hearing and more facing serious uphill battles to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=29.22s)]
*  confirmation, not to mention a 41% approval rate before he's even sworn in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=35.62s)]
*  I gotta say, Donald Trump has proven himself to be extremely resilient and a formidable political opponent, no question. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=41.18s)]
*  But this does not seem like an unbeatable colossus at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=48.78s)]
*  This seems like actually a pretty weak leader who is hemorrhaging political capital. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=51.68s)]
*  Fash Keir is a former senior advisor to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=56.82s)]
*  He's currently the executive director of More Perfect Union and a senior advisor to Senator Bernie Sanders, and he joins me now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=60.28s)]
*  What's your read on that thesis? That he's actually pretty politically weak right now, or weaker than I think I would have guessed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=65.44s)]
*  four weeks ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=72.16s)]
*  And I would add to that that he seems scared of Elon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=73.4s)]
*  And that's something you tend to see, right, in Trump who is in friction and in fights with people who cross him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=76.76s)]
*  Certainly that was the purpose of the statement yesterday, right, the threatening of primaries and all that kinds of stuff. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=82.94s)]
*  That's what he does to people who cross him who aren't on the same page with him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=88.34s)]
*  You didn't hear much about him and Elon, even though now there's reports, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  rumors circulating that he's not even very happy with this bill that's passed now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=97.18s)]
*  But he's not saying anything about Elon. Elon worked him, right, when that period, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=101.18s)]
*  you remember that period of time where he just rushed out to Twitter with his own platform, Elon did, and announced and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=105.22s)]
*  proceeded to tell the nation what the policy of Trump slash Elon Musk's regime is. And there was nothing, there was silence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=110.94s)]
*  And it's funny because you think of Trump's weakness. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  When CR 2.0 came right after the first one failed, he rushed out to declare, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm in favor of this because I think he had gotten worked by Elon the first time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=127.02s)]
*  So he looks scared and he looks weak, to your point. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  So on that, I think it was Burgess Everett reporting that Trump is not happy, capital N-O-T, that the spending deal doesn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=133.78s)]
*  include the debt ceiling, according to the person who spoke with him this PM. Not clear, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=139.38s)]
*  he'll probably try to stop the bill in the Senate, but the bill doesn't contain his main ask. And to that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=142.54s)]
*  I mean, I want to go back to what he said yesterday, right? No uncertain terms. This is him like using the megaphone, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=147.14s)]
*  This is supposed to be the dear leader jump-how-high. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=152.54s)]
*  If Republicans try to pass a clean, continuing resolution without all the Democrat bells and whistles [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=155.1s)]
*  that would be so destructive to our country, all we'll do after January 20th is bring the mess of the debt limit [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=159.66s)]
*  into the Trump administration rather than allowing it to take place in the Biden administration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=164.9s)]
*  Any Republican that would be so stupid as to do this should and will be primaried. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=168.22s)]
*  Everything should be done and fully negotiated prior to my taking office on January 20th, 2025. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=173.38s)]
*  They all just ignored it. They laughed it off. Nothing. That was just like, yeah, whatever. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=179.06s)]
*  I was also thinking, but you mentioned in the prior segment, the pharmacy benefit managers, the PBMs, did literally five days ago. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=183.66s)]
*  It was four days ago. He was at his own press conference and he said, we're gonna kill the middleman. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=189.78s)]
*  We're gonna go after these PBMs. He lets Elon dictate. No, that's gotta come out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=193.9s)]
*  Then he lets Elon dictate the pediatric cancer research and breast cancer research and sickle cell and down research. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=198.94s)]
*  All that's gotta come out. He let him dictate the terms even of things that he was proclaiming just like literally days ago [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=204.18s)]
*  that he was for. He is no longer driving this car. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=211.86s)]
*  And I think, you know, to your point that you just raised here, House Republicans are more scared of Elon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=215.9s)]
*  It's clear now in the future when they're looking ahead to the next four years, not worried about the primary of Donald Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=220.42s)]
*  They're worried about, is Elon gonna dump money into my into my election? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=225.54s)]
*  Well, and there was always this question, right, about what would it be like? We haven't done this since Grover Cleveland, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=228.82s)]
*  What is it? What does it mean to be sworn in as a lame duck? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=234.38s)]
*  And back then, of course, we didn't have a constitutional amendment with term limits, right? There's just a norm. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, now it's so this question of what does it mean to be sworn in and be a lame duck immediately? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=243.78s)]
*  We haven't grappled with them for. And the other thing I think that's happening here, I want to get your thoughts on this is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=249.58s)]
*  there's actually an ideological conflict. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=254.06s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't care about spending and the deficits. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=256.94s)]
*  In fact, a huge innovation he brought that was very politically advantageous to the Republican Party was like, get rid of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=260.02s)]
*  Ryan budget stuff and the House Freedom Caucus and the Tea Party stuff. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=266.66s)]
*  No one cares about that stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=269.98s)]
*  And I think that was hugely beneficial. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=271.5s)]
*  It's been an enormous Elon Musk seems like he and the House Freedom Caucus are just bringing all of those politics back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=273.38s)]
*  And when you had a choice between the two of them in the last 24 hours, it's the Elon Musk Tea Party version that won. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=280.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's the interest also of a billionaire class. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=288.58s)]
*  When you think about the things that they desperately want, it is the corporate tax rates, the raising of the debt ceiling, those kinds [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=291.38s)]
*  of things, which I think Elon is also pointing towards of the future. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  It's not, you know, as you're saying, expanding government spending into key areas and domains of the next, you know, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  administration, which Trump has made some promises of things that he's going to do for middle class working class people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=308.58000000000004s)]
*  That's not aligned with where Elon's thinking what a billionaire class really wants. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a constrained government that only does privatization, which we're now going to get. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=317.42s)]
*  But one of the biggest important things that we learned from this is there are the agreement, apparently, right, Chris? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=323.42s)]
*  There's a permanent agreement to cut to two and a half trillion in Medicare's mandatory spending, which is obviously only [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=327.14000000000004s)]
*  Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  What are you going to you can't cut that much money and obviously going to go right at it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's supposed to happen in January. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=338.42s)]
*  This is a this is to your point. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=339.82000000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk's vision, not Donald Trump's. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=341.22s)]
*  Fash, Shakir. Always a pleasure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=344.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLq7vy3o4g&t=345.74s)]
