# ‘Sleaziest thing ever': George Conway rips Trump, RNC chair for Michigan phone call
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I)
*  Even as special counsel Jack Smith prepares to take Donald Trump to trial over his attempts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=0.0s)]
*  to steal the 2020 election, we are still learning new details three years later about the lengths [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=4.5s)]
*  the ex-president went to. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=9.8s)]
*  As we've covered on the show before, back in November 2020, two Republican election [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=11.5s)]
*  officials in Wayne County, Michigan initially refused to certify President Biden's victory [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=16.32s)]
*  there before changing their minds, voting to certify and ending the standoff. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=22.12s)]
*  Just 30 minutes after that meeting ended, Trump called the two officials, urging them [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=26.26s)]
*  to reverse course again and go back to blocking Biden's victory. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Now we know, finally, what Trump said on that call, thanks to great reporting by the Detroit [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=34.7s)]
*  News. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=39.34s)]
*  Joined by none other than RNC Chair Ronna Romney-McDaniel, Trump promised to provide [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=40.34s)]
*  attorneys for the two officials. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  He also told the pair they would look, quote, terrible if they signed the official certification [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  document, adding, quote, we've got to fight for our country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=51.74s)]
*  We can't let these people take our country away from us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=54.94s)]
*  Following the call, the two canvassers then did try to do what Trump asked and undo their [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=58.98s)]
*  vote to certify Biden's victory. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=63.42s)]
*  Thankfully, the plan did not work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=65.42s)]
*  The ship had sailed, as it were. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=67.52s)]
*  Notably, when pressed about the calls three years ago, because we knew calls were happening, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=69.66s)]
*  one of the election officials, Monica Palmer, said Trump was merely checking in on her well-being. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=73.58s)]
*  The portions of the call reviewed by the Detroit News did not include comments by Trump to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=81.02s)]
*  that effect. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  We should note, NBC News has not independently verified these recordings, but as the Detroit [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  News notes, neither Palmer nor McDaniel and Trump, through spokespeople, disputed a summary [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=91.02s)]
*  of the call when contacted by the news. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  The second Wayne County canvasser, William Hartman, died in 2021. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=98.5s)]
*  Joining me now are Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal analyst and George Conway, conservative attorney. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=103.5s)]
*  There's a lot to talk about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about the sort of new revelations coming out of Michigan and what they could [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  mean, particularly what they might mean for both Jack Smith's case and other state-based [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=112.54s)]
*  cases. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=116.3s)]
*  But also, because we've got this Supreme Court denial of cert before judgment, I want to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=117.3s)]
*  get your reactions to it because we've been sort of asking different legal folks what [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  they think. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  George, if I'm not mistaken, you worked on the Jones v. Clinton brief on the side of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  Paula Jones, which was an immunity case in a civil context saying President Clinton should [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=131.74s)]
*  have to sit for a deposition. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=136.9s)]
*  He was not entitled to immunity. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=138.82s)]
*  You guys won that case 9-0, so you know immunity doctrine at the Supreme Court. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=140.3s)]
*  What do you make of this cert petition denial? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the only person I think in the universe who's written a brief that's defeated a claim [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=146.94s)]
*  of presidential immunity. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=151.22s)]
*  You know, nothing, I think. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=152.22s)]
*  And I think today's order is not a big deal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=154.1s)]
*  I see a lot of people, their hair is on fire. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=158.1s)]
*  They can just douse their hair in water because this isn't a big deal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's really going to affect the trial date that much. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  The worst case is the trial gets pushed to the summer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=168.1s)]
*  And the reason is I think this order shows the weakness of Trump's immunity case. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=171.42s)]
*  And I think the court realizes it's got the D.C. circuit that's going to basically hear [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  argument on January 9th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=183.26s)]
*  It's not a hard case. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  I think they're going to move very quickly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  If I were the presiding judge of the panel, I'd already be writing the opinion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=187.5s)]
*  And once they rule, they can lift the stay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=191.06s)]
*  They can issue a mandate and list the stay, which means then you're going to have Donald [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=193.34s)]
*  Trump saying, oh, we need an expedition. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  We need an expedition. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  And the Supreme Court could grant that and hear the case. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  They could hear it in April and May, decide it in June, decide it in May. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=202.34s)]
*  You still have a summer trial. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=205.5s)]
*  Or better yet, they could deny the case, sir, because he's already had his argument in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=207.3s)]
*  court of appeals before a very, very distinguished panel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=213.3s)]
*  And he can, Donald Trump should be, frankly, treated like every other criminal who's been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  convicted in a federal district court and be forced to litigate his arguments after [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=221.62s)]
*  his conviction. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=227.34s)]
*  And he can challenge his conviction with every other claim after he's convicted and sentenced. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=229.1s)]
*  So I just don't think this is a big deal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=233.74s)]
*  I think this case is going to get tried one way or the other in April, May, June, July. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=235.66s)]
*  This case is going to trial, and Donald Trump is not going to be able to stop it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=241.06s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=246.26s)]
*  I mean, there's a few things, Lisa, that are interesting to me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=247.26s)]
*  Andrew Weissman talked about just sort of professional courtesy and deference from the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=249.94s)]
*  Supreme Court to the D.C. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=253.54s)]
*  Circuit, which, of course, is sort of the first among equals in the valid courts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=254.66s)]
*  It's sitting right there in D.C. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=258.82s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=260.38s)]
*  There's the advantage of, to George's point, what I think is interesting is when you've [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=261.38s)]
*  got something that is pretty clear-cut, rather than having one quite clear-cut opinion in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  which Judge Shutkin says, not a tough call, to have two opinions that say, this is not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=269.98s)]
*  a tough call, and then take that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=276.14s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=278.74s)]
*  Look, Chris, to the extent that the Trump brief was persuasive here, I think it was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=279.74s)]
*  persuasive on the point that Judge Shutkin's opinion denying immunity for criminal prosecution [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=285.34s)]
*  where you're talking about a sitting or former president is the first of its kind. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=291.26s)]
*  And Trump's brief argued, you, Supreme Court, should want to have another body of law before [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=295.82s)]
*  you make this most important of decisions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=300.9s)]
*  We're not disagreeing that this eventually warrants your review. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=303.78s)]
*  We're just saying not now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=306.98s)]
*  But I thought that was probably the most persuasive argument in their brief. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=308.62s)]
*  In terms of what I think the D.C. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  Circuit is going to do, I tend to think that this D.C. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=314.34s)]
*  Circuit is going to make a decision on immunity that's more symmetrical with the rule in civil [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=317.14s)]
*  cases and say, yes, maybe a president is entitled to immunity where you're talking about allegedly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=322.46s)]
*  criminal actions at the outer periphery of their official duties. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  But based on the allegations in this indictment, taking them on their face, what they are alleging [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=332.86s)]
*  that he did doesn't even get close to that periphery and therefore the case can be tried. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=338.18s)]
*  I think they want the cover of a D.C. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=342.7s)]
*  Circuit opinion that says that based on a decision earlier this month in a civil context [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=344.74s)]
*  in the D.C. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=350.22s)]
*  Circuit, I think the D.C. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=351.22s)]
*  Circuit is well positioned to extend that rule of the criminal context and give the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=352.22s)]
*  court the cover that it needs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=355.94s)]
*  Yeah, this is the outer perimeter sort of doctrine that is both sort of, I think, suggested [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=357.58s)]
*  in this line and also explicitly invoked in the Trump brief. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=364.02s)]
*  George, let's talk about what's coming out of Michigan because there's a few things striking [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=369.02s)]
*  about it to me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=373.74s)]
*  One is that, I don't know, where did they get the tape from? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=374.74s)]
*  And now we've got the tape. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  But also just like it's so wild how in the weeds the guy was. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's the president of the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=382.58s)]
*  Like, you know this because you have worked, you've worked in politics and you've been [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=384.74s)]
*  around the various layers that go around principles, as they're often called, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=388.26s)]
*  Who they talk to on the phone. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=395.26s)]
*  What's a staff job? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=396.62s)]
*  What's the principal's job? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=397.62s)]
*  Like, the president on the phone with the wing canvassers, it's just like there's nothing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=398.9s)]
*  he won't do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=404.5s)]
*  There's no links he won't go to to get this done. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=406.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's a complete nut job. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=409.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's just like what he did in Georgia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=411.7s)]
*  Remember, he didn't just call Secretary of State Raffensperger, he called an investigator. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=414.78s)]
*  A lowly investigator in the Georgia Department of whatever. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  I didn't even know what it is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  And to jawbone that poor woman, she's getting talkies of the president of the United States [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=427.14s)]
*  nut job. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just crazy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=433.34s)]
*  It just shows you what a lunatic he is and how extreme he is and how corrupt he is. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  Because this is just, he's basically on the basis of lies, on the basis of no facts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=439.7s)]
*  He's urging a public official to basically violate their oath to the law of the state [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=444.26s)]
*  of Michigan and to the Constitution. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=450.14s)]
*  It's crazy and corrupt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=452.02s)]
*  And I got to say this about my former political party. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=453.86s)]
*  You know, I mean, Ronon Romney McDaniel, the woman who changed her name so that wouldn't [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  displease Donald Trump. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=462.02s)]
*  I mean, I mean, this is just the sleaziest thing ever. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  Whether or not it's criminal, we'll set that aside. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  It's just the sleaziest thing ever. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=468.38s)]
*  And if my former political party had any decency or shame, she'd be out on her ass. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=470.14s)]
*  Forgive my language. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=476.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it is. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=477.97999999999996s)]
*  I do find it actually quite revealing and shocking that she's on the call and she's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=480.06s)]
*  saying, we'll pay for your lawyers as well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=485.7s)]
*  There's also an interesting angle to this, Lisa, which is we have seen, and I think there's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=487.7s)]
*  a sort of a little bit of a Fonny Willis effect, which is, you know, all eyes were on the Justice [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=492.18s)]
*  Department from the beginning of this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=497.82s)]
*  But it's pretty clear that there are all sorts of colorable claims in a bunch of jurisdictions [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=499.7s)]
*  that state law was violated. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  And now we've seen cases brought against, you know, the sort of fake electors in Michigan. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=506.14000000000004s)]
*  There's a case now in Nevada. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=511.54s)]
*  There's maybe one coming in Arizona. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=513.14s)]
*  There is the one in Georgia that names them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=515.46s)]
*  There were alongside with the federal case and the Fonny Willis case, there were many [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=518.38s)]
*  state laws that plausibly were broken in pursuit of this scheme. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=522.34s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=528.54s)]
*  And we now know, Chris, based on this reporting, that there were at least four recorded calls. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=530.54s)]
*  There are the two calls that George was mentioning earlier in Georgia to Brad Raffensperger and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=535.7s)]
*  the woman who was the investigator. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=540.18s)]
*  Her name is Frances Watson. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=541.18s)]
*  Then there was the call that just got reported in Michigan. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=543.42s)]
*  And I also want to remind you that there's a fourth call to now deceased Georgia House [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=545.9s)]
*  Speaker David Ralston, who provided a copy of that recording to the special purpose grand [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=549.98s)]
*  jury that Fonny Willis convened. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=554.62s)]
*  So we now know that this guy who infamously doesn't text, doesn't email was foiled by [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=556.8s)]
*  the smartphone era and by a bunch of quick thinking folks who, when he made these very [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=562.8399999999999s)]
*  granular, weedy calls to the Wayne County commissioners, fired up the phone and fired [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  the otter, I guess, to record him having these conversations, giving rise to, as you note, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=571.88s)]
*  potentially some state law claims, but also additional evidence of the wrongdoing in Jack [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=577.76s)]
*  Smith's case. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  Also, you're firing up the recorder, the iPhone recorder, not because you're like, this is [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  a cool souvenir. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=590.88s)]
*  You're firing it up as Brad Raffensperger because like, this is really legally objectionable. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  And I immediately need some evidence to cover myself from what might be a blatant act of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=598.0s)]
*  criminality. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=604.72s)]
*  I think that's fairly clear. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=605.72s)]
*  If I were going into a phone call with a criminal, I would record it too. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=606.72s)]
*  And let me, there's one other thing too. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  We forget about the one other call, the one that almost happened. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=613.48s)]
*  Remember, Governor Doug Ducey, when he was signing the electoral certificates, he's sitting [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=616.6s)]
*  there, the press is there, they're taking the pictures and all of a sudden his phone [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=622.52s)]
*  rings in his pocket, it's hail to the chief. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  He takes his phone out of his pocket and puts it down and turns it off. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Trump is completely insane. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  I forgot that detail. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  One thing about the state laws, I mean, here it's, I think the one wrinkle to this particular [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=640.24s)]
*  case, I think if I were the defense lawyers here for Ronna, Romney, McDaniel and Donald [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=646.04s)]
*  Trump and whoever, the thing they got going for them is that these people had already [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  certified the results and they didn't have the power to uncertify it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=656.16s)]
*  So in a sense, they were being asked to do something they couldn't do and that could [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=661.28s)]
*  affect the legal effect of what they did. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  But other than that, it's just sleazy as hell and it can be used in Jack Smith's case, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=669.56s)]
*  which I think can go to trial in March and April, as I said, and in Fannie Willis' case [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=675.56s)]
*  to show their criminal intent. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK6XDdx-j1I&t=680.1999999999999s)]
