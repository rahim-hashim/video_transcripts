# Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost on the May jobs report ‘The numbers don’t lie — things are great’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk)
*  It is jobs report Friday, which means it's time for us to check in on Maria Bartiromo over on Fox Business. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=0.0s)]
*  The number is out. We want to get the details on this. This is something. This is something. 272,000. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=6.4s)]
*  Nancy Lazar was right. She was right. 272,000. Everybody, the estimate was 185,000. And by the way, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=15.76s)]
*  that blows even the top of the range from economists going in. The range was 120 to 258, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  and we came in at 272. The unemployment rate hit 4%. The estimate was 3.9%. So these, wow, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=32.56s)]
*  this is something else. Once again, another incredible jobs report, which of course means [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=41.68s)]
*  once again, Maria Bartiromo has to try to find something wrong. Well, you know what number I [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=46.24s)]
*  don't like, Charles, is this wages. The wages average hourly earnings up 4.1%. That points to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=51.92s)]
*  inflation, Charles, a couple of days before we get the CPI on Wednesday. Here's the thing. Even [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=60.56s)]
*  that number is actually pretty good. Those wage gains are actually outpacing the latest inflation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=65.6s)]
*  data. Not only that, prime age labor force participation, folks aged 25 to 54, is the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=69.44s)]
*  highest it's been in more than two decades. And of course, today's job numbers, as you heard from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=74.56s)]
*  our friends over at Fox Business, exceeded everyone's expectations. The economy under [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=79.84s)]
*  Joe Biden in macroeconomic terms is literally the best economy I've seen in my lifetime. So why is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=84.72s)]
*  it not seeming to register with voters? Joining me here at the table to talk about that, among [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=89.6s)]
*  other things, Congressman Maxwell Frost, Democrat of Florida, who serves on the 2024 Biden campaign, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=94.32s)]
*  National Advisory Board. What's your read on the state of the economy? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=99.12s)]
*  Well, the numbers don't lie, right? Things are great. And the president is really landing this, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  especially post pandemic. I think that the folks aren't feeling it, which is very valid. Folks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=108.64s)]
*  are thinking about the high prices of things. And that doesn't really have to do with the president [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  as much as it do with corporate greed and these monopolies we've seen. And the president understands [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  that. That's why he's doing stuff on junk fees. That's why the FTC is one of the most aggressive [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=124.8s)]
*  FTCs we've seen under Carolina Khan. They're doing good work and good antitrust work. President [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump, he believed that giving handouts to billionaires was the way to help working families. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=134.72s)]
*  And President Biden knows that that's not it. Resources to working families is what's going to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=138.96s)]
*  help us here. You know, one of the things I think, and just to zoom in on the jobs, let's show the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=143.04s)]
*  Trump versus Biden jobs, which is really remarkable. Jobs created per year since 2017, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=148.96s)]
*  Trump versus Biden, 2.1 million in the first year. It loses 9.27 in 2020, of course, of the pandemic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=156.72s)]
*  Joe Biden comes back, gains a huge number of jobs, 7.25. And then after that, a very, very strong [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=167.68s)]
*  growth. So you see that sort of huge, huge, huge difference between the two. But even if you just [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=175.12s)]
*  say, okay, fine, take out the pandemic, take out 2020, take out 2021. That was the pandemic and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=180.32s)]
*  the recovery. You still have the Joe Biden presidency outpacing Donald Trump and job creation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=186.08s)]
*  On the point of costs, it seems to me part of the issue too is that housing costs, which are a huge [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=193.12s)]
*  issue for folks, those are not really being driven by the president's policy. They're being driven [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=198.08s)]
*  by local policy in the Fed. And so people feel that maybe they think Biden's responsible, but [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=203.44s)]
*  it's not coming from him. No, exactly. And this is part of the reason the president's been focusing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=209.76s)]
*  a lot on junk fees and figuring out how are we going to help renters? How are we going to help [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=214.0s)]
*  people buy and accumulate wealth by housing? I have a bill, the End Junk Fees for Renters Act, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=217.28s)]
*  which works at banning junk fees. Once a junk fee, something your landlord has to provide for you [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=222.8s)]
*  that they're charging extra for you. I mean, I just moved into a place recently. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=227.2s)]
*  You were having a hard time last time. When you moved to Washington, you were having a hard time [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=232.24s)]
*  finding a place to rent. Credit scores, which my bill also works at banning credit scores. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=236.24s)]
*  How were your credit scores? Not good. Because during the campaign, I was Ubering to make ends [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=239.76s)]
*  meet, running up credit card debt, having a hard time paying it back because I couldn't make that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=244.72s)]
*  money because I was also running for Congress. And this is an issue that so many Americans face. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=249.2s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is during COVID and during those Trump policies, the marketplace and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=254.08s)]
*  our power as consumers in the marketplace went down by a lot. And so President Biden is working [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=259.52s)]
*  at fixing that wrong. But corporate greed is really what's driving this right now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=264.79999999999995s)]
*  One of the things that we're seeing in your state, particularly on a high cost, which has been a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=269.68s)]
*  story I've been following, I'm just curious how much this is affecting folks in your district, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=275.12s)]
*  is insurance, homeowners insurance, particularly in the state of Florida. And we're seeing it in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=279.2s)]
*  Texas and to a certain amount in California. There's a bunch of different reasons for that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  climate being a huge part of it. What are you hearing about people in Florida about that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=287.44s)]
*  Do you hear folks talk about it? Oh, yeah. This is one of the top issues I hear about, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=292.08s)]
*  especially when I go out and knock doors. And I actually just had a roundtable with folks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=295.44s)]
*  And a lot of people have kind of a caricature of who this impacts, but it impacts everybody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=299.2s)]
*  under the sun. I had senior citizens on a fixed income saying, I think I'm going to have to move [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=304.24s)]
*  out of my house. I've been in for 50 years. Because the premiums get jacked. Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=309.12s)]
*  Right. Because they've already, they've paid off their mortgage, right? So they don't have variable [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=312.8s)]
*  costs anymore. Exactly. They've got property taxes and then they've got the insurance. So [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=316.24s)]
*  if that keeps going up. Yeah, it's pricing people out. It's also working families and also young [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=320.72s)]
*  people who are trying to build wealth and buy. They can't even do it right now in the state of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=326.32s)]
*  Florida. And the governor isn't doing anything about it. In fact, he had a special session. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=329.68s)]
*  And many people, including myself, believe that the bill they passed actually made it worse, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=335.04s)]
*  because for him, it's not about corporate greed or we shouldn't be regulating the reinsurance [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=338.88s)]
*  market. For him, he says that we're in this problem because of people who abused the system. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=343.6s)]
*  Yes. Less than 1% of people. Well, it's very interesting because basically the insurance [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  industry down there says, no, it's not really climate and it's not storms. It's fraudsters who [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=352.24s)]
*  are abusing us. And they call that special session. I've seen other experts who say that's not going [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  to get it done. It's not going to get it done. We need regulation. We need to look at the actual [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=362.8s)]
*  problem. But here's the thing. When you elect someone like Ron DeSantis, who does the biddings [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  of corporations and billionaires, of course he's not going to pass anything to regulate it and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=370.16s)]
*  actually help working families. And so this is a huge failure of Republican leadership in the state [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  of Florida. And that's what happens when you elect someone like Ron DeSantis. You represent [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=380.16s)]
*  a district in a state that is very exposed to climate risk. Obviously, the National Weather [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=385.44000000000005s)]
*  Service has put out this warning basically saying, look, the Atlantic's the hottest it's ever been. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  We're looking at possibly projecting a record number of named storms coming over the summer [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=396.88s)]
*  and into the fall and hurricane season. I'm curious how much that news, I know I follow [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=403.36s)]
*  this stuff, in a place like Florida, in your district, is that setting into people? Are they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=410.16s)]
*  looking towards this summer knowing that? It is setting into people. You know what's interesting? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=414.16s)]
*  I've had folks who are conservatives reach out to me and said, you know what, before a few years ago, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=417.28s)]
*  I didn't really care much about the climate change issue, but now it's impacting my day to day or [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=422.56s)]
*  it's impacting my business. The water surrounding Florida is the temperature of a hot tub. Hot water [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=426.96s)]
*  fuels these hurricanes. It's like 84 off Miami. Yeah, it's wild. Right. It fuels these storms. It makes them last [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=433.52s)]
*  longer and create more destruction. And in fact, two years ago, we had Hurricane Irma. I was out knocking [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=439.12s)]
*  doors a few months ago in a community called Orla Vista, which is in central Florida. A lot of these [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=443.68s)]
*  folks are still living in sheds behind their house because the flooding was so much that it completely [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=448.0s)]
*  ruined their house. Still. Still. And the insurance companies are denying a lot of their claims. They're [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=453.52s)]
*  playing this game where they're saying, what wasn't the flooding? It was the wind. Or no, it wasn't the wind. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=458.24s)]
*  It was the flooding. And this is the issue we have in the state of Florida. So we need real leadership [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=461.76s)]
*  from our state government because this hurricane season, and hopefully everybody's wrong, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=466.48s)]
*  but they're saying it's going to be one of the worst that we've had. All right, Congressman, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=471.12s)]
*  Maxwell Alejandro Frost. Thank you very much. Of course. Thank you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72p944tLQSk&t=474.0s)]
