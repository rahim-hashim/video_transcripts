# ‘Madness’: Democrats still aren’t taking the age issue seriously, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE)
*  The caucus and the party made its decision. They made it their choice and I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=0.0s)]
*  respect the outcome of the results and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=6.08s)]
*  We're moving forward [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=9.92s)]
*  Today Democratic congressman Jerry Connolly of Virginia was elected by his caucus to be the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=12.6s)]
*  That's the highest ranking member of the minority party the Democrats [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=19.56s)]
*  Connolly who is 74 and was just diagnosed with esophageal cancer [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Beat back a challenge from 35 year old progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=28.4s)]
*  amid calls for a new generation of leadership in the Democratic Party as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=33.2s)]
*  Democrat Don Bayer of Virginia a Connolly ally put it quote Jerry's a young 74 cancer notwithstanding [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=37.24s)]
*  Now to be clear, I'm sure Jerry Connolly will do a fine job as the ranking Democrat on oversight [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=45.04s)]
*  I understand his colleagues respect him. I understand the way seniority works in Congress, which has been there forever [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=50.0s)]
*  Often there's a reason for it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=55.04s)]
*  You learn a lot over the years [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=56.4s)]
*  But in light of everything that has happened over the past decade [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=58.4s)]
*  It does feel like Democrats still have not learned a pretty important lesson here [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=60.84s)]
*  Back in 2013 when some liberals called for the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=66.32s)]
*  Then President Barack Obama invited Ginsburg at the time an 80 year old cancer survivor to an out infamous lunch meeting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=71.64s)]
*  The president gently implied that it was time for her to pass the torch before the 2014 midterms [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  When Democrats were expected to lose the Senate making it impossible to replace her with another ideological liberal on the court [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  Ginsburg refused to step aside [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  You're 83 you're the oldest serving member on the Supreme Court [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=93.48s)]
*  How long do you think you can do this? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I'm okay this year [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  What will be next year? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm hopeful however, because my most senior colleague the one who most recently retired [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=111.6s)]
*  Justice John Paul Stevens stepped down at age 90. So I have a way to go [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=117.8s)]
*  Republicans retook the Senate in 2014 and they held it until [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=123.72s)]
*  2021 Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020 at the age of 87 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=126.8s)]
*  Three years after that interview and seven years after her meeting with Obama [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=131.76s)]
*  Donald Trump and the Republican Senate and just a few months before the election replaced her with conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett further cementing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  conservative control the court for generations to come and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=143.12s)]
*  facilitating the end of Roe v. Wade [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  You would think that would have been enough for Democrats to start taking the age issue seriously [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=149.08s)]
*  But it was not in April of last year President Joe Biden announced [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=154.8s)]
*  He was running for reelection [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  Even though he was the oldest man to ever serve as president and was also clearly having a hard time [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Communicating at the level necessary to occupy the bully pulpit [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't until over a year later when Biden gave a cataclysmic performance in his first debate with Donald Trump that the Democrats changed course [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=170.04s)]
*  after a wrenching excruciating process just months out from the election [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=178.0s)]
*  Biden again to his credit finally stepped aside under enormous pressure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  But he clearly didn't do so under the conditions we can say in retrospect that would have been best for Democrats to want run a winning campaign [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  You would think that would have been enough for Democrats to start taking the age issue seriously [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=195.28s)]
*  But it was not [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=201.52s)]
*  Jerry Connolly won that vote today [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=203.08s)]
*  And he did so thanks in part to former speaker Nancy Pelosi whipping votes for him now again to her credit enormous credit [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=205.36s)]
*  Pelosi did choose to step aside and relinquish her job as House Minority Leader [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=213.52s)]
*  To a new generation of leadership [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=217.84s)]
*  She also played an enormous role in the successful effort to push Joe Biden to step aside this summer [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=219.76s)]
*  Which was very hard to do and I think the right thing to do [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=224.12s)]
*  But now Pelosi whipped votes to make sure that Connolly got the oversight job [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=226.74s)]
*  Over the young star in the party even as the 84 year old Pelosi is recovering from hip surgery after suffering a fall [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=230.96s)]
*  It feels like a moment of genuine madness [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  And look [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  No one wants to think about their own mortality. I sure as heck don't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=245.04s)]
*  There are lots of people who live very long active lives [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=249.16s)]
*  Well into their 80s 90s even John Paul Stevens lived years after he retired from the court tonight at the age of 90 [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=251.92s)]
*  but as a general matter [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=257.64s)]
*  this is a very risky undertaking for everyone and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=260.32s)]
*  Democrats are not taking this issue seriously [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=264.0s)]
*  despite [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=267.2s)]
*  Everything that's happened, but they need to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=268.56s)]
*  Democratic senator Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire just said she's undecided if she will run for another six year term in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=271.56s)]
*  2026 when she will be 79 years old and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=278.8s)]
*  Again, this is nothing against Senator Shaheen personally [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=282.6s)]
*  But according to Pew polling from just last year 79 percent of Americans support age limits for politicians in Washington [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=285.0s)]
*  That is a striking overwhelming number in today's polarized environment [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=291.88s)]
*  79% of Americans don't agree on anything, but they agree on this and Democrats should listen [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN49xIL0IzE&t=295.76s)]
