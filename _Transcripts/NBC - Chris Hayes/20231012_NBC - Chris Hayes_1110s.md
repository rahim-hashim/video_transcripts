# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 11
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs)
*  The House of Representatives briefly gaveled into session today, but is still unable to take any meaningful action on the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=0.0s)]
*  And that's because House Republicans still have not chosen a new Speaker of the House more than a week after they fired the last guy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=7.5s)]
*  Honestly, they're not any closer a resolution than they were a week ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=15.5s)]
*  Today, in a closed-door secret ballot vote, the House Republican Conference chose Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise as their next boss. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=18.5s)]
*  Scalise beat Donald Trump's hand-picked choice, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, 113 to 99. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=26.5s)]
*  But if you thought that was the end of the protracted fight for the Speaker's gavel, you have not met the current House Republican majority. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=32.0s)]
*  You see, there was supposed to be a formal vote to elevate Scalise to the Speakership about six hours ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=38.0s)]
*  That didn't happen because it turns out he still doesn't have the votes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=43.0s)]
*  Even though Jim Jordan, the guy who's running against, and Matt Gaetz, the guy who led the drive to fire McCarthy in the first place, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=47.0s)]
*  both back him in a perfect encapsulation of Republican dysfunction. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=53.0s)]
*  We heard from two different House members who refused to vote for him today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=57.0s)]
*  Chip Roy of Texas, who thinks Scalise is too close to the establishment, and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=61.0s)]
*  who once proudly touted Scalise's endorsement just a couple of years ago and now claims he's too extreme. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=67.0s)]
*  Are you worried about Scalise having been McCarthy's number two? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=77.0s)]
*  I don't kind of view it through those lens. I will say that going down the road to the status quo is not my preferred option. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=80.0s)]
*  I personally cannot in good conscience vote for someone who attended a white supremacist conference and compared himself to David Duke. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=87.0s)]
*  Michael Steele is a former chairman of the RNC, Sahil Kapoor is national political reporter for NBC News. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=97.0s)]
*  His latest piece is titled, Scalise Brings a Fresh Face but a Similar Policy Vision as McCarthy, Republicans say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=102.0s)]
*  And they join me now. Sahil, let's just talk about what went down today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=108.0s)]
*  You've got a vote behind closed doors. How does that vote work? I think it's a secret ballot vote, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=112.0s)]
*  That's right, Chris. It is a secret ballot vote. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=119.0s)]
*  And Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, the natural successor to Kevin McCarthy, beat out Jim Jordan, the right wing firebrand, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=122.0s)]
*  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who at least in public endorsements heading into this contest seemed to have an edge. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=129.0s)]
*  But Scalise, it turns out, had most of the silent members, the ones who don't go on TV as much, who aren't as popular on conservative media. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=136.0s)]
*  They preferred Scalise. Still, it was a narrow vote. And now Scalise has got to figure out how to get to 217 votes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=143.0s)]
*  He's got his own Rubik's Cube here. McCarthy had trouble corralling the majority of the Republican conference, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=149.0s)]
*  or rather almost every member, as he needed to do every day to keep the job. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=155.0s)]
*  Scalise has got a different and equally challenging equation on his hands right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, Michael, one thing that is notable to me, we had this happen with Liz Cheney. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=164.0s)]
*  Liz Cheney, there was a secret ballot to expel her from leadership. She won that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=169.0s)]
*  Then there was a recorded vote, and she lost that after Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=174.0s)]
*  And I just thought it was just, it's worth noting that Donald Trump threw his weight behind Jim Jordan and endorsed him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=178.0s)]
*  And in a secret ballot, they did not go with Donald Trump's suggestion, which I think is pretty interesting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=185.0s)]
*  Well, it just tells you how afraid they are of Donald Trump and, more importantly, his base, who obviously are not happy about this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=192.0s)]
*  Steve Scalise has more than a numbers problem, in my estimation. He still has a policy problem. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=201.0s)]
*  He has a, do I partner with Joe Biden to, you know, pay the nation's bills problem? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=209.0s)]
*  How do I help, you know, fight against Hamas and stand with Israel at the same time, try to ignore Ukraine problem? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=215.0s)]
*  So there are a lot of other aspects to this, to Sahil's great reporting over the last couple of weeks about how these narratives are starting to unfold. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=224.0s)]
*  The backstory drama, Chris, is not the who's the head in the horse race for the speaker. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=234.0s)]
*  The question I hear from a lot of Republicans, what the hell do we do once we get the job? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=241.0s)]
*  Once he gets it back, you put a new leader in, what do we do? Because the base has got them boxed in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, that gets to an important thing. One of the things in covering this story we've gone back and forth on is, is there an ask here? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=253.0s)]
*  Right? Is there a demonstrable ask? And there sort of was and wasn't a defund Jack Smith. Not going to happen, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=260.0s)]
*  One of them was we don't like these continuing resolutions that fund the government. We want to go through regular order appropriations process. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=265.0s)]
*  So that was a big one. To the extent there was like a principled one. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=272.0s)]
*  And we want these dramatic cuts that are below the level that were negotiated with Biden in the deal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=274.0s)]
*  Sahil, here's my question for you. My understanding is that Jordan and Scalise both came before the conference to be like, yeah, we're going to have to sign a CR. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=280.0s)]
*  We have to do a CR, continuing resolution. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=287.0s)]
*  So there's already this concession that the whole thing this was ostensibly about isn't happening. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Chris. It is a jumble. Now, 96% of the Republican conference, remember, supported Kevin McCarthy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=294.0s)]
*  Among that 96% was Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan. They both spoke out on the floor just a few feet away from where I'm standing right now, urging those eight rebels not to evict Kevin McCarthy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=301.0s)]
*  But they didn't listen. And now you've got a situation where Steve Scalise is, yes, he is, you know, winning over some of those rebels who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy, including Matt Gaetz, including Tim Burchett. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=312.0s)]
*  But he's got his own problems in other areas. There are some members, you know, who have flipped from a yes on McCarthy to a no on Scalise. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=324.0s)]
*  That includes Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boberg. They had made their peace with the McCarthy speakership. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=332.0s)]
*  They both said they're not ready to support Steve Scalise for speaker. And then you have Nancy Mace and Bob Good, who were a no on McCarthy and are still a no on Scalise. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=337.0s)]
*  There's no one consistent ask here. There's no one thing Scalise needs to do. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=346.0s)]
*  A lot of these members are beholden to a very conservative base that wants them to essentially do magic to make a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president accept very conservative bills that a narrow Republican House might pass, which Democrats are simply never going to. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=350.0s)]
*  So, you know, how Scalise resolves that? It's very unclear. Most of the Republicans I spoke to today say he shares a governing vision, you know, the same as McCarthy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=365.0s)]
*  They're not that different on policy. But the one area where he might have a leg up, Chris, is that he doesn't have the same personality clashes and feuds with people like Matt Gaetz that Kevin McCarthy does. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=374.0s)]
*  That is, if anything, his ace in the hole right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=384.0s)]
*  Well, but here's the thing. The other part of this, do you agree, there's no like actual consistent caucus here or even a governing project that unites everyone, which I think is actually the problem at the heart of this, Michael. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=387.0s)]
*  You know, the narrow majority means that it's been demonstrated you can extract some concessions or you can extract fundraising or you can extract TV hits or whatever it is at the margin. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=398.0s)]
*  Right. So when you got Chip Roy and you got Nancy Mace and Bob Good and who knows who else, you know, there's a few others today. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=407.0s)]
*  But I thought this was interesting from Ken Buck, who's emerged as a very interesting figure in this caucus. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=414.0s)]
*  He said he asked Jordan and Scalise yesterday the flat out question, basically who won the 2020 election. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=420.0s)]
*  And I want to play you what he had to say. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=427.0s)]
*  I asked last night, will you unequivocally and publicly state that the election, the 2020 presidential election was not stolen? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=429.0s)]
*  He didn't answer that question very clearly. And Jim Jordan didn't answer that question very clearly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=439.0s)]
*  I thought it was pretty interesting. That's an interview with my colleague, Katie Tur. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=445.0s)]
*  And I also think it's like a worthwhile exercise to do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=447.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're, you know, people are holding out for for the votes like good on you, Ken Buck, if that's what you can extract. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=450.0s)]
*  Well, it's not a question so much of extracting. It's just it's a question of kind of put in front of the body. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=458.0s)]
*  Look at what we're going to go out to the public with. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=465.0s)]
*  I mean, I can't even inside the room get you to say, yeah, it was it was stolen or no, it wasn't stolen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=468.0s)]
*  Well, how what do you think the press is going to do when you get when you get out in public? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=476.0s)]
*  What does the public say? And that's the problem. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=480.0s)]
*  Put your finger on a very important strain here. It's governing the word governing is having not just having majority is having a majority that can govern. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=482.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you can be opposition all day long. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=491.0s)]
*  You can scream and shout at the rafters all day long. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=494.0s)]
*  But at some point, the nation's got to pay its bills. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=497.0s)]
*  At some point, the nation's going to need a budget to pay the bills for next year. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=500.0s)]
*  At some point, your allies are going to say, hey, can you help a brother or sister out? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=504.0s)]
*  Yes. You've got to be prepared to do that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=508.0s)]
*  Yes. And in fact, there's there's going to be a fairly pressing things moving on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=511.0s)]
*  I think probably most likely Israel and Ukraine, Sahil, which is going to ratchet up the pressure. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=517.0s)]
*  Michael Falls has been has been saying that as well. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=523.0s)]
*  What is the status now? Like we were going to have this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=527.0s)]
*  It was going to be they were going to take the conference vote. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=530.0s)]
*  Everyone's going to come together when elect a speaker today. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=533.0s)]
*  Now we're in recess. We still have Patrick McHenry as as the interim speaker or Speaker Pro Tem who has no actual constitutional authority other than occupying the chair while we wait for a speaker be elected. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=535.0s)]
*  So, Sahil, what happens now? We don't know yet, Chris. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=545.0s)]
*  There are no updates. The House is still frozen. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=549.0s)]
*  They adjourned for the day. They're back tomorrow at noon. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=551.0s)]
*  We don't even know if they're going to have a vote tomorrow. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=554.0s)]
*  They haven't scheduled it yet. It's very simple here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=556.0s)]
*  They're going to vote once Steve Scalise has at least 217 votes out of two hundred and twenty one. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=559.0s)]
*  We have no idea how long that's going to be. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=563.0s)]
*  There is a strong sentiment within the Republican conference, nearly unanimous, I would say, among the people I've talked to, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=565.0s)]
*  which is that they shouldn't go to the floor of the House until they have the votes for a speaker and put themselves and the country through that humiliation of 15 ballots doesn't really serve anyone. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=572.0s)]
*  But this this ultimately does come down to Steve Scalise. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=582.0s)]
*  It will come down to Steve Scalise, Republicans say, in terms of when to call that vote. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=586.0s)]
*  Only he can decide when the numbers are there and only he can tell them, OK, let's go to the floor. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=590.0s)]
*  I've got it. All right. Sahil Kapoor and Michael Steele. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=595.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=598.0s)]
*  So at first I'm hearing this gunfire from the fields, but then I hear it from the road and then I hear it from the neighborhood and then I hear it outside my window. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=601.0s)]
*  Then I hear shouting and I understand Arabic. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=611.0s)]
*  I understood exactly what was happening. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=614.0s)]
*  Basically, I understood that Hamas has infiltrated our kibbutz, that there are terrorists outside my window and I'm locked in my house and inside my safe room with two young girls. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=617.0s)]
*  And I don't know if anyone is going to come to save us. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=629.0s)]
*  One of the most gripping accounts about what happened in Israel over the weekend has just stuck with me. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=632.0s)]
*  I can't stop thinking about what's from a reporter for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=637.0s)]
*  His name is Amir T-Bone. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=641.0s)]
*  He lives with his family in the kibbutz near Gaza border, and he spoke to the Atlantic's Yair Rosenberg to tell him the story of how the attack unfolded and how they managed to improbably walk away with their lives. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=643.0s)]
*  And Yair Rosenberg, who conducted that interview, joins me now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=653.0s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=656.0s)]
*  It was just a grueling account. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=657.0s)]
*  Take me through what he told you about how this unfolded. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=660.0s)]
*  Yeah, so Amir lives, as you said, right near the Gaza border. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=664.0s)]
*  It's a few football fields, and they're so close to the Gaza border that they don't have iron dome because it will be useless. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=669.0s)]
*  And so instead, every home by law has a safe room, which is not what you think of as a fancy room. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=676.0s)]
*  It's just a reinforced concrete room that you put the kids into sleep. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=682.0s)]
*  And then if you hear rockets, as the parents, you run into that safe room. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=685.0s)]
*  And this is because the way that iron dome works, the sort of trajectory, it's too close to the border for it to work. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=689.0s)]
*  That's how close they are. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=695.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=696.0s)]
*  And so what actually saves their lives, ironically, is that they fire mortars at the village before they invade on foot. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=697.0s)]
*  And so they hear the sound of the mortar. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=705.0s)]
*  They think, OK, this is another rocket attack where the kids are sleeping in the safe room. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=707.0s)]
*  We'll run into the safe room and we'll wait it out like we usually do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=710.0s)]
*  And then maybe we'll as soon as there's a lull, we'll pick up and go. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=713.0s)]
*  And they're starting to pack in the safe room, getting ready to do that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=716.0s)]
*  And then, as you heard, Amir says, then he hears gunfire that they never hear. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=719.0s)]
*  Right. That shouldn't be there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=723.0s)]
*  And it gets closer and closer. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=725.0s)]
*  Amir, you need to understand, as a reporter, he speaks Arabic. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=726.0s)]
*  He wrote a biography of the Palestinian president. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=728.0s)]
*  And he knows once he hears them talking what is going on, which is that there are literally terrorists in his house. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=731.0s)]
*  They're on a group text with the other families in the kibbutz. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=736.0s)]
*  And everyone's like, there are terrorists inside my house. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=739.0s)]
*  And so then he texts his colleague who does the military affairs correspondent for our. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=742.0s)]
*  And he says, this is going on in my house. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=747.0s)]
*  And his colleague writes back and says, yes, Amir, I know they're in your house, but they're actually in not just everybody's houses. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=750.0s)]
*  They're in all of the border communities. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=755.0s)]
*  And that's when Amir got very, very frightened because then he realized, OK, it's one place the army could dispatch someone. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=758.0s)]
*  Maybe it's like one infiltration. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=764.0s)]
*  If it's an entire border, there's no way they can get to us. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=765.0s)]
*  This sort of palpable sense that comes through here, which is a shock of the scale of the infiltration and just also a sense that this sort of reliance or faith in the government that the army would be nearby and the realization that it is not that it is at the moment overwhelmed and not there. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=768.0s)]
*  Yes. And the psychology of calling his father who was retired. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=787.0s)]
*  And that's where he texts his colleague and then he texts his father and tells him what's going on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=791.0s)]
*  His parents say they're in Tel Aviv. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=795.0s)]
*  They're an hour and 20 minutes away by car. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=797.0s)]
*  They say we're coming. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=799.0s)]
*  They want to sit in their 60s and they just get on the road. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=800.0s)]
*  And his father's a retired general and he only has a pistol because he does not, in fact, hand out guns to just anybody, including retired service members. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=803.0s)]
*  And so he has a pistol and he starts and makes his way there. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=810.0s)]
*  And as the story goes, they keep encountering survivors, ambushes, all these things. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=813.0s)]
*  They go through the music festival. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=818.0s)]
*  They pick up people who are walking away from the music festival and they take them to safety. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=819.0s)]
*  So they don't just keep going straight. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=824.0s)]
*  What I find so remarkable, what I heard it is that if it was my kid, maybe I would just keep going straight. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=826.0s)]
*  Right. And like, you know, these people are alive. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=831.0s)]
*  They'll be OK or something like that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=833.0s)]
*  But every single person that they see, a wounded soldier, they see these refugees, these people have been injured at the music festival, but are still alive. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=834.0s)]
*  And they keep taking them to safety. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=840.0s)]
*  Eventually, they give away their car to take some people to the hospital. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=841.0s)]
*  So how does Amir's dad eventually get to Nakhav Oze, this place where his son is and his granddaughters are? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=844.0s)]
*  He finds he bumps into another retired Israeli general who also just showed up because nobody else was there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=850.0s)]
*  Right. And he had a civilian car. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=855.0s)]
*  It's not a jeep. It's not armored. There's nothing like that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=857.0s)]
*  It's just like a normal car you drive to work and they get on the road and they just drive together. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=859.0s)]
*  They meet up with some special forces who are preparing to go house to house, which is the most dangerous thing you can do in counterterrorism. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=864.0s)]
*  Try to get people out and they link up. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=869.0s)]
*  And as Amir tells it, right, they can tell that something's going on because now there's more gunfire. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=872.0s)]
*  But there are two kinds of guns. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=877.0s)]
*  And so they know there's a battle. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=879.0s)]
*  But you know what's going to happen if it's getting closer and closer and closer to them. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=880.0s)]
*  And then they hear his father's voice and his daughter says grandfather is here. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=883.0s)]
*  Right. And they know they're safe. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=888.0s)]
*  I want to read to you from the account we hear just hearing the gunfire getting closer and closer. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=889.0s)]
*  The girls have fallen asleep. Now they woke up. I think it's 2 p.m. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=892.0s)]
*  They haven't had anything to eat since last night. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=895.0s)]
*  There's no light. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=897.0s)]
*  We don't have cell phones anymore. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=898.0s)]
*  So we can't even show them our faces. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=899.0s)]
*  And there's one sentence that is keeping them from falling apart and starting to cry. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=901.0s)]
*  I'm telling them grandfather is coming. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=904.0s)]
*  I tell them if we stay quiet, your grandfather will come and get us out of here. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=906.0s)]
*  And at 4 p.m. after 10 hours like this, we hear a long bang on the window. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=910.0s)]
*  We hear the voice of my father, Ghalia, our oldest daughter says, Sabahigeya, grandfather is here. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=913.0s)]
*  And that's when we all just start crying. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=918.0s)]
*  And that's when we knew we were safe. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=920.0s)]
*  He has very strong thoughts about the security failure. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=923.0s)]
*  This is obviously someone who is a journalist. He's a learned man. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=928.0s)]
*  He he's a very critical Netanyahu government. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=931.0s)]
*  I think in the interview calls him the worst government Israel's ever had. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=934.0s)]
*  I think he uses that phrase. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=937.0s)]
*  But there is a sense of just that he said there was a social contract that we would live here and the government would protect us. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=939.0s)]
*  And they failed in that social contract. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=946.0s)]
*  Yes. So many countries, not just Israel, one of the ways you secure your borders is you put people on the borders because the idea is and this is actually this is something that my wife was a Tomlid professor point out is in the Tomlid. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=948.0s)]
*  They say that you don't destroy a village on the border, even if it's extremely sinful, because then the border itself will erode and you might get invaded. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=958.0s)]
*  But this was a no. This is a general strategic thing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=964.0s)]
*  So you put citizens on the border, but then you have to protect them, obviously, if they're there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=967.0s)]
*  Right. So no one's going to encroach on your land while people are there unless they want to attack. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=971.0s)]
*  And they expected right that the army would come and the army not only did it stop, it didn't stop you from getting in. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=975.0s)]
*  So one of the things he talks about in the piece is that there were there was there was a way that people were afraid that they would be attacked. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=981.0s)]
*  But it wasn't on the ground. It was underground. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=987.0s)]
*  In 2014, the last time Hamas and Israel fought on the ground in a ground invasion into Gaza, Israel discovered a ton of tunnels, the tunnels. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=989.0s)]
*  And this was talked about a lot by Israeli politicians and American politicians, the tunnels, the tunnels, the tunnels. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=997.0s)]
*  And the irony is they understood, but they didn't understand. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1002.0s)]
*  They understood that these were they got intelligence and they realized, oh, these tunnels are literally under communities like Amir's. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1004.0s)]
*  And the goal was to literally pop up all at once. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1010.0s)]
*  The intelligence was 200 people all at once and just kill mass killing civilians and maybe kidnap some people. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1012.0s)]
*  And in other words, exactly what we saw nine years later, basically. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1019.0s)]
*  But instead of going underground, they just came over the border. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1023.0s)]
*  So what happened? Israel spent a lot of money closing all those tunnels, building effectively an underground wall. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1026.0s)]
*  But they didn't actually secure above ground nearly as well as they thought. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1031.0s)]
*  Right. And that is why you end up with just a ground invasion right on land. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1034.0s)]
*  And so they understood the tunnels were a threat. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1038.0s)]
*  But I think this is something important to understand. Amir did not say this. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1041.0s)]
*  This is me talking to you as a reporter and analyst. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1044.0s)]
*  You have this intelligence in 2014 that they sort of uncovered by dumb luck because they go into this ground war with Hamas and they discovered the class was just about to execute this plan. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1046.0s)]
*  And they find these tunnels. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1054.0s)]
*  They want to mass kill civilians on the border. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1055.0s)]
*  And through dumb luck, another government escaped that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1057.0s)]
*  But they were almost sleepwalking into that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1060.0s)]
*  Right. At the time, I think a lot of reporters and analysts sort of dismissed it because they said, OK, they found this intelligence. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1062.0s)]
*  Maybe Hamas wasn't serious. Maybe it was just a plan or maybe it's the idea for the security services releasing something to scam monger. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1067.0s)]
*  But the security services do that right to, you know, reinforce the need for their existence. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1073.0s)]
*  But now we know that actually they just waited. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1077.0s)]
*  They just planned for another nine years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1079.0s)]
*  And then they did it a different way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1081.0s)]
*  Gary Rosenberg, who conducted that amazing interview in the Atlantic. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1083.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. Appreciate it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1086.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkI47r3Jvs&t=1087.0s)]
