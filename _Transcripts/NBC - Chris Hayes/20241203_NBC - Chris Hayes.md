# ‘Do you have a problem with drinking?’ Hegseth faces new 'jaw-dropping' allegations
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8)
*  Mr. Hagseth, how do you respond to the New Yorker article about you today? You misspent funds, mistreated women, were intoxicated on the job. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you have any comment about that reporting at all? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=6.76s)]
*  I have a bunch of guys, kids. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=8.76s)]
*  Any comment about that reporting? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=10.76s)]
*  I lied to say they were late teams. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=12.76s)]
*  I decided to meet with Coach. Appreciate the opportunity to talk to Senators today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=16.76s)]
*  It's a great process. I respect it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=20.76s)]
*  I'm glad you're firm, all of you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=22.76s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=24.76s)]
*  It's like a gaggle of a locker room. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=30.76s)]
*  So that article suggests you have an alcohol problem. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=34.76s)]
*  You have a problem with drinking or alcohol? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=38.76s)]
*  See you guys. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=40.76s)]
*  Today, former Fox and Friends weekend host, Pete Hagseth, seen there in the office of Tommy Terrell, was back at the Capitol for at least his third time in three weeks, meeting with Senators, trying to convince them that he is qualified to lead the Department of Defense, the largest agency in the U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=42.76s)]
*  government, the most powerful army in the world. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, this comes following a series of allegations concerning his drinking and mistreatment of women. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Three Republican sources now telling NBC News that as many as six Senate Republicans, perhaps more, are currently not comfortable supporting Hagseth's bid to lead the Pentagon. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=67.52s)]
*  Of course, with the Republican votes in the Senate, he could only afford to lose three votes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=79.52s)]
*  Jane Mayer is a chief Washington correspondent for New Yorker, who just wrote an incredible deep dive into Pete Hagseth and his pattern of alleged misconduct at the Veterans Organization that he was the head of. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=84.28s)]
*  Jeff Charlottes, an author and journalist who wrote about Hagseth's extremism for religion dispatches, and they both join me now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=94.28s)]
*  It's great to have you both on. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=100.28s)]
*  You've both been doing great reporting on this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=102.28s)]
*  Jane, let me just start with you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=104.28s)]
*  The earlier reporting from the Washington Post about an allegation of sexual assault by a woman that Hagseth paid and had signed an NDA, he says they had a consensual sexual encounter and denies sexual assault on his part. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=107.04s)]
*  And I think you could say, well, you know, we don't know the truth of that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=119.04s)]
*  That's obviously a very serious allegation, but it doesn't directly speak to what kind of same manager he would be or how he would do it running an organization. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=123.04s)]
*  In the case of the reporting you did, you basically show a lot of concerns from a bunch of people associated with the Veterans Organization he ran with his management, and particularly around women and alcohol. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  And the allegations just keep piling up, really. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that's probably why his nomination seems so tenuous at this point. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what I was reporting was that there was a whistleblower report that was written not just by one person, but by a group of people who worked for him in a group called Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=157.56s)]
*  And I've interviewed several of the authors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=171.56s)]
*  And it's an eight-page report. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=173.56s)]
*  It's really detailed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=177.56s)]
*  It has dates, places, times, lots and lots of names. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=179.56s)]
*  I think there are 26 people named in it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=181.56s)]
*  And it describes a picture that is of very frequent serious intoxication on the part of Hegseth and a lot of instances of sort of sexual impropriety, including a moment where his staff had to try to intervene to keep him from getting onto the stage at a strip club to which he brought top managers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=184.32s)]
*  Otherwise, he was going to be the top manager. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=204.32s)]
*  He was so drunk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And people just described him. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I've talked to now numerous people there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  They have described him as drinking himself into the point where he has to be carried off to his room by people, if he's on the road at a hotel room or whatever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  And these are in his official duties. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  He's carrying out the duties of the staff. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  And he's not going to be able to do that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, it was a very serious picture. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=229.84s)]
*  And it wasn't just one whistleblower report either. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=231.84s)]
*  There was a letter also from a former employee who described a situation where Pete Hegseth was closing down the bar at a particular hotel in 2015. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=233.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=243.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=247.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=249.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=251.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=253.84s)]
*  And he was carrying out the duties of the organization. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=255.84s)]
*  And he and somebody else were chanting, kill all Muslims, kill all Muslims, in a drunken and violent way that the person who worked for the organization described as despicable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  So, I mean, there are things like this and many, I mean, sort of jaw dropping allegations in this report. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  And then now, of course, there's a new report out from NBC tonight that suggests that 10 people at Fox have said that he has they've had concerns about the amount of drinking that he's done even as recently as I think just when he was right before he was nominated by Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=281.36s)]
*  All of which is pretty interesting when you think about it, because Trump actually is very anti-alcohol. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=299.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=304.36s)]
*  And you really have to wonder how much of this was known to the transition staff. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=307.12s)]
*  And of course, it's a huge concern to anybody who for this particular job running the Pentagon where you have to be on alert and available to deal with world crises 24 hours a day. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=313.12s)]
*  I want to read what Hegseth's lawyer sent when asked for comment that they were not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by Petty Angel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=327.88s)]
*  It's a scrunched former associate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=335.88s)]
*  And I want to read that NBC News reporting, which is that Pete Hegseth drank in ways concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current former Fox employees. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=337.88s)]
*  Two of these people said that more than a dozen occasions during his time as co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend, which I would know is a weekend morning show, I believe it starts at 6 a.m. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=347.88s)]
*  That they smelled alcohol on him before he went on air. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=357.64s)]
*  One of the sources said they smelled alcohol on him as recently as last month and heard him complain about being hung over this fall. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=359.64s)]
*  The Trump transition team spokesperson saying these are disgusting allegations, completely unfounded and false. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=365.64s)]
*  Anyone peddling these defamatory lies is sickening. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=371.64s)]
*  That is the sort of character management lane of critiques or concerns about Pete Hegseth. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=375.64s)]
*  Jeff, you've been doing a lot of reporting on the kind of what I would say were ideological concerns. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=384.4s)]
*  Basically, this is a person with a worldview that's kind of fundamentally at odds with liberal democratic norms and that that itself should be worrying as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=388.4s)]
*  He's absolutely opposed to it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=400.4s)]
*  What's interesting where this intersects with Jane's reporting is his books like American Crusade and which he calls Trump a crusader and Chief calls for a holy war, calls for arming yourself physically. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  That book, he has since said, wasn't conservative, theologically conservative enough. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  He says something happened around 2018 that made him realize he had to turn to an even more militant expression of Christianity, which brings us to his most recent book. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=420.92s)]
*  And which he says his earlier work talking about taking back education, shutting down government schools, training your children to do damage to the enemy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=432.92s)]
*  This is what education is about. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=442.92s)]
*  That that was all soft. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=444.92s)]
*  That was a political project. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=446.92s)]
*  And he begins the project now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=449.68s)]
*  He borrows from the Bible the story of Gideon. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=451.68s)]
*  And he says he'd always heard the story wrong. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=453.68s)]
*  He'd heard it as the wonderful story of Gideon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=455.68s)]
*  And instead, what he takes from it now is the need to purge internal enemies. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=457.68s)]
*  He says the fight begins with the struggle against domestic enemies. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=463.68s)]
*  And Gideon doesn't rest easy having defeated his enemies. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=467.68s)]
*  But and this is Hegseth's words, he eliminates them all. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=471.68s)]
*  Everyone must be killed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=474.68s)]
*  And he's not just saying, kill all Muslims, he is bringing his holy war home domestically. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=477.44s)]
*  I think both of these sort of strains of concerns are obviously extremely alarming to myself. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=483.44s)]
*  I think the former set of concerns, Jane, are the ones that are getting the attention I would imagine from Republican senators who in NBC News reporting are saying that they're not, that there are some real concerns. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=491.44s)]
*  On the most basic level you talked about, this is the head of the world's most powerful military. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=506.2s)]
*  Like you just couldn't have a person who is blacked out at 4 a.m. running the Department of Defense. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=512.2s)]
*  I mean, just realistically, if you had a world crisis. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=520.2s)]
*  I mean, I think that you're right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=524.96s)]
*  And I think also, of course, there's a history of the Senate rejecting blocking a nominee before for the Defense Department because of his drinking problem. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=527.96s)]
*  And that's John Tower in 1989. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=537.96s)]
*  And so I think there's it's not this is really not a partisan issue. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=539.96s)]
*  Even I think it's been a bipartisan concern in the past, as it was in 1989. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=545.96s)]
*  It's a competency issue and it's a national security issue. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=551.72s)]
*  And I think that's why even people on the Republican side of the ledger are very worried about this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=555.72s)]
*  Rightfully so. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=564.72s)]
*  We're going to stay on this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=565.72s)]
*  Jane Mayer and Jeff Charlotte, both of them doing great reporting that I recommend you check out. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=566.72s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=570.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6UsI633_F8&t=580.96s)]
