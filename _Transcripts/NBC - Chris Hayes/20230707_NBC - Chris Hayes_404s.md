# ‘Fundamental right’ Judges rule against health care bans for trans youth
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM)
*  On June 28th, a federal judge in Tennessee, who was appointed by Donald Trump, temporarily [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=0.0s)]
*  blocked portions of a state ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=5.44s)]
*  In the nearly 70-page opinion, the judge writes, quote, parents have a fundamental right to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  direct the medical care of their children, which naturally includes the right of parents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=15.5s)]
*  to request certain medical treatments on behalf of their children. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=19.36s)]
*  And when considering the irreparable harm that could come to trans youth were the law [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=23.3s)]
*  to go in effect, the judge writes, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=26.84s)]
*  So far, six different federal judges, including Trump-appointed judges in Indiana and Alabama, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=43.64s)]
*  have ruled against these bans, either in part or in total. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=49.84s)]
*  It's a really remarkable string of legal victories for trans rights against an increasingly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=53.52s)]
*  intense campaign of repression. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  Chase Strangio is the deputy director for the ACLU's Transgender Justice Division, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  First of all, just your reaction, Chase, to the opinion in Indiana, but there's been a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  series of them in different venues that sound remarkably similar. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  What's the argument that you're making to federal judges like this judge in Tennessee, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=77.48s)]
*  and what's the reception been like? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=81.76s)]
*  Yeah, so it has been a clear and unanimous rejection of these laws. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=83.76s)]
*  And when the evidence is tested, which is what we suspected, the judges recognize that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=89.64s)]
*  there really is no evidence supporting these categorical bans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=93.56s)]
*  They are based on ideology opposing trans people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=97.32s)]
*  They're based on misinformation, and they're based in politics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=101.12s)]
*  We know that this is escalating in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  And when we go to court and we argue that these laws violate the Equal Protection Clause [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=109.04s)]
*  and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and put forth medical evidence, including [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=112.92s)]
*  expert witness testimony, the judges are unanimous and clear that these laws just simply do not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=117.76s)]
*  hold up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=123.08s)]
*  There's something really striking about that I want to just stay on for a moment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=125.12s)]
*  You know, I was thinking there's something similar with what happened with the claims [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=127.72s)]
*  of voter fraud and voter regularities, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=133.26s)]
*  So you've got all these people saying, oh, they're stealing the votes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=135.76s)]
*  And then what happens is you go into court and you say the court asked for evidence. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  And after 2020, they went zero for 60, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  They went to a bunch of courts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=146.92s)]
*  They said, no, there's no evidence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=147.92s)]
*  It is pretty striking that in this area where there has been a lot of coverage and contestation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=148.92s)]
*  and people saying there's lots of problems with medical care for trans youth, that when [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  they're brought under the rules of evidence into federal courts across the ideological [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  spectrum and across geography, and it is litigated on the facts that every single judge basically [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=163.32s)]
*  has cited with plaintiffs like yourself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=169.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=171.04s)]
*  And when the other side, when the state's defending these laws, put forth their purported [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=172.04s)]
*  experts in every single case, the courts have found that these so-called experts are unreliable, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=177.2s)]
*  inconsistent and making claims that simply are illogical. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=184.28s)]
*  And so it is very similar to the voter fraud allegations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  It is very similar to the anti-abortion playbook in terms of the rhetoric in the way it's being covered in the media. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=191.28s)]
*  I will say that at the end of the day, having now been in court in four different jurisdictions, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  we receive a fairer play in front of these federal judges across the country than we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  do in the center-left media. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  The, you know, the New York Times, the pages of the New York Times don't look at the evidence [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=208.8s)]
*  in the ways that we had these federal judges look at the evidence. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  When they look at the medical evidence, there is simply nothing supporting these bans other [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  than sensationalized claims and misinformation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=221.0s)]
*  And that is really important to understand because at the core of this are thousands [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=224.44s)]
*  of young people across the country who are about to lose the medical care that they are [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=228.88s)]
*  relying on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=233.32s)]
*  And we are falling prey to this campaign of misinformation that is being escalated in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=234.32s)]
*  the lead up to the 2024 presidential election. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=239.64s)]
*  And on that point, I had you on a podcast that is happening a few months ago. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  We were talking about this, right, about this sort of just onslaught of these laws. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=247.16s)]
*  And one of the things that you and I were discussing when you talk about irreparable [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=250.72s)]
*  harm, which is the standard to sort of enjoin a law, you know, anyone who is on any kind [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  of medication that they have a prescription to, they need, particularly if you are on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=259.68s)]
*  SSRIs, which tens of millions of Americans are, including myself, you know, you can't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=263.48s)]
*  go three or four days and just get cut off from it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  The irreparable harm of a law that just tells people from one day to the next, like you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  are cut off from your medication that a doctor under doctor supervision has prescribed you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=276.36s)]
*  That's something else that is stuck out in these decisions of all these judges recognizing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  just how unjustifiable and unjustified that would be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=287.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=291.76s)]
*  Not just, I mean, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the young people, for their parents who [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=292.76s)]
*  would then have to watch them suffer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=297.92s)]
*  And the arguments that are put forth as justification for these bans are things like the medication [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  has side effects. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we can all understand that all medication has potential side effects, things like they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  are prescribed off label. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=310.6s)]
*  In pediatrics, sometimes as many as 80 percent of medications are prescribed off label. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  Every single justification for these laws is true of so much of medicine that if these [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  were to be credited, then every form of medication, anything could be under assault. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=324.28s)]
*  And every single judge has recognized that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=329.08s)]
*  Anyone who's a parent knows that when your child is suffering, you are doing whatever [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=331.44s)]
*  you can to alleviate that suffering. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  We have parents who are going into court and bearing their souls and the judges, thankfully, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  are hearing them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=343.0s)]
*  And what I want now is for the country to hear those parents and these young people [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=344.0s)]
*  who need their medication. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=347.28s)]
*  The judge, Eli Richardson in Tennessee, pointed this out, the sort of consensus that's emerged [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=350.28s)]
*  from these federal courts on these laws. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  I thought it was interesting. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=356.55999999999995s)]
*  Though the court would not hesitate to be an outlier if it found such an outcome to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=357.55999999999995s)]
*  be required, the court finds it noteworthy that its resolution of the present motion [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=361.32s)]
*  brings it into the ranks of courts that have unanimously come to the same conclusion when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=364.84s)]
*  considering very similar laws. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=370.28s)]
*  Chase Strangio, who has had quite a role in this outcome and the struggle, of course, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=372.28s)]
*  on this continues, but it's very heartening to see this from the federal courts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=377.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=381.68s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=382.68s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UTqF7uCRgM&t=383.68s)]
