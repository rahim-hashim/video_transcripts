# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 12  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello Iowa. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=4.04s)]
*  Three days until the first Republican votes of 2024 and the coldest forecast in caucus [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=5.28s)]
*  history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=10.84s)]
*  You all are here in the middle of a blizzard. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=12.88s)]
*  The elements are, I'll break whatever we need to. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=14.44s)]
*  I don't even know what negative 15 is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=16.76s)]
*  Tonight, the defendant in the overthrow the election trial takes a break from the courtroom [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=19.84s)]
*  to head to the Iowa caucuses. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=24.64s)]
*  Then. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=26.92s)]
*  Every day, Mike Johnson gets closer and closer to this deal, brings me closer and closer [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=28.92s)]
*  to vacating the chair. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  A brand new House speaker already on the out of the MAGA caucus as Democrats demand an [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=35.96s)]
*  accounting of the Trump presidency. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=40.72s)]
*  You don't care about the principle that our government leaders should not be on the take [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  from foreign governments. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=48.6s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=49.92s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin joins me tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=50.92s)]
*  Plus. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=53.52s)]
*  I was hoping that this film could spark conversation, be a part of a conversation that we should [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=55.12s)]
*  be having in this country this year, right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Director Ava DuVernay on her brand new film, Origin. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=65.2s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=71.6s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=72.6s)]
*  It is here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=73.6s)]
*  Well, almost here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=74.6s)]
*  On Monday, Republicans will cast their ballots in the Iowa caucuses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=75.6s)]
*  It will be the first time since the January 6th insurrection, the voters will see Donald [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=78.84s)]
*  Trump's name on the ballot. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=84.32s)]
*  And a whole lot of those voters are going to support him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  They're going to say, yeah, yep, we want the guy that tried to steal the last election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=88.6s)]
*  and is now facing years in prison for doing it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=93.32s)]
*  It's already been a very weird campaign for a lot of reasons. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=96.24s)]
*  I mean, we started with a huge field of candidates. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=102.52s)]
*  And most of them have either dropped out or just faded into the background before the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  votes are cast. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=106.61999999999999s)]
*  Like they got winnowed out fast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  And when they are cast in three days, voters will be breathing snow and subzero temperatures [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=109.74s)]
*  in what is expected to be the coldest caucuses ever, which is saying something because there's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  been a lot of cold caucuses. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  Despite the cold, leading challengers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are dutifully trudging [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  across the state trying to drum up support. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  They will most likely still lose if polling is any indication that we don't know. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=129.38s)]
*  They could lose by historic margin to a front runner who, let's be clear, has spent more [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=133.7s)]
*  time in court attending his civil fraud trial this week than he has in the state of Iowa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=138.78s)]
*  And even if now it feels inevitable that we would come to this, it was not inevitable. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=146.44s)]
*  It really wasn't. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=151.38s)]
*  There was a time in winter 2021, after January 6, when Donald Trump was being impeached for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=152.38s)]
*  inciting the Capitol insurrection, his approval rating hit an all time low. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  It looked like he could very well be sent into a sort of permanent political exile. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=163.14s)]
*  And then he sort of came back and then the 2022 midterms, the elections worked out poorly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=167.7s)]
*  for most Trump endorsed candidates. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=173.42s)]
*  He backed losers in a ton of winnable races and there seemed to be a dawning awareness [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  in the Republican party that he was politically toxic. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  And 2024 could be a wide open race for Republicans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=182.61999999999998s)]
*  All those folks got in because they thought he was beatable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  Not now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=187.78s)]
*  Now Trump is polling at 54%, more than 30 points ahead of Haley, his closest challenger. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=188.82s)]
*  It is not even close enough to say it's not even close. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  Of course the only poll that matters is the one on election day, as we like to say here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=197.05999999999997s)]
*  But there's already a lot of discussion about sort of how we got here, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  On the threshold of this moment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=204.77999999999997s)]
*  And there's a lot of factors that have brought us to this point in which Trump is leading [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=207.14s)]
*  by 30 or 40 points. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=210.5s)]
*  There is the terrible, I mean truly almost historically terrible campaign of Ron DeSantis, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=212.48s)]
*  who once looked like a formidable challenger. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=218.38s)]
*  There's the growing desire in the Republican electorate for authoritarian politics. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  And that's fueled by this ever sort of radicalizing conservative media industry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=226.22s)]
*  There is of course the complete personal cowardice of Republican leaders who could have voted [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=232.3s)]
*  to convict Trump during impeachment. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=236.42s)]
*  We wouldn't have this problem. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=238.1s)]
*  But who've also run interference for Trump all along. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=239.1s)]
*  So all of those factors are here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=241.38s)]
*  But there is one factor on the eve of this first contest. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=242.74s)]
*  There's one factor I think does not get enough play. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=248.1s)]
*  And that's the tools of mob menace. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=251.38s)]
*  The coercion, the threats of violence the Trump and MAGA movements employ that are constantly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=253.94s)]
*  shaping the space in which the race is itself contested. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=258.86s)]
*  I talked yesterday about this, about the bomb threat at the home of the judge in Trump's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=263.1s)]
*  civil trial and how it was not an isolated incident. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=268.14s)]
*  It wasn't just business as usual. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=271.22s)]
*  From the MAGA bomber to the Cincinnati FBI shooter, remember that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=273.78s)]
*  The guy that showed up at the FBI after the indictments. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=276.86s)]
*  The death threats, the fake emergency calls against investigators and prosecutors, just [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=279.46s)]
*  a few in the past week, judges, election officials. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=283.38s)]
*  There has just been a constant stream of threats of violence and actual attempts at violence [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=286.26s)]
*  against people that have tried to hold Donald Trump to account. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=290.61999999999995s)]
*  The intimidation hangs over all of his endeavors is a big part of his strength. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=294.61999999999995s)]
*  But the place where this kind of politics is the most effective, the most acutely present, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=300.9s)]
*  is within Republican Party circles. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=306.58s)]
*  Because for people who exist in that world, inside the Republican Party, inside professional [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=309.58s)]
*  conservative politics, the harassment and threat of violence is much, much more intimate. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=313.02s)]
*  There were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security, afraid, you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=318.34s)]
*  know, in some instances for their lives. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=322.38s)]
*  Colleagues who are now traveling with armed escorts out of the fear for their safety. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=323.9s)]
*  Many of us are altering our routines, working to get body armor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=329.14s)]
*  Our expectation is that someone may try to kill us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=334.06s)]
*  The threats are constant. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=336.26s)]
*  They've increased. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=338.14s)]
*  You know, I even heard a voicemail just this morning that we got last night threatening [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=340.02s)]
*  execution. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=343.74s)]
*  That's kind of seems to be the normal thing nowadays, was just threaten execution. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=344.74s)]
*  Again, that all happened not a long time ago. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=349.78s)]
*  It's regrettably easy to forget now that Republicans who voted to impeach or convict Trump were, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=354.58s)]
*  they thought at least, and I think credibly, kind of putting their lives at risk, at least [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=360.02s)]
*  their family safety in themselves. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=364.18s)]
*  Finally, their peace of mind was put at risk. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=366.82s)]
*  I mean, do you remember this? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=368.74s)]
*  We just learned this a few months ago. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=370.46s)]
*  Senator Mitt Romney revealed that he had to spend $5,000 a day on protective security [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=371.98s)]
*  after January 6th. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  In fact, as he later revealed to Atlantic reporter, McCabe Coppens, in a biography of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  Romney, a reckoning, one Republican congressman confided to Romney he wanted to vote for Trump's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=382.42s)]
*  second impeachment, but chose not to out of fear for his family's safety. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=387.5s)]
*  And when one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning towards voting to convict, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=392.14s)]
*  the others urged him to reconsider. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=395.78s)]
*  You can't do that, Romney recalled someone saying. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=397.7s)]
*  Think of your personal safety, said another. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  Think of your children. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  The senator eventually decided they were right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=403.34s)]
*  And this extends past people that are at the upper echelons of political power, past politicians [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=407.02s)]
*  or public officials, more than just they have been subjected to this mob intimidation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=412.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, election officials and even like writers, just people with opinions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  Senator, writer and Trump critic David French has recounted how they went after him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=422.06s)]
*  An individual calls and said, I'm sorry, but I've been asked by the Trump campaign to make [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=427.54s)]
*  sure that, you know, David knows that this will be really, really bad for him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=432.82s)]
*  The assaults on my family have been overwhelming just as a writer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=436.7s)]
*  I have a multiracial family, and so they have gone after my youngest daughter in the worst [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=440.74s)]
*  way imaginable. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=446.1s)]
*  That was back in 2016. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=447.66s)]
*  Today, French, who's still conservative, strongly staunchly conservative and also strongly [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=448.86s)]
*  staunchly anti Trump wrote in the New York Times that things are even worse. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=452.98s)]
*  Quote, eight years of bitter experience have taught us that supporting Trump degrades the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=456.66s)]
*  character of his core supporters. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=460.98s)]
*  Never before have I seen extremism penetrate a vast American community so deeply, so completely [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  and so comprehensively. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you, this is all stuff that's sort of on the record and documented. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  For every example of this, there is stuff not on the record that people discuss about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=474.1s)]
*  their security situation, which they can't talk about publicly for obvious reasons, that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=479.66s)]
*  any time they're in the crosshairs, they're dealing with a security issue, cautious of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=483.94s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=487.98s)]
*  And that's particularly true for people whose life is Republican Party politics, whose constituents [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=489.94s)]
*  are conservatives and neighbors, who are Trump devotees. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=493.82000000000005s)]
*  This extremism, this acceptance of coercion, of political violence or the threat thereof, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=497.02000000000004s)]
*  of terror, of just insane harassment as a tactic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=503.7s)]
*  It's really powerful. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=509.02s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, I really believe this, that it has completely subverted the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=511.82s)]
*  ability of the Republican Party themselves to genuinely run a free and fair election [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=517.38s)]
*  within their own party to choose their own nominee. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=522.54s)]
*  Because not only is there this ever present threat, you know, everyone in the upper echelons [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=525.64s)]
*  of the party also understands that Donald Trump will never accept defeat. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=530.3s)]
*  I mean, you're having a contest with a guy who, is he going to accept defeat? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=534.62s)]
*  They understand it because of January 6th, but they understand it before that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=539.62s)]
*  They understand it because of 2016, when Trump lost the Iowa caucuses and he reportedly pressured [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=542.62s)]
*  state Republicans to invalidate the results. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=548.2199999999999s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=550.9s)]
*  He ran around afterwards saying it was rigged. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  So just take a second to imagine what it would look like if Nikki Haley or someone [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=556.38s)]
*  else actually were to start beating Donald Trump for the nomination this year. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=560.62s)]
*  If we started seeing some surprises, right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=563.78s)]
*  And that has happened before in American politics. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  It's just almost impossible not to imagine a situation in which you end up with a scene [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  that looks like January 6th outside the Republican National Convention. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=577.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=582.58s)]
*  If Trump starts losing, what's going to happen? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=585.26s)]
*  Play that out. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  They all have. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=588.5799999999999s)]
*  They all understand what they're dealing with. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  It is under those conditions. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=590.74s)]
*  Those are the conditions under which we are having this contest, this election for the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=593.5s)]
*  Republican nominee. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=596.9s)]
*  Whatever happens on Monday in Iowa and later in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=599.26s)]
*  Super Tuesday, you just cannot separate Trump's performance from these ever present, deeply [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=602.3399999999999s)]
*  ominous, anti-democratic threats of harassment and violence. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=607.74s)]
*  It's just a central part of what Donald Trump stands for, how he and his movement pursue [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=611.58s)]
*  political power. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=617.1s)]
*  Miles Taylor served in the Trump administration as a national security official. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=619.34s)]
*  He resigned in June of 2019. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=622.22s)]
*  He's since left the Republican Party. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=623.82s)]
*  He's author of Blowback, a warning to save democracy from the next Trump. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=625.5400000000001s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=628.94s)]
*  You know, Miles, I wanted to talk to someone who is from the world of conservative and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=629.94s)]
*  Republican politics, because every time that I've talked to folks in that world who themselves [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=633.38s)]
*  have come out against Trump or oppose Trump, the stories they tell me about the proximity [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=638.86s)]
*  of this kind of, you know, it's one thing if people are mean to you or say nasty things [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=643.82s)]
*  to you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=648.7s)]
*  That's just life. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=649.7s)]
*  But something more than that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=650.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, the stories I've heard are pretty chilling. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=652.5s)]
*  And I wonder what you think of the general thesis, that this kind of a little bit sort [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=654.9000000000001s)]
*  of invisible force really does exert some real pressure on the sort of basic shape of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=658.82s)]
*  this contest. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=665.34s)]
*  Oh, of course it does. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=667.26s)]
*  I mean, I remember something Alex Vindman once told me after his testimony when we were [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=668.74s)]
*  comparing notes about how we wish more people had testified in Trump's impeachment. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=673.5s)]
*  And he said, Miles, intimidation works. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=677.46s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=680.58s)]
*  It works. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=681.58s)]
*  They know it works. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=682.58s)]
*  Trump knows it works. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=683.58s)]
*  And I was really struck by something, Chris, in your opening remarks tonight about how [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=684.58s)]
*  a lot of these folks are facing threats and they don't talk about it on the record. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  Who and I both talked to a lot of people who've been in these circumstances and they don't [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=694.82s)]
*  even go into the detail of how serious it is. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=699.5s)]
*  And I think it's important, though, when people are willing to share those things. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=701.86s)]
*  I mean, I'll give you an example, Chris. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=704.94s)]
*  Just last weekend, I had to buy another gun because we're worried about threats from MAGA [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=706.86s)]
*  stalkers and concerned we have not armed ourselves sufficiently in every circumstance we might [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=712.94s)]
*  be in. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=719.82s)]
*  That's years after I came forward against Donald Trump. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's still happening. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=725.3000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=726.4200000000001s)]
*  Because they're so fearful of this messaging from conservatives against him. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=727.4200000000001s)]
*  They're worried it will deny him victory. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  But more so than that, Chris, we've seen Trump repost videos, these messianic videos, where [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=734.94s)]
*  in the videos people claim he's our savior. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=741.5400000000001s)]
*  And that's how he's radicalized supporters to think they're defending some kind of messiah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=745.5s)]
*  That's beyond what people do when it comes to backing their political candidates. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=751.66s)]
*  And it explains this, again, messianic level of violence that people are worried about. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=756.06s)]
*  And certainly people within the party who've opposed Trump feel bubbling just under the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=761.78s)]
*  surface. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=767.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=768.26s)]
*  And that point about, I mean, your personal experience was just striking and sounds awful. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=769.26s)]
*  And that sort of intimidation works. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=773.94s)]
*  I do think it's the most effective in this sort of internal discipline function. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  So if you look at Judge Chutkin or Jack Smith or Judge Ingorin or all these people, I don't [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  think they're going to be intimidated. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=785.06s)]
*  What it is, is it's hassle for them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=786.4599999999999s)]
*  It's disruptive. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=788.5799999999999s)]
*  It's bad for their families. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  But it's not going to stop them from doing what they're doing. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=790.5799999999999s)]
*  But I think there are people in Republican politics where it will. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=792.74s)]
*  Like I think the Romney point about it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=795.38s)]
*  And I think that, again, I don't want to take away from the fact that Trump genuinely has [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=797.78s)]
*  this organic, this real appeal. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=802.7s)]
*  And I think he would be probably winning even without this aspect of his politics. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=804.58s)]
*  But again, this aspect of the politics colors enough that, like, I just think it's difficult [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  to disentangle his ability to sort of reclaim his position as front runner from that force [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=815.1s)]
*  that's sort of just off stage. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, Chris, it does stop people from coming forward. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=823.5s)]
*  I mean, I agree with your point that folks who've already come out there, they're out [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=832.82s)]
*  But I've had folks in the backyard sitting around the bonfire that were senior Trump [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=833.82s)]
*  officials who've not come forward, who've said, I just don't know if I want to go through [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=838.94s)]
*  what you guys have gone through. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  It works. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=847.02s)]
*  The intimidation works. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=848.02s)]
*  And unfortunately, because of Donald Trump, this is going to be a historic election, Chris, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=849.02s)]
*  for all the wrong reasons, historic because the political polarization is at historic [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=856.2199999999999s)]
*  levels, the disinformation is at historic levels, the attitudes towards political violence, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=861.18s)]
*  as you pointed out, are at historic levels. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=867.06s)]
*  The volume of threats from extremist groups around the country are at historic levels. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=869.5799999999999s)]
*  And we're also seeing direct threats to public officials at absolutely historic levels. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=874.4599999999999s)]
*  I can back up every single one of those things with statistics. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=880.0999999999999s)]
*  This is an unprecedented election in terms of the fear and division and violence. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=883.84s)]
*  And I would agree with you. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=889.08s)]
*  I worry that it could boil over should Donald Trump not get what he wants. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=890.08s)]
*  We already have precedent for that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=895.08s)]
*  And we are seeing that intimidation bubble up within the Republican Party. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=897.0s)]
*  Just today, I saw videos of Ron DeSantis being mercilessly mocked and stalked all the way [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=900.44s)]
*  up almost to his hotel room in Iowa. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=905.84s)]
*  And it wasn't by Democratic operatives. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=909.12s)]
*  It was by Trump operatives and pro-Trump operatives who seemed to almost want to walk [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=911.72s)]
*  into his hotel room with him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=916.24s)]
*  That's pretty menacing behavior. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=918.1600000000001s)]
*  We haven't seen things like that in American elections before. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=920.28s)]
*  We're going to see what the voters say about it, at least the voters, the small percentage [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=923.2s)]
*  of Iowans that participate in the Republican caucus, which is a very, very small number [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  of people in the absolute terms, but we'll see what they have to say. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=932.0400000000001s)]
*  Miles Taylor, thank you for making time tonight. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=934.64s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  As the threat of Trump-inspired violence looms over the election, we're waiting to learn [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=939.48s)]
*  if the quadruply indicted ex-president will face accountability for what he did the last [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=943.36s)]
*  time he was in office. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  Andrew Weissman is here with the latest on that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=949.36s)]
*  Next. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  I think there's a larger issue Republicans have got to think of. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to lose that appeal. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=956.9200000000001s)]
*  He's going to end up going to trial in front of a stacked left-wing DC jury of all Democrats. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  What are the odds that he's going to get through that? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=965.52s)]
*  And that's even talking about the validity of the charges. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=967.32s)]
*  I don't think he gets through that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=970.88s)]
*  And so what are we going to do as Republicans in terms of who we nominate for president? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=972.48s)]
*  If Trump is the nominee, it's going to be about January 6, legal issues, criminal trials. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats in the media would love to run with that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=982.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=985.24s)]
*  Put aside the sort of gross and racist, frankly, aspersions cast on the jury pool of the Washington [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=986.24s)]
*  DC. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=992.4000000000001s)]
*  That was the first time that I've seen one of Donald Trump's competitors for Republican [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=994.04s)]
*  nomination, who's not in this sort of explicitly anti-Trump camp of Chris Christie or Asa [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  Hutchison, just raise the obviously clear possibility that Trump is going to face criminal [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1002.4s)]
*  trial and likely a convection in an election year, which could hurt him politically. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1008.1999999999999s)]
*  Of course, the ex-president is doing everything he can to make sure a trial doesn't happen, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1013.56s)]
*  or at least not before the election. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  And his most important case right now is his argument that he cannot be prosecuted for [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  trying to steal the 2020 election because he has complete presidential immunity. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1022.6s)]
*  His lawyers asserting in a DC court hearing that this immunity extends to the president, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1027.84s)]
*  hypothetically, ordering the assassination of political rivals by US armed forces and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1031.88s)]
*  a whole bunch of other things that you could brainstorm that he could do with no criminal [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1036.48s)]
*  sanction. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1039.92s)]
*  And we are now awaiting a decision from the DC court of appeals on that claim. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1040.92s)]
*  Andrew Weisman served in the Department of Justice for years, most recently as lead prosecutor [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1044.4s)]
*  for special counsel Mueller's team. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1048.16s)]
*  He is now co-host of the podcast, Prosecuting Donald Trump, and he joins me now. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1049.76s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1053.72s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1054.72s)]
*  First of all, let's talk about timing. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1055.72s)]
*  Arguments were Monday, I think, or Tuesday, right? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1057.36s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1059.52s)]
*  When do you expect that we'll get something? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1060.52s)]
*  Good chance it'll be this upcoming week. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1063.6s)]
*  Maybe another week, but it's going to be fast. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1066.8s)]
*  And the reason for that is they expedited this appeal. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1068.72s)]
*  This was really, really, really fast for the DC circuit. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1072.28s)]
*  So I think they're not going to sit on it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1076.16s)]
*  So the big question is, and I think that we all, everyone is expecting him to lose. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1078.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1082.74s)]
*  Maybe 3-0, at least 2-1, but there's three judges on the panel. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1083.74s)]
*  The big question, of course, and there's a Washington Post sort of TikTok on this, is [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1088.1399999999999s)]
*  timing, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1091.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1092.82s)]
*  And what do they do on timing? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1093.82s)]
*  What is your anticipation of what they will do, or what do you think they should do timing-wise? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1094.82s)]
*  So I think this is all about timing. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1099.9599999999998s)]
*  I think, you know, everyone discusses the merits of this. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1102.06s)]
*  There are no merits to this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1105.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it is a preposterous notion. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1106.5s)]
*  I've never been as convinced that the Supreme Court may take a pass on this as when I heard [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1110.02s)]
*  the oral argument, because it was so frivolous that as much as you think the Supreme Court [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1116.42s)]
*  might want to weigh in on this to make it absolutely clear, if you listen to the argument, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1121.3400000000001s)]
*  it's like, I mean, it was childish. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1126.9s)]
*  So everything, though, for Donald Trump is he could be like, yeah, you know what, I'm [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1129.42s)]
*  losing the battle and winning the war. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1134.26s)]
*  Because the normal time period for an appeal is he gets to ask the full D.C. Circuit. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1136.3s)]
*  Within 45 days, he can ask them to rehear the case. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1143.5s)]
*  Then he can also try and seek cert that is going to the Supreme Court. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1147.22s)]
*  That's another 90 days. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1150.66s)]
*  The D.C. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1152.74s)]
*  Circuit has the power to shorten that up by basically saying, you know what, we're going [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1153.74s)]
*  to give you five days, and then we're sending it back to Judge Chutkin. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1157.98s)]
*  If you do not get a stay from the Supreme Court, she goes forward. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1161.34s)]
*  So they can really bypass the I know this is like we're in the procedural weeds, but [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1165.2s)]
*  I got to ask, can they bypass his en banc? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1168.4s)]
*  They essentially de facto can. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1173.0s)]
*  I mean, the three judges can't just say there's no en banc. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1175.64s)]
*  They don't have that power. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1178.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1179.92s)]
*  But they can say you have five days. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1180.92s)]
*  In five days, we ruled as the panel that this goes back to Judge Chutkin. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1182.72s)]
*  At that point, there has to be some sort of stay. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1187.92s)]
*  So Donald Trump can try and get it from the en banc. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1191.32s)]
*  He can try and get it from the Supreme Court. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1195.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  But he has to go somewhere because now the default position is in five days, she goes [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  forward. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1203.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1204.44s)]
*  So there's a timer and it's ticking down and you got to do something. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1205.44s)]
*  And presumably they'll do I mean, again, the Colorado State Supreme Court, you know, put [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1207.8s)]
*  a time limit in right. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1211.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1213.44s)]
*  And in this 14th Amendment case, the Supreme Court took, they've expedited it again for [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1214.44s)]
*  them quite fast, right? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1218.84s)]
*  Really fast. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1220.24s)]
*  Phil, your arguments on February 8th, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1221.24s)]
*  So that would then push him to then go back to the court, probably the Supreme Court. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he might try and go to the panel and say, you know what, I want to hear it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1229.84s)]
*  The whole circuit hear it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1236.6399999999999s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1238.04s)]
*  There's no way the whole circuit is going to weigh in on this. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1239.04s)]
*  And the big open thing is going to be, I mean, why would the whole circuit do this? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1241.36s)]
*  I mean, this was a frivolous argument. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1244.9199999999998s)]
*  So the issue really will be whether the Supreme Court wants to weigh in or not. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1246.8s)]
*  If they do, they will stay it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1251.24s)]
*  I mean, it seems unlikely that they would say, yes, we're going to hear it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1254.2s)]
*  But Judge Chuckin, of course, they're going to stay it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1258.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1261.16s)]
*  So and then it would be on them. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1262.16s)]
*  Then the time frame goes on them. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1263.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1264.76s)]
*  Now, now they could do this sort of a month long process the way they did the Colorado [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1265.76s)]
*  case. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  But just remember, Judge Chuckin has still kept the March 4th trial date. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1271.16s)]
*  If the Supreme Court takes it, that trial date is off. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1277.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1280.4s)]
*  And the Manhattan District Attorney's Office is going to go forward at the end of March, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1281.4s)]
*  because that's the date that they have. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1284.48s)]
*  So there's no reason for them to delay it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1286.64s)]
*  They will be free to go forward. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1288.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1290.04s)]
*  If the Supreme Court doesn't take it, then there's a really good chance that what is [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1291.04s)]
*  going to happen is maybe not March 4th. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1295.56s)]
*  But around that. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1298.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1299.44s)]
*  Maybe a couple more weeks. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1300.44s)]
*  And you think the arguments were so, I mean, again, I'm a lay person here. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1301.44s)]
*  I found the impeachment thing so, like, they just seem so trapped in that argument. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1304.32s)]
*  It seems so manifestly preposterous. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1307.6799999999998s)]
*  And none of it, it just doesn't work with anything. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1309.9599999999998s)]
*  There's no reason for the Ford pardon of Nixon. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1312.12s)]
*  There are people who haven't been impeached who are federal officers who have then subsequently [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1314.52s)]
*  been convicted. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, like, none of this works with any of the history, any of the text of the Constitution. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  It's ludicrous. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1324.04s)]
*  You think it's frivolous enough that you can imagine a world in which SCOTUS just says, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1325.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1329.04s)]
*  So here's one of the things that I found fascinating. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1330.04s)]
*  Did you know how much questioning there was by the three judges on the impeachment first [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1332.8s)]
*  theory? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1337.52s)]
*  That's the argument that you have to be impeached and convicted first. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1338.52s)]
*  Zero. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1341.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the actual discussion of, like, let's just go through your reading of that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  There was no questioning on that because it was all about, like, if you were to lose on [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1347.04s)]
*  that, the case is over, right? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1352.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1354.28s)]
*  That's true. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1355.28s)]
*  Like, walk me through this argument, which, by the way, I wasn't even barely in the brief. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1356.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1360.68s)]
*  By the way, Judge Pan's, I mean, was fantastic. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1361.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1364.04s)]
*  But her best way of attacking this was really to force Donald Trump's lawyer to actually [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1365.04s)]
*  say his argument. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1370.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1371.92s)]
*  To bite the bullet on it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1372.92s)]
*  That was the moment, Andrew Weissman. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1373.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1374.92s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1375.92s)]
*  Still ahead, Donald Trump admits to collecting foreign money while he was president. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1376.92s)]
*  People were staying in these massive hotels, these beautiful hotels, because I have the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1382.0s)]
*  best hotels. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1385.92s)]
*  I have the best clubs. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1386.92s)]
*  I have the best clubs. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1388.3200000000002s)]
*  I have great stuff. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1389.76s)]
*  And they stay there and they pay. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1391.1599999999999s)]
*  They pay. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1393.7199999999998s)]
*  And now Congressman Jamie Raskin is demanding Trump pay it back. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1394.7199999999998s)]
*  That's next. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  If you have documented receipts of foreign governments writing checks or giving credit [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1404.76s)]
*  card payments to Joe Biden, show it to us. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1410.1599999999999s)]
*  We've been at this for a year now. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1413.52s)]
*  We haven't seen anything. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1415.3999999999999s)]
*  Can we show you in our more than 100 page report the documented receipts of money going [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1416.92s)]
*  into Donald Trump, but you don't care about it? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1421.92s)]
*  In other words, you don't care about the principle that our government leaders should not be [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1423.8400000000001s)]
*  on the take from foreign governments. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1428.52s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1430.4s)]
*  Amidst House Republicans' as yet utterly unproven and undemonstrated claims of President Joe [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1431.4s)]
*  Biden taking illicit funds, again, which they accused he was doing not when he was [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1437.24s)]
*  president to be clear, Congressman Jamie Raskin and other House Democrats issued a 100 page [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1440.44s)]
*  report showing that, quote, as president, Donald Trump accepted more than seven point [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1444.48s)]
*  eight million dollars from foreign states and their leaders, including some of the world's [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1448.44s)]
*  most unsavory regimes. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1452.64s)]
*  Today, Raskin wrote a letter to Donald Trump himself. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1454.72s)]
*  Please, sir, quote, immediately return to the American people. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1457.56s)]
*  The seven million eight hundred eighty six thousand seventy two dollars. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1460.68s)]
*  We know you've accepted from foreign governments in violation of the U.S. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1467.04s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1470.2s)]
*  on the Oversight Committee. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1474.4799999999998s)]
*  Congressman, we played that clip of Trump asked about it, sort of asked about it at [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  the sort of campaign rally he did in coordination with Fox. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1479.8799999999999s)]
*  And I mean, he doesn't deny it, right? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1483.56s)]
*  Like, this is not I don't think the facts are in dispute here. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1486.6s)]
*  I don't think anyone disputes the facts as documented in your report. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1489.4799999999998s)]
*  Now, he was bragging about it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  His narcissism always interferes with his legal defenses, but he openly embraced it [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  and said he did a lot for that money. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1502.2s)]
*  And indeed, he did. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1503.64s)]
*  If you read our report, you will see how he basically killed an investigation [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1504.76s)]
*  and sanctions against ICBC, the Chinese state owned company that was renting [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1509.48s)]
*  space from him and paying him lots and lots of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1516.0s)]
*  Everybody knows the way he covered up for the homicidal crown prince of Saudi Arabia, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1523.0800000000002s)]
*  who also was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1528.8000000000002s)]
*  At Trump's hotels, golf courses and so on. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1532.64s)]
*  And of course, the big payoff came later with the two billion dollars to his son in law, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1535.76s)]
*  to Jared Kushner. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1541.8400000000001s)]
*  But the bottom line is there's really no defenses out there. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1543.64s)]
*  I mean, his sons have said a couple of things like, well, he didn't take his federal [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1547.0800000000002s)]
*  salary. I'm sorry, but that's all you're allowed to take. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1551.28s)]
*  Four hundred thousand dollars from American citizens, not from Saudi monarchs and [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1554.96s)]
*  Chinese government bureaucrats. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1561.12s)]
*  You know, you can't take money from United Arab Emirates and Kuwait and Qatar and all of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1563.1599999999999s)]
*  the countries that we enumerate in our report. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1567.6799999999998s)]
*  We're talking about millions of dollars. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1570.08s)]
*  So we want it back. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1571.84s)]
*  He's not allowed to keep a dime of it without coming to Congress first. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1573.9599999999998s)]
*  He never came to Congress. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1577.84s)]
*  And they've been covering up for this for seven years. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1579.04s)]
*  And when we finally got the Supreme Court to rule for us and then the district court to [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1582.36s)]
*  do an order, we had four months of compliance before Chairman Comer shut it down, at least [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1587.48s)]
*  according to Trump's lawyers, who said he shut it down. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1592.96s)]
*  We're getting now a mixed message on that. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1596.88s)]
*  Maybe Trump's lawyers lied, in which case Chairman Comer should make it very clear that [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1599.68s)]
*  Mazar's has to continue to comply. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1603.96s)]
*  In any event, we know of seven point eight million dollars that belongs to the American [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1606.1200000000001s)]
*  people and not in Donald Trump's pockets. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1610.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, this this report was issued amidst the context, again, of this sort of fishing [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1612.96s)]
*  expedition we've been on for as we play the youth now for over a year with the Republicans [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1616.96s)]
*  saying there's this grave crime of foreign money flowing to Joe Biden, which, again, they [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1621.52s)]
*  have not demonstrated. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1624.8400000000001s)]
*  And also, you know, they're considering impeachment, even though it didn't happen when he was [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1626.48s)]
*  president. They've been chasing Hunter Biden around. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1629.88s)]
*  Again, I've sort of become convinced. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1632.64s)]
*  I used to think this was about the scandal that they found sort of politically useful. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1634.08s)]
*  It's partly that it generates content for Fox News. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1639.16s)]
*  I now really think it is like a weird form of kind of like trying to essentially like [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1641.52s)]
*  psychologically torture Joe Biden with this like humiliate ritual humiliation of his son, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1646.44s)]
*  essentially. But but but there's a response now where they voted to hold him to contempt as [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  he was sitting in front of them. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  In your committee, saying I'm here if you want to talk to me. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  And there's a new letter now to James Comer, who's the chair of that committee, from his [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  lawyer, basically saying, look, we'll find we'll come in for deposition. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1669.3200000000002s)]
*  You got to reissue the subpoena in a letter to Congress. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  Mr. Biden's lawyer, Abby Lowell, argued the subpoenas do not carry legal weight because they [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1674.68s)]
*  were authorized before the House had voted to open an impeachment investigation into President [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1678.64s)]
*  Biden. If you issue a new proper subpoena, now there's a duly authorized impeachment inquiry. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1682.0400000000002s)]
*  Mr. Biden will comply for a hearing or deposition. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1686.1200000000001s)]
*  Mr. Lowell wrote. What do you make of this development? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1688.44s)]
*  Well, he's right. I mean, it's characteristic of the sloppy investigation and legal work that [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1692.3200000000002s)]
*  they're doing. In any event, Hunter Biden repeatedly acted in good faith to substantially [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  comply with everything they were asking for. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1703.92s)]
*  I mean, we would have loved to have had Steve Bannon or Jim Jordan or Scott Perry remotely [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1706.3200000000002s)]
*  comply as much as Hunter Biden did, because the Hunter's people basically said, we'll come in, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1711.92s)]
*  we'll negotiate. And then when Chairman Comer went out on TV and basically taunted him saying, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1717.0800000000002s)]
*  you can come before the committee, before the whole world, or you can come deposition, you [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1723.48s)]
*  choose one or the other, but come on in and you talk to us. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1728.24s)]
*  And they said, fine, we'll come in. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1731.3200000000002s)]
*  And as you know, they've showed up in person several times, but no longer did Chairman Comer [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1732.52s)]
*  want that. They wanted the secret behind the door deposition. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1736.96s)]
*  So basically what his lawyer has said is, go ahead and issue a valid subpoena now that you [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1740.28s)]
*  finally got the votes for an impeachment inquiry and we'll do whichever one you want, a [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1747.88s)]
*  deposition or in front of the committee. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, obviously he's got his own special counsel, so everything is either out there and [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1755.8s)]
*  going to be out there on Hunter Biden. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1761.4s)]
*  And all of it is a massive distraction from the fact that they haven't laid a glove on President [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1764.0s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1769.68s)]
*  There's other doings happening now that Congress is back. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1771.16s)]
*  And there's a there's a parent deal that was struck over the break with Mike Johnson's [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1774.24s)]
*  speaker and I think Chuck Schumer and representatives of the White House for a bill that [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1779.32s)]
*  would fund the government. It adheres to the previous deal made by Kevin McCarthy last year, where [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1783.6s)]
*  they said, here are the top line numbers. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1788.04s)]
*  We're going to come to agreement. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1790.04s)]
*  We're going to fund the government at these levels. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1791.12s)]
*  It's a deal that a sort of part of the Republican caucus hates. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1793.0s)]
*  They're now screaming they've been betrayed again. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1797.1599999999999s)]
*  We're just going through this kind of eternal recurrence with this. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1799.2s)]
*  They're talking about maybe a motion to vacate. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1802.52s)]
*  Is that going to like are we just going to go through this again? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1805.12s)]
*  That may be our destiny this year. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1811.28s)]
*  I mean, they said they've given they'll give him a little bit of time because they don't [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1813.4s)]
*  basically want to perform surgery on the same patient too close in time to each other. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1817.4s)]
*  I mean, the extraordinary thing is that Mike Johnson said today, well, he's sticking by the [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1822.8000000000002s)]
*  deal, but he seems to be only speaking for himself. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1827.48s)]
*  In other words, he's not speaking as the leader of his party who's saying we will abide by our [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  deal. He's saying I will stick to it. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1835.64s)]
*  But he's not assuring that he won't lose 15 or 20 votes with the wreckage of the Freedom [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1837.72s)]
*  Caucus rolling all over him. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  And so this is what we have been dealing with from the beginning. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1846.28s)]
*  There's no coherence over there because there's no program. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1850.2s)]
*  They have no positive vision for the country. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1853.8s)]
*  It's all Donald Trump calling them up and telling them, do this, do that, go after Joe Biden, go [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1856.0s)]
*  after Hunter Biden. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1861.8s)]
*  They're not acting like a political party. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1863.52s)]
*  As we've said, it's like a religious cult. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1865.2s)]
*  And I've told the Republicans when all this is over, they're basically going to be selling [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1867.3200000000002s)]
*  flowers and incense at Dulles Airport for the rest of their lives. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1871.52s)]
*  Correct. Congressman Jamie Raskin. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1875.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  We have some breaking news that just came in. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1879.44s)]
*  According to two U.S. defense officials, the United States has conducted another strike [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1881.8000000000002s)]
*  against the Houthi rebel group in Yemen. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1886.2s)]
*  Now, this is the second strike in just over 24 hours on that militant group that's based in [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1888.4s)]
*  Yemen, receives backing from the state of Iran, and it follows months of increasing [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1893.04s)]
*  attacks on ships transiting the Red Sea. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1898.0s)]
*  The Houthis say those attacks are in response to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza following [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1900.04s)]
*  the October 7th attacks. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1905.44s)]
*  Joining me now is NBC News Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kubbe. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1906.92s)]
*  Courtney, I never got a sense of what targets were hit last night. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1910.0s)]
*  There were huge demonstrations, I believe, in Yemen today about them. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1915.1599999999999s)]
*  Do we know what targets were hit today? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1917.92s)]
*  We do. So we know a little bit more about last night and tonight. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1920.8000000000002s)]
*  So tonight first, they hit once just one target. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1924.0s)]
*  It was a radar site. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1926.68s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that radar was used for. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1927.76s)]
*  But just to give you a sense, they can be used for everything to help the Houthis target [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1929.52s)]
*  with their ballistic missiles, for air defenses. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1934.3200000000002s)]
*  Just depends on the site. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1937.0800000000002s)]
*  This is literally breaking. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1938.28s)]
*  Just in the last moments, the strike occurred in the last hour here, Chris. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1939.68s)]
*  So as far as last night goes, the huge difference between tonight and last night is just the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1943.44s)]
*  scale. There were more than 150 precision guided bombs and missiles that were [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1948.96s)]
*  launched at the Houthi areas in Yemen last night, and they struck a number of targets, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1955.0s)]
*  more than 60, really degrading the Houthis capabilities to carry out the sorts of attacks [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1961.0s)]
*  in the Red Sea that we've been hearing about for weeks now. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1966.68s)]
*  So things like other radar sites, warehouses where they store their drones and their [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1969.16s)]
*  munitions, air defense systems. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind, if the U.S. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1976.56s)]
*  and the British military and others want to keep attacking the Houthis, if this becomes [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1977.92s)]
*  more of a tit for tat, well, they want to have the ability to fly manned aircraft in. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1983.52s)]
*  They need to go off their air defense system. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1988.24s)]
*  So those sorts of things. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1989.92s)]
*  But the real key here is the U.S. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1991.4s)]
*  and the British military. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1993.88s)]
*  They had a goal of trying to degrade the Houthis ability to carry out the sorts of [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=1995.32s)]
*  attacks they have been that we have seen them conducting in the Red Sea. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2000.88s)]
*  That includes mainly one way drone attacks, anti-ship cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2004.4s)]
*  So there to that same end, we've also saw them attack a bunch or strike a bunch of [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2010.4s)]
*  launchers last night where they'd be firing off many of these missiles. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2014.32s)]
*  So the key here that we should remember is last night's strikes were they really [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2017.6s)]
*  degraded the Houthis capability just because of the scale, the number of locations that [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2023.92s)]
*  were struck here, Chris. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2029.52s)]
*  I'm going to ask what may sound like a naive question, but I'm just going to ask it because [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2030.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2034.4s)]
*  Are these situated like in the middle of urban environments and residential areas? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2035.76s)]
*  Are they situated out in what are essentially like known Houthi bases? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2041.04s)]
*  Like what like just, you know, the government says one thing and I, you know, I have no [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2045.76s)]
*  reason specifically to doubt them. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2050.08s)]
*  But like when missiles go up in the air, you want to know where they fall. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2051.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2055.12s)]
*  And I would hope the military knows where they're falling, too, frankly. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2056.08s)]
*  I will say the majority of the targets last night were in much more rural areas. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2059.52s)]
*  So think about a launcher that's up on a mountain. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2063.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2066.8s)]
*  So there's not a lot of people around. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2066.96s)]
*  That being said, we don't know where all the targets were last night. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2068.48s)]
*  We don't even really know. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2072.8s)]
*  It's not we believe there were 28 separate locations, more than 60 targets at those [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2073.6800000000003s)]
*  locations. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2078.6400000000003s)]
*  But all we really have is a rough idea of the sorts of things that they went after a [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2079.6000000000004s)]
*  couple of the areas that they that they hit. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2084.0s)]
*  But what we have been told is most of them were in more rural areas. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2086.16s)]
*  But you mentioned bases. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2089.6s)]
*  Remember, the Yemen, the Houthis actually control a large portion of this part of Yemen. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2091.2s)]
*  And they do have military bases there. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2098.3999999999996s)]
*  Some of the targets actually were either near or on those Houthi military bases. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2100.72s)]
*  Another question. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2106.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's a there's a ceasefire that's been negotiated recently in that ongoing [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2107.52s)]
*  eight year war, sort of civil war in Yemen, but also essentially a proxy war between the [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2111.44s)]
*  Saudis and the Iranians who are backing different factions, the Saudis backing the Yemen [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2116.0s)]
*  government, which was essentially a kind of client state, the Iranians backing the Houthis. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2120.32s)]
*  There's been a ceasefire that American diplomats have worked very hard on and wanted to [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2124.64s)]
*  preserve. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2127.68s)]
*  The Houthis are saying they are doing this, these firing at these commercial ships as [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2128.88s)]
*  a means of blockading the Red Sea in response to the Israeli attacks on Gaza. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2132.88s)]
*  Are there U.S. diplomatic channels with the Houthi? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2137.28s)]
*  Like, is there like obviously there's missiles flying, but are there people talking behind [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2139.92s)]
*  the scenes? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2144.0s)]
*  There are. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  And we have there are U.S. officials, including the special envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2145.92s)]
*  who have been working on what they have really hoped for almost two years now would end up [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  being what they call a lasting ceasefire, an enduring ceasefire. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2156.88s)]
*  I will say the ceasefire between the Saudis and the Houthis has held for it's been a year [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2160.72s)]
*  and a half, almost two years now. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2165.2s)]
*  So it has been holding. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2167.04s)]
*  And that's one of the real concerns here is this Houthi action that has really stepped [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2168.08s)]
*  up in the last two months. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2172.0s)]
*  There's a worry that that's going to break that ceasefire and that we're going to start [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2173.2799999999997s)]
*  seeing another civil war, which I'm sure you remember, Chris, just had unbelievably [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2177.12s)]
*  traumatic humanitarian impact. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2182.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was it was the the children and the civilians in Yemen that suffered for years [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2184.7999999999997s)]
*  under that civil war. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2190.8799999999997s)]
*  So everyone wants to avoid that. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2191.9199999999996s)]
*  But that being said, right now, the U.S. is has taken very careful steps here to ensure [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2194.08s)]
*  that the strikes that they took here, the goal is not to provoke a larger conflict. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2200.16s)]
*  In fact, the goal is to deter one. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2205.04s)]
*  Chris. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2206.7999999999997s)]
*  All right, Courtney and Kubi, that was really informative. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2207.04s)]
*  Thank you very much for making some time. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2208.96s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2210.24s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2210.8799999999997s)]
*  In 1994, writer Isabel Wilkerson became the first black woman to be awarded the Pulitzer [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2216.24s)]
*  Prize in Journalism for a feature article she wrote in the New York Times on a 10-year-old [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2221.12s)]
*  black boy on Chicago's South Side and her coverage of the 1993 Midwestern floods. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2224.48s)]
*  Nearly 20 years later in 2010, she wrote The Warmth of Other Suns, an instant classic, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2229.6s)]
*  won a whole bunch of awards. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2234.96s)]
*  It's about the black migration north through much of the 20th century. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2236.72s)]
*  An incredible book. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2240.08s)]
*  Can't recommend it highly enough. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2240.88s)]
*  Then in 2020, she followed that up with Cast, The Origins Are Discontents, an epic exploration [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2242.24s)]
*  of the nature of not just American racial hierarchy, but hierarchy across the world [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2248.16s)]
*  over spans of time and place. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2252.88s)]
*  And I was lucky enough to talk to her about her hopes for the book on my podcast, Why [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2254.48s)]
*  Is This Happening? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2258.56s)]
*  This actually is not an argument. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2261.12s)]
*  This is an invitation to look at ourselves differently, an invitation to understanding [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2264.96s)]
*  what we might not have seen or known about ourselves before. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2272.2400000000002s)]
*  In fact, could not have known because these things are not taught, the connections have [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2274.96s)]
*  not been made, and this is an attempt to make connections that otherwise we would not see. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2279.44s)]
*  So that's how I look at it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2284.16s)]
*  It's filled with stories to allow a person to be able to see for oneself what I'm presenting. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2286.3999999999996s)]
*  Then an amazing turn of events, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay got the rights to the [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2296.16s)]
*  book, Cast, and then rather than make a documentary or a series like her 13th for Netflix, about [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2300.72s)]
*  the 13th Amendment, she's produced an original feature film titled Origin that sort of tracks [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2306.24s)]
*  the story of Wilkerson writing the book interlaced with its themes. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2311.3599999999997s)]
*  Slavery lasted 246 years. That's 13 generations of people [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2316.48s)]
*  plus another hundred years of Jim Crow segregation, violence, and murder. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2323.52s)]
*  It is, of course, horrific. I am not downplaying any of it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2328.48s)]
*  There were so many millions of African Americans who were murdered [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2331.9199999999996s)]
*  from the Middle Passage until the end of legal segregation that it goes beyond the realm of [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2339.9199999999996s)]
*  an official number. There is no number. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2345.36s)]
*  I didn't know that. Stunning. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2353.84s)]
*  Origin's already been getting Oscar buzz and rave reviews from everyone from Opal Winfrey [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2357.52s)]
*  to Lin-Manuel Miranda. It is set for wide release next week, January 19th, and Ava DuVernay, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2361.76s)]
*  the writer, director, and producer of the film, joins me now. Great to have you here. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2366.88s)]
*  Happy to be here. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2369.92s)]
*  Phenomenal film that I got to watch today that's I would say almost unlike any other thing I've [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2371.68s)]
*  seen. I want to start with occasionally I will hear news in Hollywood that so and so is making [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2376.56s)]
*  a film out of this thing. There's two that I thought of. The big short, when Adam McKay [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2381.92s)]
*  was going to make sure, I was like, how are you going to make that? And Barbie, I was like, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2387.12s)]
*  how are you going to make that? And Cass, which I had read, I was like, how are you going to make [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2390.0s)]
*  that into a movie? How did you conceptualize it? Well, that's the beautiful thing about [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2393.2s)]
*  film and about creativity. We can figure it out when everyone says, how do you do it? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2396.64s)]
*  And on this one, this is an anthropological thesis, truly. This is a call to action in many [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2400.16s)]
*  ways. But it's facts, it's figures, it's some anecdotes that have a few characters here and [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2407.2s)]
*  there, but not a story in the sense of I can adapt a beginning, middle, and end. So I was hunting [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2410.48s)]
*  for the way in. I knew I didn't want to make a documentary. Documentaries are what I use to [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2417.2799999999997s)]
*  convey information. I wanted people to feel emotion and empathy. And so the best way to do [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2421.2s)]
*  that is with actors. So I started searching for characters in the book. I thought maybe I'll make [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2426.08s)]
*  it like Crash, you know, that film, interlocking stories. I was trying to think of all the ways to [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2430.16s)]
*  do it. And then Isabel started to rise from the pages because occasionally she'll use first person [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2435.36s)]
*  to describe her research and what she's doing to put these pieces together. So I started to look [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2440.24s)]
*  in the places where she said, I did this, my journey here, and started to think, wow, what if [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2444.64s)]
*  she guided us through? And what I love about it is that the story ends up becoming her putting the [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2449.2s)]
*  pieces together in some ways. It was sort of emerging from a wreckage of a whole personal [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2453.2s)]
*  tragedy she went through. And then it kind of interweaves. So you sort of transport from Nazi [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2457.8399999999997s)]
*  Germany to India, to her, you know, her vision of it. The other question I had was like, how you got [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2462.64s)]
*  the film made? Because again, like, you're like, oh, I have cast, right? This is like, it's not the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2469.52s)]
*  hot studio pitch. It's not the hot studio pitch. It's not like, it's not transparent. No, it's no [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2474.24s)]
*  cape. No one's in a cape. There's no superhero. But there is a superhero. She is a superhero. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2478.96s)]
*  Anjaneu Ellis-Taylor, who is the outstanding lead in the film. She does a remarkable job. She's [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2484.48s)]
*  incredible. She said that she felt like an intellectual Indiana Jones. Yeah, it has that, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2489.2s)]
*  right. It's like a caper. Yeah, a bit of it because we're globe-shotting. We shot this [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2493.68s)]
*  film in 37 days on three continents. And so we're moving around the world, moving around time. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2498.08s)]
*  And that is not a real viable pitch for studios. I want to make a film about cast. And so we just [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2505.8399999999997s)]
*  bypassed that. You know, we didn't do a whole bunch of studio pitches. We just started to think of who [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2513.68s)]
*  were like-minded individuals, organizations that were interested in this kind of fare. And [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2518.88s)]
*  we came up with a few places, like the Ford Foundation. Yeah, the Ford Foundation. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2524.3199999999997s)]
*  And Melinda Gates and Lorene Powell Jobs and like-minded folks that are interested in this. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2530.16s)]
*  It's awesome because it looks and has a feel. The aesthetics of like a big film. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2535.2s)]
*  It is. It's a big film made by philanthropists. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2538.4s)]
*  You know, the thing that I, the sort of unlocking moment in that book, which I read and I had [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2544.16s)]
*  Wilkerson, is this sort of notion of we tend to think in narrower terms about racial hierarchy [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2549.04s)]
*  in the U.S. and the experience of slavery for obvious reasons. But the experience of hierarchy [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2553.52s)]
*  according to cast is a much broader and global phenomenon through times and space and different [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2558.16s)]
*  history. What do you want people, that to me was the kind of like key juxtaposition I walked away. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2562.88s)]
*  How do you think about this hitting your audience? I just think, you know, the knowledge of the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2568.4s)]
*  interlocking kind of connective tissue between oppressions, subjugations, you know, environments [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2573.76s)]
*  where folks are degraded and demeaned. The reason why there's so much pain around those issues is [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  because you feel isolated. You know, I know African Americans feel like no one understands, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2589.12s)]
*  you know, you know, people feel like they're in a very unique position. Jewish people as it relates [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2593.8399999999997s)]
*  to the Holocaust feel, you know, very isolated from what I've heard in terms of folks really [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2600.08s)]
*  understanding the pain. All of our pains are so specific and yes, there's a universality to it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2606.0s)]
*  If you understand that there's something underneath connecting it, it makes you feel a bit less alone. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2611.52s)]
*  That's how I felt when I read the book, that I'm connected to these people through this social [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2615.92s)]
*  phenomena and it provided a bit of, I don't know, it had a liberating quality. Yeah, I think one of [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2620.96s)]
*  the things that struck me about the book and this comes up in the movie as well is the idea that like [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2627.84s)]
*  when you are presented with another society's caste system, it seems ludicrous on its face. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2636.0s)]
*  When someone says like, oh, those are, we call them untouchable, and you're like, why? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2642.24s)]
*  Right. When you're in your own version of it, like you're so acculturated to it. Right. And so the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2646.3199999999997s)]
*  sort of transport across these different boundaries allows you to kind of like step outside your own. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2652.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's an empathy machine, but also, I mean, shocking. I had no clue, and I'm an African [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2658.3199999999997s)]
*  American studies major, to have a degree in African American studies. I had never heard about the [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2662.88s)]
*  fact that American segregation and miscegenation laws were the blueprint for [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2668.08s)]
*  protocols. That's not something that is widely taught. I remember reading that in the book and [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2675.68s)]
*  having my mind blown. And so we explore that moment in the film where she puts those pieces [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2680.4s)]
*  together. We explore how the Trayvon Martin case was really the catalyst for her to start thinking [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2685.36s)]
*  about, wait, everyone's calling this race. But there's something else going on here. It's a Latino [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2691.6s)]
*  man who stalks and kills a black boy to protect an all-white neighborhood. Does that feel neatly [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2697.52s)]
*  in the box of race? There's something else. So in just being with her and watching her investigate, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2702.8s)]
*  explore, and kind of peel back the layers of the mystery, you learn along the way. Can I ask you [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2708.88s)]
*  a question about the business, about Hollywood? Wow. Are you sure you want to? Yes. It's tough [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2714.64s)]
*  out there. Well, here's the question. You know, I think in 2020, there was this sense of like, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2718.8s)]
*  obviously, there was the George Floyd protests, Black Lives Matter movement, and this sort of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1A3VU2iCI&t=2723.44s)]
