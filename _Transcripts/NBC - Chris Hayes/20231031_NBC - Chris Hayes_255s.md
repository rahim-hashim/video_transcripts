# Rash of international antisemitism carries chilling historic hallmarks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw)
*  In the lead up to the Holocaust, the Nazi party ordered graffiti like this, which you see there, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Jewish symbol, the Star of David, to be plastered over Jewish shops and homes, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=4.96s)]
*  meant to single Jewish people out to terrify them. These photos are from 1938. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=9.68s)]
*  This is footage out of Paris, France today. Overnight, around 60 stars of David were spray [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=15.84s)]
*  painted on buildings in a southern district of Paris. Authorities in France do not know who is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=21.04s)]
*  responsible or what their motives were, but given the history of the symbol, the act is being [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=26.32s)]
*  investigated as a potential hate crime. Since Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7th, some 850 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=30.8s)]
*  anti-Semitic acts have been reported to the authorities in France. As of this Sunday, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=36.88s)]
*  France has made more than 400 arrests for anti-Semitic acts. The rise in anti-Semitism [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=41.28s)]
*  around the world since Hamas's attack on Israel earlier this month is undeniable. We've seen [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  synagogues defaced, anti-Semitic graffiti. Just tonight, a Cornell University student was arrested, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=51.84s)]
*  charged, after allegedly posting threats online that he would shoot up the university's kosher [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  dining hall. Patrick Dye, a 21-year-old junior at Cornell, allegedly posted messages online, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  threatened to stab and slit the throat of Jews on campus, among other threats. He's scheduled to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=69.76s)]
*  appear in court tomorrow and faces up to five years in prison. The October 7th attack itself [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=75.12s)]
*  was the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. The terror inflicted from that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=80.88s)]
*  attack is not just the barbarism that happened that day, but the reawakening of the deep cultural [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=85.92s)]
*  trauma of the kinds of attacks that Jewish people have faced for centuries. This weekend, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of people stormed an airport in Dagestan. This is in southern Russia. And they held signs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=96.32s)]
*  that reportedly said things like, we are against Jewish refugees, and there is no place for child [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=102.56s)]
*  killers in Dagestan. This was after reports of an inbound flight from Israel. They pushed past [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=106.96s)]
*  security. They went onto the tarmac. They were looking for what they believed to be was a plane [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  filled with Jews from Israel, a plane that social media posts signaled out and urged them to confront. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=117.52s)]
*  Full mob scene. Thankfully, they did not find what they were looking for. But still, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=124.88s)]
*  at least 20 people were injured. Dozens more were arrested. This event in Dagestan has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  called a lot of different things by the press, a protest, a riot, a mob. But there is a very [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=135.2s)]
*  specific word for exactly this kind of ethnically targeted violent mob behavior, particularly against [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  Jews, particularly against Jews in Russia, a pogrom. Before the Holocaust, the worst massacre [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=146.32s)]
*  of Jewish people was actually a series of hundreds of massacres or pogroms carried out for the Russian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=153.28s)]
*  Empire and in Europe that killed tens of thousands of Jews over a series of decades. Some of the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=158.0s)]
*  images we're about to show you are pretty disturbing, so if you'd like to turn away now, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=164.48s)]
*  you can do so. We've also blurred some of the faces to make these images less graphic. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  But the horrific nature of these events are a part of this history. We don't want to obscure that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Like what happened in Dagestan this weekend, pogroms were often mobs of civilians [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=180.16s)]
*  ginned up on some paranoid anti-Semitic media who sought out Jews specifically to punish them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  collectively for decades. Jewish people had their homes destroyed, their properties stolen, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=191.76s)]
*  their families murdered just because they were Jewish. There was always some conspiracy tied to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=196.32s)]
*  it all, like when Russians blamed the Jews for the assassination of the Russian Tsar in 1881. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  There's also just a deep-seated prejudice against Jewish people that made scapegoating them [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=207.76s)]
*  like that tragically easy. There is now a tragic and enraging surfeit of evidence from around the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=211.92s)]
*  world that this is still the case. Processing the actions of the Israeli government is not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitic, but chasing and harassing Jewish people for any reason in pursuit of any alleged [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=225.36s)]
*  cause is, and its roots are deep as they are evil. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFZTxAJ5sw&t=230.4s)]
