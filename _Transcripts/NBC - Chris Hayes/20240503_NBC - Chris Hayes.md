# Kristi Noem roasted by Trump Jr., Bannon over dog killing revelation
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs)
*  South Dakota's Republican Governor, Christy Noem, was so dead set on being Trump's vice president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=0.0s)]
*  she didn't run against him in the primary, even though there was some talk that she might be a contender in that primary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=4.8s)]
*  Instead, she just launched herself directly into the Veep Stakes, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  running that ad you just saw during the first Republican primary debate on Fox News, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=13.4s)]
*  with the clear hope that Donald Trump would be watching and see it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=19.0s)]
*  The official South Dakota state website even published a press release announcing the ad ran during the debate, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=22.0s)]
*  just in case anyone missed it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=28.2s)]
*  Noem has been running multiple ads on Fox, again, ostensibly touting jobs in her state, but really touting herself. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=30.2s)]
*  And that campaign for the number two slot was supposed to kick off improper next week with the release of her new memoir, No Going Back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=37.0s)]
*  Now, in Noem's defense, the book is generating her a bunch of headlines, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=45.0s)]
*  like, for instance, quote, Christy Noem describes executing puppy she hated in New Book, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=48.2s)]
*  and, quote, South Dakota Governor Christy Noem defends her account of killing own dog in New Book, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=53.1s)]
*  and, finally, quote, Christy Noem's VP chances appear as dead as the dog she killed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=58.5s)]
*  Now, I will admit, I am not a professional political consultant, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=64.2s)]
*  but I'm pretty sure proud puppy killer is not what most Americans want from their vice president. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=66.7s)]
*  Tara Setmire worked as a Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=72.2s)]
*  now senior advisor for the Lincoln Project, and she joins me now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=75.8s)]
*  Tara, I should just lay out, her account is that she had a dog. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=79.1s)]
*  It was a hunting dog. It was a puppy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=83.1s)]
*  I think about 14 months, if I'm not mistaken, that it twice attacked animals, and then she shot it in a gravel pit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=84.6s)]
*  She also shot a goat. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=91.6s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of horses they had to put down. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, first, what do you think about the politics of this? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  I think the headlines you just ran speak for themselves. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=102.6s)]
*  I mean, Chris, these are horrible people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=106.6s)]
*  They're just awful. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Their nihilism and their bloodlust is pathological at this point, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=112.6s)]
*  because really the cruelty is the point in MAGA, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=117.3s)]
*  And this is a perfect example of that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Christy Noem can make any excuse she wants. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=123.5s)]
*  She can try and walk it back all she wants or blame it on the fake news media all she wants or blame it on her ghostwriter, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  or the editors, or the publishers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=131.9s)]
*  But no, she made the choice to put this in her book, a book that she has already audio voice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=133.6s)]
*  There's an audio version of it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=139.9s)]
*  So she was well aware of what was all in it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=141.4s)]
*  And she just made the decision to brag about being a puppy executioner. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  It's sadistic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=149.5s)]
*  And she's out here trying to be a political clout chaser, basically trying to curry favor with Donald Trump in some weird sadistic way, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=151.0s)]
*  because he's a horrible and decent person. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=159.4s)]
*  So she's bragging about being a horrible and decent person who will do the hard things by shooting her puppy in a gravel pit. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=162.0s)]
*  This is just a perfect example of MAGA. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=169.5s)]
*  And frankly, I hope that MAGA's ilk is thrown into the gravel pit of history after November this year, because that's where it belongs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=171.6s)]
*  It's sickening. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=181.1s)]
*  You mean the ideology. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=182.0s)]
*  That's a metaphor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=183.2s)]
*  I just want to be clear because we're shooting a dog here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=184.0s)]
*  That's a metaphor about the ideology. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=186.1s)]
*  All metaphorically. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=187.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=188.7s)]
*  It's just important. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=189.2s)]
*  You're actually from a family of I learned this today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=190.7s)]
*  You're from a family of dog handlers and came up as a young as a girl, like showing dog. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=193.6s)]
*  Like your family, the family business was showing dogs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=199.2s)]
*  That right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=201.6s)]
*  Yeah, my grandmother was a basically like a Hall of Fame dog show handler. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=203.0s)]
*  She handled Pomeranian. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=207.6s)]
*  She showed at Westminster, the prestigious Westminster dog show. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Many times she trained field and rescue German Shepherds when she was younger. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=211.6s)]
*  When my grandfather was on the police force in my hometown in Paramus, New Jersey, and she was in the women's auxiliary. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=216.7s)]
*  My grandmother was a tough cookie. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  She's only about five foot one. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=222.6s)]
*  And my aunt is a championship nationally recognized obedience trainer and have dogs that are obedience champions right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=224.4s)]
*  And she's competing in Westminster in 10 days from now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  And my mom was a vet tech for 12 years and I was a junior handler and also showed at Westminster. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=235.4s)]
*  So yes, we I come from a family of dog lovers trainers and handlers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  I wish your aunt and Kristi no man crossed paths years ago with with with the little with the the the the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  puppy that she shot in the in the gravel pit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=254.2s)]
*  By the way, just her first response was to say like, oh, you city slickers don't understand life on the farm. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=256.4s)]
*  She said we love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=262.2s)]
*  Sadly, we just had to put down three horses a few weeks ago that have been in our family for 25 years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  If you want more real honest and politically incorrect stories that will have the media gasping pre-order no going back. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=270.4s)]
*  But and this to me is the key. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=277.4s)]
*  The key thing about this and I want I want to play this clip of Bannon and Don Jr. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=279.0s)]
*  Because what's clear again, this is a this is a PR document. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=283.5s)]
*  This is not she's not trying to win the National Book Award for you know, for for memoir. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=287.5s)]
*  OK, this is this is a campaign document. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=292.5s)]
*  It's included everything that is included to tell a story to curry favor with the kinds of folks the voters that she wants. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=294.9s)]
*  And I think she thought that they would like the puppy killing story. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=301.8s)]
*  And I think it's so revealing what Bannon and Don Jr. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=305.3s)]
*  Say about it. Take a listen. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=308.7s)]
*  I've always been an advocate of a of a of a of a woman as a VP because I think you have some strong woman. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=311.2s)]
*  Although Kristi Noem, I think is maybe a little too based shooting them shooting the puppy in the in the gravel. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=317.8s)]
*  I was not ideal. Yeah, not ideal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=324.0s)]
*  I got to ask you that. Who put that in the book? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=326.3s)]
*  Like I think I was like your your ghostwriter must really not like you if they get to include that one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=328.5s)]
*  Tara, I just think him saying it's a little too based is so perfect because based is a term of like, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=333.8s)]
*  you know, a good thing in their world. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=339.8s)]
*  It's the opposite of woke like based bases like hardcore and like him saying it's too base is him admitting that he thought that she thought it would look based to kill your puppy and then surprise it backfired. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=341.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I say that there the cruelty is the point has gone too far here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=353.6s)]
*  Right. Like these people, the bloodlust is sadistic that they would actually like this, that she made the political calculation to put in being a puppy executioner as a positive. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=358.8s)]
*  Like there's it's not when you've lost when you've lost Steve Bannon, Don Jr. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=369.5s)]
*  and Judge Jeanine and, you know, Kimberly Guilfoyle and like the Maga of the Maga like you've lost you've lost it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=374.3s)]
*  Yeah. So she's just when you thought it couldn't go too far. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=381.4s)]
*  I mean the American people they don't come together on many things. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=384.3s)]
*  But being a puppy executioner, I think is something that everyone can agree is disqualifies you from holding any higher office. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=387.3s)]
*  That might be a 90, 90 10 kind of issue, although we'll say for I always talk to writers, young writers, particularly about good writing details or what make good writing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=394.1s)]
*  And I will say gravel pit is really what that's going to stick in your head. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=401.5s)]
*  Greta gravel pit. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=405.6s)]
*  Tara Sattmeyer. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=406.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=407.1s)]
*  You [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykIO6ZFMUs&t=424.0s)]
