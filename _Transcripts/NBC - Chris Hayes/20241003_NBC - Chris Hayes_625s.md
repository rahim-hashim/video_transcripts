# Liz Cheney campaigns with Harris, urges voters to reject 'depraved cruelty' of Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've been watching the scene in Rippon, Wisconsin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the birthplace the Republican Party shortly before the Civil War before the election of Abraham Lincoln [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=4.76s)]
*  And it's the place where former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney just joined Kamala Harris vice president for a joint campaign appearance [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=9.44s)]
*  Taking to the stage amid chants of thank you Liz Cheney endorsed the vice president and laid out the stakes of this election. I [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=17.88s)]
*  Tell you I have never voted for a Democrat [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=26.36s)]
*  But this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=30.28s)]
*  As we meet here today our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=39.04s)]
*  former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=46.36s)]
*  foundations of our Republic by refusing to accept the lawful results [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election. We cannot turn away from this truth in this election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration. It is our duty [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=65.72s)]
*  Now to say the obvious personally, I don't agree with a lot of Liz Cheney's politics [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=74.44s)]
*  I imagine a lot of you watching feel the same way. In fact, that's a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=77.84s)]
*  Basically, I oppose just about everything she's advocated for in the course of her public life [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=81.32s)]
*  Except one thing except one thing the most important thing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  This is someone who put her whole political career her future in the Republican Party a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=90.68s)]
*  Party to which she was born right and heiress in a sense. She put it on the line for American democracy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  She's someone who believes Donald Trump is a unique threat [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was willing to sacrifice our capital to allow law enforcement officers to be beaten and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=107.6s)]
*  brutalized in his name and to violate the law and the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=114.32s)]
*  Constitution in order to seize power for himself. I don't care if you are a Democrat or a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=119.6s)]
*  Republican or an independent that is depravity and we must never become numb to it any [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=127.6s)]
*  Person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=134.72s)]
*  Now the health and the future of American democracy is very clearly obviously on the ballot this election [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=141.32s)]
*  But just because something is important like whether we're gonna be a democracy or not. It doesn't necessarily mean it's good campaign fodder [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  There is reason to believe though that just like two years ago running on this core message like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=154.28s)]
*  We're Americans. We're democracy and want to keep that going [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=160.04s)]
*  That's a winning message. Take a look at this. This is a graph from 2022 the green line on this graph shows [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=162.52s)]
*  President Joe Biden's approval rating [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  From the time he took office in January 2021 to September of 2022 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=171.68s)]
*  You could see was going pretty steadily down until the end of that summer [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=176.52s)]
*  2022 when it picks up and reverses course [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=180.24s)]
*  You see that little just tick up in the in the bottom there [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  Now this trend came in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision at the end of the year [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=186.12s)]
*  President Biden's decision at the end of June [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=190.92s)]
*  Overturning Roe v. Wade course over the course of June July millions of Americans also watched eight hearings held by the January 6th committee [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  and so with the midterm elections approaching but President Biden Democrats saw where the mood of the country was and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  They definitely ran on those issues abortion and particular democracy [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Remember that just ahead of Labor Day weekend. Remember this speech we took it live [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  I think it's just ahead of Labor Day weekend President Biden delivered this prime time address in front of Independence Hall [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=216.08s)]
*  Warning that our democracy was at stake [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=221.6s)]
*  For a long time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=226.32s)]
*  We've told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=228.4s)]
*  But it's not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=232.96s)]
*  We have to defend it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=234.72s)]
*  Protect it stand up for it each and every one of us [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=236.8s)]
*  That's why tonight [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=242.4s)]
*  I'm asking our nation to come together [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=244.16s)]
*  Unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=247.12s)]
*  Now remember at the time really just this discourse around this right it wasn't clear if that message was going to work [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=257.2s)]
*  Sort of an open question [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=263.12s)]
*  And there were a lot of people out there who thought that it was out of touch [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Or or tone deaf or even elitist that that real voters real people really only cared about grocery prices [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=268.24s)]
*  And they were wrong [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=274.24s)]
*  Biden and democrats defied all the expectations. They pulled off a historic win for a still relatively unpopular incumbent president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=275.68s)]
*  The democrats bet and won two years ago on the idea [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=284.48s)]
*  that it's actually [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  condescending to think that ordinary people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=290.06s)]
*  plumbers cab drivers teachers nurses [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  Don't understand or care about democracy. What that's too highfalutin for them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Of course working people people without a lot of money people without formal education [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=302.64s)]
*  They're smart [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=308.32s)]
*  In fact, the reason we have a democracy in the first place is because we trust that all of us together can make these decisions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  I think the majority of people of all different kinds of walks of life all different levels of formal education credentials [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=317.84s)]
*  Don't want a dictatorship [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=324.96s)]
*  I think if you force the issue in those terms the pro-democracy side wins and that again [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=327.28s)]
*  That was the message and it worked in 2022. So here we are again two years later this time around [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=332.88s)]
*  The other side knows believe me. They know [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=339.12s)]
*  That january 6th the images of the men bashing the cop's brains in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  The attempt to overthrow the american republic is an enormous political liability [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=348.96s)]
*  Instead of engaging with it or admitting to it they are just desperately trying to run away from it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=354.58s)]
*  Did he lose the 2020 election tim i'm focused on the future did camila harris [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=361.22s)]
*  Censor americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=366.74s)]
*  Covid situation that is a damning that is a damning non-answer [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=371.06s)]
*  That is a damning non-answer [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=375.62s)]
*  Republican house majority whip tom emmer from minnesota where tim walsh's fund has been running around blaming the media [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=377.38s)]
*  It's the media's fault for being obsessed with donald trump's attempted coup [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=383.38s)]
*  Did you think he'd get that question did you did you talk about how to answer the 2020 question [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=388.98s)]
*  Listen this is a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=395.7s)]
*  Again, he answered it. You don't like the answer, but he answered it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  This is something that you folks in the media want to focus on on a regular basis [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  The american people and thank goodness jd vance and donald trump [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=406.42s)]
*  Are focused on the election and how to fix this country again caitlyn we're talking about an election [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=410.58s)]
*  That's going to take place in 35 days [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  What are you doing talking about something that's four years ago? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=418.58s)]
*  We can have this debate still talking about some other time going forward the people the people are hurting [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=421.38s)]
*  Okay, that's a tell right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=427.54s)]
*  You don't have to like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=430.1s)]
*  Be particularly read into politics to understand the gentleman on the right of your screen doesn't want to talk about it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=431.62s)]
*  Because it's bad for him because the guy who's effectively his boss [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=437.06s)]
*  Summoned a violent mob to try to end american democracy [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=441.62s)]
*  So they want to change the subject because they understand again a majority of the country wants to preserve american democracy [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  Of course donald trump himself is a bit of a different story [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  He is too obsessed with the whole thing to ever drop it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=454.73999999999995s)]
*  It was a rigged election [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=459.46s)]
*  You have to tell kamala harris, that's why i'm doing it again if I thought I lost I wouldn't be doing this again [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=461.46s)]

*  Be having a nice life [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=472.26s)]
*  All right, you see that little thing that we put up on the screen to let you know when that was that was today [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  We're not running file footage today in saginaw, michigan a few days after tom hemmer was yelling about how the media is obsessed with it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald trump is talking about the 2020 rigged election and there's a reason that has not worked for trump [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=486.98s)]
*  And it's while while the pro-democracy message has been so salient no matter our background our income or education level our positions on things [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=492.58s)]
*  I do think americans believe [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=500.42s)]
*  Fundamentally a majority of us in our democratic experiment and wanted to continue [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=502.56s)]
*  So here we are 33 days ago donald trump and his authoritarian aims [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=508.82s)]
*  On the ballot once again jd vance pledging to do whatever it takes on donald trump's behalf up to and including [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=514.02s)]
*  Overturning elections. He's on the record with the help of the supreme court [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=520.9799999999999s)]
*  Trump has tried to wipe his crimes [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=524.7399999999999s)]
*  Against the country from voters minds and on the debate stage two days ago [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=526.9799999999999s)]
*  He's running mate jd vance refused to tell tens of millions americans if he would help donald trump do it again [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=530.66s)]
*  Just in the last 24 hours [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=536.66s)]
*  We got new evidence from special prosecutor jack smith about how far trump was willing to go to foment the coup on january 6th [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=538.02s)]
*  and tonight [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=544.9s)]
*  The birthplace of the republican party liz cheney stood up to remind us that he is really going to try to do it again [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=546.26s)]
*  But if we come together as a pro-democracy coalition we can stop it [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=552.1s)]
*  We have a shared commitment [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=557.54s)]
*  a shared commitment as americans to ensuring that future generations [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=559.86s)]
*  Live in a nation where power is transferred peacefully [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=565.32s)]
*  Where our leaders are men and women of good faith? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY35v2KHBY&t=569.5600000000001s)]
