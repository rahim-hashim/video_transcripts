# Gamers accuse Elon Musk of cheating, Musk throws a tantrum
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE)
*  How many genders are there? Tough one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, there are two genders. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=2.0s)]
*  I know that well. I'm a sheehee, so I'm on board. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=5.0s)]
*  How many push-ups can you do? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=8.0s)]
*  I did five sets of 47 this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=11.0s)]
*  That was a Senate confirmation hearing for the prospective Secretary of Defense, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=14.0s)]
*  a man facing all sorts of accusations and allegations of incompetence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=18.0s)]
*  The Montana Republican Senator, Tim Sheehee, was asking Pete Hegseth vitally important questions, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=23.0s)]
*  like how many genders there are and how many push-ups can you do? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=29.0s)]
*  Hegseth said he did a total of 235 push-ups yesterday morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=32.0s)]
*  We know that he loves being seen doing push-ups, I will say, as you can see in the 2018 on-air contest with the Fox News colleague. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=37.0s)]
*  Clearly, he's a guy who spends some time in the gym. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=45.0s)]
*  But of course, Hegseth also specifically told the Senate he did sets of 47 push-ups, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=47.0s)]
*  and I'll be honest, I was like, that's a weird number for a set. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=51.0s)]
*  But presumably, right, as a tribute to Donald Trump, who is about to become the 47th president, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=55.0s)]
*  Hegseth is doing 47 push-ups in the quiet of his hotel room. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=60.0s)]
*  That's par for the course, I've got to say, with this downright weird version of masculinity [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=65.0s)]
*  that MAGA and its boosters are pushing on Americans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=71.0s)]
*  You can see it in what people have been calling the vibe shift, right, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=75.0s)]
*  this odd-to-be-off-putting thing happening where cultural figures and business titans [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=77.0s)]
*  are embracing Trump out of all proportion to his 1.5% victory margin, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=82.0s)]
*  one of the narrowest wins in American electoral history. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=88.0s)]
*  A huge part of this has been this pathological expression of gender frustration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=91.0s)]
*  by all kinds of men who seem to think that the real way to be a man is to insult people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=97.0s)]
*  and endlessly whine about DEI and the unfairness of the world to rich dudes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=104.0s)]
*  Of course, in the center of it all, right, the one it begins with is the man himself, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=109.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, who is fundamentally more almost than he is anything else a crybaby. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=113.0s)]
*  He's a crybaby, endlessly, endlessly complaining in ever more dramatic language [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=119.0s)]
*  about how much of a victim he is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=123.0s)]
*  Trump and his campaign expressly courted the bro vote, if you will, in November. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=126.0s)]
*  They gave speaking slots at the Republican National Convention to men like Hulk Hogan, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=131.0s)]
*  UFC owner Dana White, who both embody a kind of cartoonish vision of masculinity [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=134.0s)]
*  that's particularly appealing to adolescent boys. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=140.0s)]
*  That's where a lot of them make their money. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=143.0s)]
*  White, who was once caught on tape slapping his wife after she slapped him, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=146.0s)]
*  has also become fast friends with Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=150.0s)]
*  Just last week, Zuckerberg put White on the board of directors of Metta, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=154.0s)]
*  Facebook's parent company. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=158.0s)]
*  That was the same time that Zuckerberg announced Metta was ending its fact-checking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=160.0s)]
*  and moderation, in part, he said, because it was offending the fragile sensibilities of men. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=163.0s)]
*  I do think a lot of our society has become very, like, I don't know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=168.0s)]
*  I don't even know the right word for it, but it's kind of like neutered or emasculated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=176.0s)]
*  I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=181.0s)]
*  And I didn't really feel that until I got involved in martial arts, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=189.0s)]
*  which I think is still a much more masculine culture. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=196.0s)]
*  I think having a culture that, like, celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=201.0s)]
*  I mean, look, martial arts, jiu-jitsu in particular, are great, but all that other stuff is that's your stuff, bro. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=209.0s)]
*  According to reporting by the New York Times, Zuckerberg also met late last year with Trump aide Stephen Miller [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=216.0s)]
*  and signaled to the Trump team that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda of fighting DEI, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=221.0s)]
*  according to three people with knowledge of the meeting, and get this, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=226.0s)]
*  Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=229.0s)]
*  for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees' self-expression in the workplace. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=233.0s)]
*  I mean, I have to say, at one level, right, it actually is a perfect example of masculine energy [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=238.0s)]
*  to not own your own decision and instead blame them on a woman who is your subordinate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=243.0s)]
*  A lot of men do that a lot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=248.0s)]
*  But it's a kind of masculine energy, if you want to call it that, that's pretty damn pathetic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=250.0s)]
*  Which is the other weird thing about all these manly men and how they are performing masculinally. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=256.0s)]
*  Not only does it involve a ton of whining, I mean, like, constant whining and blame shifting, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=262.0s)]
*  it also involves abject levels of, dare I say, emasculating subservience. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=268.0s)]
*  All these manly men so eager to submit to the awesome will of Donald Trump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=276.0s)]
*  while simultaneously bragging about their superhuman feats, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=283.0s)]
*  whether it's all the push-ups you can allegedly do in Hex's case [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=286.0s)]
*  or claiming you are one of the best video gamers in the universe, as Elon Musk has recently done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=289.0s)]
*  So are you in the top 20 in the world? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=297.0s)]
*  Wow, in Diablo. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=300.0s)]
*  Do you want to tell everybody your handle? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=301.0s)]
*  No, don't tell them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=303.0s)]
*  Don't tell them, it's not worth it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=304.0s)]
*  It's a bold claim, which Musk has made again recently with another game, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=306.0s)]
*  and hardcore gamers quickly took him apart after watching a livestream of Musk playing that game [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=310.0s)]
*  in which he committed tons of mistakes that no top-flight gamer would make. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=315.0s)]
*  Many suggested Musk had hired a ringer to play the game for him or cheated in some other way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=318.0s)]
*  Now, Musk's response to the barrage of criticism was to, well, throw a tantrum, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=323.0s)]
*  to post criticism of one of these gamers who roasted him, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=327.0s)]
*  take away that gamer's blue check verification on X, a social media site Musk owns. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=330.0s)]
*  Remember when Musk bought Twitter and said it was totally unfair [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=337.0s)]
*  how they were using blue checks to separate users into lords and peasants? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=340.0s)]
*  Now the tech titan who complains about the woke mind virus, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=344.0s)]
*  said his trans daughter is dead to him, is showing just how thin-skinned he really is. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=347.0s)]
*  I mean, we right now are under the thumb of just desperately thin-skinned thirsty weirdos [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=353.0s)]
*  who are convinced, as New York Times columnist Jamelle Bowie put it, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=362.0s)]
*  that masculine energy means license to act like a chud in public [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=366.0s)]
*  as opposed to more traditional notions of public masculinity, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=370.0s)]
*  such as those that put a premium on the performance of integrity, honesty, honor, and generosity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=374.0s)]
*  I read that today and I was thinking about my grandfather, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=379.0s)]
*  who is a lifelong conservative Republican, stridently anti-communist, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=382.0s)]
*  very religious Catholic man, very anti-abortion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=387.0s)]
*  And I loved him. I loved my grandfather. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=390.0s)]
*  And my god, he and I had very different politics and worldviews, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=392.0s)]
*  certainly around gender, though we never really talked about it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=395.0s)]
*  But I will say this from my grandfather, the bear, as we called him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=398.0s)]
*  There were two character traits he had that I really admired among many, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=402.0s)]
*  but two I really admired. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=406.0s)]
*  He was his own man through and through. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=408.0s)]
*  My grandfather did not bow and he did not scrape and he didn't whine. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=411.0s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=416.0s)]
*  He did not whine and he had no tolerance for those who did. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=417.0s)]
*  If all these psychologically damaged, very powerful men [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=421.0s)]
*  are going to fetishize some throwback conception of manhood, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=425.0s)]
*  maybe start with that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=429.0s)]
*  Be your own man. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=431.0s)]
*  Don't debase yourself by bending the knee. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlrAUIiHUE&t=433.0s)]
