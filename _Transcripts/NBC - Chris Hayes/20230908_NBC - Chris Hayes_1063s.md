# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. One of the men behind Donald Trump's attempted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=0.0s)]
*  coup is facing justice tonight. Serious repercussions. Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=4.08s)]
*  has been found guilty on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress by a jury of his peers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=11.16s)]
*  Navarro was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee back in February of last year, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=17.28s)]
*  like hundreds of others. Committee investigators were seeking testimony and documents related [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=21.8s)]
*  to his involvement in Trump's attempted coup, specifically charges that Navarro, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=26.08s)]
*  reportedly worked with Steve Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=31.24s)]
*  certification of and ultimately change the outcome of the 2020 election. And just to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=37.0s)]
*  be clear here, it's not like Navarro was hiding his involvement in the coup. He self-published [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  this document full of bogus claims of election fraud that he called the Navarro Report in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=48.16s)]
*  case anyone wanted to know who wrote it. He wrote about the coup in his book, including [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=53.24s)]
*  his signature political strategy to overturn the election, which he called the Green Bay [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Sweep, reference to an old football play. Navarro went on the record with the Daily [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=62.34s)]
*  Beast to talk about his role in the coup. And he appeared on this very network multiple [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=66.58s)]
*  times to discuss the coup with Ari Melber. We had over 100 congressmen and senators on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=72.0s)]
*  Capitol ready to implement the sweep. The sweep was simply that. We were going to challenge [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=80.84s)]
*  the results of the election in the six battleground states. The votes were sent back to those [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=87.44s)]
*  battleground states and looked at again that there would be enough concern amongst the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=94.04s)]
*  legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=99.98s)]
*  Do you realize you are describing a coup? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  No, I totally reject many of your premises there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=110.4s)]
*  Ari, it's like a naked bootleg, but for ending the American experiment. So it's not like [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=114.76s)]
*  Peter Navarro wasn't willing to talk about the coup. He just wouldn't talk about it with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=120.0s)]
*  one group of people, the January 6th committee, even though, as former committee chair Liz [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=124.52s)]
*  Cheney pointed out, plenty of other Trump allies defied their work while still complying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=128.48s)]
*  with a lawful subpoena. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=134.84s)]
*  Roger Stone took the fifth. General Michael Flynn took the fifth. John Eastman took the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=136.08s)]
*  fifth. Others like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro simply refused to comply with lawful [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=142.28s)]
*  subpoenas and they have been indicted. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Steve Bannon was also convicted of contempt of Congress last year for doing the same thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I really, I can't help but ask, is this one of the stupidest, most pointless crimes ever [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  committed by anyone? Even if Navarro wanted to obstruct the investigation, he could have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  just hired a lawyer for the week, pleaded the fifth to every question, he'd be well [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=165.52s)]
*  within his constitutional rights to do so, others did it, and now he wouldn't be facing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=169.36s)]
*  prison time. Because even as Navarro pledges to appeal, this was obviously such an open [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=173.4s)]
*  and shut case. The trial only lasted about two days. The jury only deliberated for a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=179.24s)]
*  few hours, probably a few hours too long, actually. And when NBC asked Navarro's lawyer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=184.0s)]
*  why he did not call any witnesses to defend his client, he replied, and I quote him here, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=189.68s)]
*  what defense do I have? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=194.56s)]
*  This afternoon, Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis published a letter responding [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=198.96s)]
*  to Republican Congressman Jim Jordan. He's now in the majority. He's now the chair of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=203.68s)]
*  the Republican so-called weaponization committee, who has tried on multiple occasions now to run [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=207.84s)]
*  cover for Donald Trump by obstructing Willis's investigation. Willis writes, quote, Chairman [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=213.28s)]
*  Jordan, I tell people often, deal with reality or reality that will deal with you. Face this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=220.0s)]
*  reality, Chairman Jordan. The select group of defendants who you fret over in my jurisdiction [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=225.52s)]
*  are like every other defendant entitled to no worse or better treatment than any other American [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=230.56s)]
*  citizen. For a more thorough understanding of Georgia's RICO statute, its application [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=235.28s)]
*  and similar laws in other states, I encourage you to read RICO State by State. As a non-member [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=240.24s)]
*  of the bar, you can purchase a copy for $249. In addition to that letter to Jordan, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=245.68s)]
*  D.A. Willis is taking new steps today to protect jurors from potentially violent Trump supporters. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  As we've covered on this program before, the trial or trials of Trump and his 18 co-defendants in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=259.36s)]
*  Atlanta will be televised and not because it's a Trump trial. That's what happens in Georgia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=263.6s)]
*  And that to my mind is a good thing. I mean, especially as voters consider whether or not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=269.52s)]
*  the four times indicted ex-president should be sent back to the White House to finish the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=273.44s)]
*  job he started on January 6th. That said, D.A. Willis is understandably concerned about the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=276.8s)]
*  safety of those jurors sitting in that jury box that you see there over the attorney's right [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=282.08s)]
*  shoulder, those jurors who will determine the fate of the ex-president and his confederates. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=286.48s)]
*  Today in a legal motion, she asked Judge Scott McAfee to bar the press from publishing any [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=291.68s)]
*  information about prospective jurors, including images, video, or court sketches. It's not an [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=297.04s)]
*  abstract concern. As D.A. Willis notes in the motion, personal information about the grand [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=302.72s)]
*  jurors who voted to indict Trump was shared online with the obvious intention to encourage [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  harassment. Willis herself has been doxxed, received racist death threats as a result, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=312.16s)]
*  and we know Donald Trump cultivates intimidation and menace as a routine part of his political [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  agenda as a tool he wields. In fact, part of the Georgia-Rico indictment deals specifically [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=322.24s)]
*  with the harassment of two specific election workers who had angry Trump supporters [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=329.6s)]
*  showing up outside their home because their address got put on the internet. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=334.56s)]
*  We may learn even more about that harassment tomorrow. That's when the special grand jury [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  report outlining Trump and his co-defendants alleged crimes is made public at 10 a.m. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=343.6s)]
*  That's not all we got out of Georgia today. Trump's lawyers say they may request to move [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=349.12s)]
*  his trial to federal court. And then speaking of federal court, after a month-long break, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  this was surprising to me when I saw this today, and I still don't know quite what's up with it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=358.72s)]
*  We're going to try to find out. But Jack Smith's federal grand jury, the one that's looking into [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=362.8s)]
*  the attempted coup, the one that indicted Donald Trump a few months ago, met again today to continue [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=367.6s)]
*  its investigation. There is no indication things are slowing down anytime soon. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=373.36s)]
*  Medorski-Cordell served 19 years as a judge, including over a dozen on the Superior Court [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=379.68s)]
*  of California. She's author of Her Honor, My Life on the Bench. Harry Lippman served as deputy [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=384.72s)]
*  assistant attorney general of the U.S. Department of Justice. He's now a legal affairs columnist [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  for the Los Angeles Times. And both join me now. Judge Cordell, let me start with you on this juror [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=393.6s)]
*  question. I read what District Attorney Willis had to say. It seems eminently reasonable. I wonder [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  how much is this standard practice in a high-profile case? How much is this a sort of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=404.72s)]
*  extra-prophylactic measure, given the context of what we've seen before, and particularly [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=409.36s)]
*  Trump supporters? Well, Chris, the first anonymous jury in this country was impaneled in 1977 [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=412.96s)]
*  in New York City. It was a trial of Leroy Barnes, and he was a drug kingpin. And it was an anonymous [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  jury because his network was such that they were concerned about jury tampering, intimidation, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  violence. This man was charged with all manner of drug crimes, as well as a number of murders. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=436.4s)]
*  So that's where we had an anonymous jury. That's where it started. And it became very common in the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  1990s. A more recent high-profile case was the case of George Zimmerman, who was charged with the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=450.96s)]
*  murder of Trayvon Martin. That was an anonymous jury, again, because of concerns. There were [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  protests going on. So to have an anonymous jury in the case in Fulton County, it's not only [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  appropriate, it should be required. We know that. We know what's going to happen. What's going to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=472.56s)]
*  happen is what happened to the grand jurors whose personal information got out. So we already know [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=479.04s)]
*  what's going to happen. I think the judge is required to do it. And I do want to note that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=484.48s)]
*  in the Trayvon Martin trial, the trial of George Zimmerman, the jury was actually sequestered during [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=488.32s)]
*  deliberations. And I think it's highly likely that that's going to happen in the case in Fulton County. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=495.36s)]
*  Yeah, that seems eminently sensible to me as well. I want to ask about the noises coming from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=501.44s)]
*  Trump's attorneys, Harry, about this venue or not venue change, but it would be moving this case into [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=510.48s)]
*  federal court. And here's what I want to ask you. So they're saying they might do it. It seems to [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=515.36s)]
*  me, and again, the procedure here is complex and opaque, and I don't know it. It seems to me that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=520.24s)]
*  what's in their interest is to burn as many days as possible and wait until the last minute to file [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=526.4s)]
*  that so you can push out the deadline of that and everything has to go on and on. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=530.32s)]
*  Is there some drop dead date that they have to say whether they're going to do that or not? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=534.0s)]
*  Or can they just burn up time until they're forced to? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=538.96s)]
*  There's a drop dead date. It's 30 days after he's been arraigned, which was August 31st. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's September 30th. And I think we've always known he was going to go to the very end. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  Just as you say, any any hour of a delay is a good hour for Trump. So it's a foregone conclusion. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=552.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, we said this up front. He would do it. He would do it at the end of 30 days. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=561.2s)]
*  His prospects are very, very poor. It's of a piece with what's going on with Mark Meadows, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=565.2s)]
*  what happened with Trump previously about trying to show executive privilege. That is, is he in the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=571.76s)]
*  conduct alleged acting within the scope of his official duties as president? And you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  fomenting a coup is nowhere in Article two. I think they will make quick work of it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=585.68s)]
*  He'll be able that these motions provide for automatic right of appeal. So it'll go up to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=590.88s)]
*  the 11th Circuit. But we have to hope that they'll make quick work of it. But remember, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=596.2399999999999s)]
*  Judge McAfee talked about that even at the hearing as perhaps a matter of months. So that's something [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  he's been planning on burning from the start, starting with this first 30 days. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I got to say, again, from my perspective, you know, Meadows even has a more [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=611.84s)]
*  plausible claim to me. If he's saying I was, I was subordinate, I'm the chief of staff, I do this, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  then the guy who was actually engineering the whole thing, who obviously can almost by definition [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  be acting as an official capacity to undo an American election. 100%. Meadows is the only guy [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=625.44s)]
*  who has, I think, a colorable claim. The other three who've tried it, Georgia electors, Willis [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=633.2s)]
*  said sort of very puckishly, they were just masquerading. Anyway, there's no federal role [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=639.2s)]
*  they have when they're showing a fake marshals badge. And so I think it's Meadows and Meadows [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  only. And then the question of who goes over with him, that's an unsettled question in Georgia law. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But I think, I think Trump is DOA, but of course he'll do it and play out the appeal, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  probably petition for cert even. But this is, this is a claim that I think goes nowhere. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  As of today, all the Proud Boy leaders charged in the wake of the insurrection have been found [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=667.04s)]
*  guilty by a jury of their peers and sentence. The five men will spend the next decade or two in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  prison from Enrique Tarrio's record 22 years to Dominic Pizola's 10 years. Now we're learning that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  the men were offered plea deals by the Justice Department that would have drastically reduced [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=684.56s)]
*  their prison time. According to a filing by an attorney for the two of the men, the offer would [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  have cut their collective time by more than half. They all declined and went to trial and will spend [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=694.0s)]
*  a combined 82 years in prison, adding to the cumulative 700 years in January six sentences so [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=698.8s)]
*  far. So now the leadership of the Proud Boys behind bars for 10 to 20 years, I guess it's [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=705.36s)]
*  worth asking what comes next for a group, what it means for our imperiled democratic order. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=710.8s)]
*  Andy Campbell is a senior editor reporter at HuffPost, the author of We Are the Proud Boys, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=716.16s)]
*  how a right-wing street gang ushered in a new era of American extremism, and he joins me now. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=720.8s)]
*  Andy, I've read your reporting on the Proud Boys, covered them enough over the years, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  and they've always straddled this line between kind of preposterous cosplay and actual kind of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=732.0s)]
*  menace. And the culmination, I think, of their actions was January 6 where they ended up in that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  latter category. How do you understand the group and how do you understand what they did on January [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=744.64s)]
*  6 in relation to that history? Right. Well, they project themselves to the public as a drinking [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=750.16s)]
*  club who sort of accidentally fell into self-defense on January 6 and during a bunch of events on the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=758.64s)]
*  parade of violence they've been going on seven, eight years now. But the Proud Boys, while they [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=766.16s)]
*  are very drunk, while they are doing drugs out there, while they are partying, their directive [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=772.4s)]
*  and the thing that they work toward is committing acts of political violence for Republican causes. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=778.16s)]
*  And for their inception, Trump was their director. Trump was the one pointing out the grievances that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  they would fight for, and at the end, it was Trump. We were just told that they were about to take [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=791.92s)]
*  plea deals or that they didn't take plea deals. It turns out Enrique Tarrio gave an interview today [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=800.0s)]
*  with the Gateway Pundit in which he said outrageously that he didn't take a plea deal [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=805.6s)]
*  because the federal government wanted him to lie about Trump. And it just shows how much they [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=809.92s)]
*  believe Trump is their guy despite getting zero love from the guy throughout their entire existence. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=815.68s)]
*  So you've got the, you know, these guys are all going to do serious time. Tarrio got 22 years [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=822.72s)]
*  the head of that organization. I didn't realize he's giving an interview to Gateway Pundit, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=827.12s)]
*  which shows that like none of them seem to actually be remorseful or actually filled with regret. It [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=829.92s)]
*  seems like they're committed to this. We should also see there's a long context if you read, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=834.64s)]
*  you know, 20th century European history of like right-wing parties having like street fighting [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=839.1199999999999s)]
*  thugs that beat people up and commit political violence on behalf of far-right parties. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=844.0s)]
*  What does this mean for them now? Well, let's get it straight. The Proud Boys [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=849.04s)]
*  didn't go away after January 6. They're not going away now. I mean, despite their leaders sitting [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=855.3599999999999s)]
*  behind bars, the Proud Boys have been fighting the GOP's grievances in the street. That grievance [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=861.6s)]
*  lately has been LGBTQ issues, trans healthcare and drag queen story hours among them. So they've [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=866.96s)]
*  been out across the country going more local and attacking and harassing people at drag queen story [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=873.28s)]
*  hours, children's hospitals, public libraries, places where these things are discussed. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  The only change that happened since these sentences and since January 6 is that they aren't [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=884.64s)]
*  amassing for Donald Trump because it's worrisome. They're worried about federal infiltration. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=890.32s)]
*  They're worried about consequences. But they were directed by Enrique Tarrio to go local, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=895.2s)]
*  to run for office, to sidle up next to politicians in their locales and do things that way. And [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=901.12s)]
*  they've done that very successfully under the public eye since January 6. So their extremism [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=907.36s)]
*  continues. And I argue that if the Proud Boys dissolve tomorrow or change their name, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=915.28s)]
*  which I don't expect to happen, the political violence that they helped normalize for this [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=920.24s)]
*  era of the GOP is still so ingrained that that is sticking around. The extremism is still out there. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  It's still being put into policy. So we're not seeing the Proud Boys going away anytime soon. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that point about, again, in 20th century European politics, particularly in other [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=936.56s)]
*  places in the world, it has been a not uncommon thing for parties, movements, and factions, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=942.48s)]
*  particularly on the extreme right, to have a street fighting force, a violent force, sometimes [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=947.84s)]
*  those that are outright armed and murderous. They have introduced a kind of form of those [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=952.24s)]
*  politics which hadn't really been quite there in American politics in a while. Obviously, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=957.28s)]
*  this is what various groups like the KKK were back in the 1920s. They were an armed part, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=961.44s)]
*  a violent part of a political faction. You also, about this, about the sort of local leaders, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=966.64s)]
*  the Proud Boys, they've made inroads with GOPs since January 6. Members have been running for [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=972.72s)]
*  minor elected offices across the country. Several have secured seats alongside the GOP elite. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=977.36s)]
*  A Proud Boy in Sarasota County, Florida, for example, was elected last year to the County [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=982.08s)]
*  Republican Executive Committee, where he has the power to influence local politics alongside fellow [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=985.84s)]
*  committee member Mike Flynn, Trump's one-time national security advisor. We've got news today [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=990.48s)]
*  that both Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy have said that their sentences are too long [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=995.12s)]
*  and asked about considering pardons and definitely not ruling it out. What do you think that does? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1000.56s)]
*  What's the effect of that kind of language from non-Trump Republican leaders? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1004.64s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, it shows that the Proud Boys and the violence that they've committed [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1010.16s)]
*  is still fully embraced by the GOP. This political violence isn't going away until the GOP calls its [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  neo-fascist foot soldiers out of the street, right, and until they believe in elections. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  The next election is going to be under threat until the Republicans pull that out. And so, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1027.76s)]
*  to have DeSantis saying that, the Proud Boys certainly believe them and will throw their [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1033.36s)]
*  support behind them for it. Andy Campbell, who wrote a really good book about this. Thank you very much. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1037.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vObgB54hgHU&t=1057.04s)]
