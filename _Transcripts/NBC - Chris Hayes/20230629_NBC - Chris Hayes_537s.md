Video Description: Chris Hayes on Clarence Thomas voting to strike down affirmative action: "One of the things we saw today was a brilliant man—who was able to overcome centuries of institutionalized prejudice, who was able to come from the most unlikely of backgrounds with the help of a system designed to accomplish just that—turn around and pull the ladder up behind him."

# How Clarence Thomas ‘pulled the ladder up behind him’ on affirmative action
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today in a landmark ruling that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=0.0s)]
*  overturns decades of president sweeps aside generations of arguments about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=4.14s)]
*  racial justice and inequality, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision, six [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=8.22s)]
*  conservatives to the three liberals, effectively got rid of the use of race [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  in college admissions at all, even for the purposes of increasing diversity. In [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=17.92s)]
*  the wake of the decisions, many colleges and universities immediately sent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=22.44s)]
*  alumni outlining how they're going to operate going forward. One such school [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=27.0s)]
*  was the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, which is notable because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=32.28s)]
*  that is the alma mater of Justice Clarence Thomas, whose decades-long [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=37.04s)]
*  project to destroy affirmative action culminated in her victory today. Now [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=40.64s)]
*  Thomas did not write the court's majority opinion that was written by [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=45.28s)]
*  Justice Roberts, but he did write a fiery 58-page concurrence denouncing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=47.96s)]
*  race as a factor in admissions as policies that, and I quote him here, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  fly in the face of our colorblind constitution and our nation's equality [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  ideal. Clarence Thomas did not always think this way. In the late 1960s, when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=61.32s)]
*  he was at Holy Cross, he was one of just a few dozen black students at that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=67.32s)]
*  college. As Joel Anderson writes for Slate, quote, he got admitted thanks to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=70.88s)]
*  his good grades and a recommendation from a nun, and maybe in part because [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=74.96s)]
*  the school was actively looking for black students. It was the 1960s. It was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=77.6s)]
*  in the wake of the Watts riots. The school had not had many black students, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=82.48s)]
*  and it went out looking for some. And once he got to Holy Cross, well, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=85.76s)]
*  Thomas's politics there were downright radical. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=89.56s)]
*  He definitely was inspired by the Black Panthers. He dressed like them. He [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  talked like them. He had a beret, had army fatigues, and he had the army [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=98.16s)]
*  boots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=104.04s)]
*  He wore afro. He was out there with everyone else. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=106.68s)]
*  After completing his undergraduate degree, Thomas was accepted at a number [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=111.32s)]
*  of prestigious law schools, including Harvard, but he chose to attend Yale [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=114.32s)]
*  Law because he believed the campus's liberal politics best aligned with his [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  own. Well, there, however, Thomas became disillusioned with his own status at [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  that elite university. As New York Times reported back in 1991, Thomas was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  accepted to Yale as part of the school's explicit affirmative action plan to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  admit more students of color. But he resented any suggestion that he received [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=133.6s)]
*  any special consideration because of his race. And once he graduated from Yale [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=138.16s)]
*  Law, Thomas blamed his initial inability to find work in the legal profession, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  not on the fact that many legal institutions and law firms in the 1970s [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=147.84s)]
*  were still redoubts of racism and white supremacy and had racist hiring [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=153.36s)]
*  practices and did not want to hire him, but rather on the belief that his degree [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=157.72s)]
*  had been tainted by the implication of affirmative action. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=163.56s)]
*  He had his Yale Law degree and he had a 10 cent stamp stuck to it. You know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  like a 10 cent price tag stuck to it. Because he's like, yeah, this is what [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=173.52s)]
*  it's worth, right? 10 cents, right? No more. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=177.44s)]
*  He came to blame affirmative action for the rejection he felt. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=183.04s)]
*  Now I knew what a law degree from Yale was worth when it bore the taint of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=189.8s)]
*  racial preference. I was humiliated and desperate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=194.12s)]
*  Eventually, Thomas found a job in the office of the conservative Missouri [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=198.6s)]
*  Attorney General John Danforth, who recently told the Slow Burn podcast that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=201.76s)]
*  he hired Thomas in part because of his race. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  My ambition was that the AG's office was to be the best law office in the state. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=209.96s)]
*  Now, did I also think that it was important to have a diverse office? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=216.56s)]
*  Yes, I did. And did I think that it would be wonderful to hire Clarence Thomas [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=220.84s)]
*  for that reason? Yes. But the most important reason was I had to get the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=225.96s)]
*  job done. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=231.52s)]
*  From there, Thomas Starr continued to rise in conservative legal circles, a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=233.0s)]
*  rise that, according to his ex-girlfriend, was again predicated in part on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  affirmative action. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=241.0s)]
*  In 1982, the White House offered Thomas a big promotion, the chance to run his [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  own federal agency. The trouble was that agency was the Equal Employment [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Opportunity Commission. This was exactly the kind of role Clarence Thomas didn't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=252.92s)]
*  want, a position focused on race and discrimination. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=257.32s)]
*  He didn't want to be there. He was resentful that he had not been offered [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=261.12s)]
*  something that a white person would want. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=265.68s)]
*  Thomas was in a bind. He wanted to keep rising in the administration, but he [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  didn't want to rise this way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=273.92s)]
*  He didn't want anyone to think that he had gotten a job because he was black. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=276.24s)]
*  Of course, every job he had ever gotten was because he was black. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=283.0s)]
*  Now, I want to be absolutely clear here. No one is saying that Clarence Thomas [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  was unqualified for any of the long list of jobs. Even his critics, his harshest [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=292.84s)]
*  critics of his jurisprudence, will concede, can concede that he is undoubtedly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  one of the most, if not the most, important and influential legal minds of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  his generation. But that mistaken belief that race-based consideration, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=307.0s)]
*  diversity-based consideration, and some elusive concept of true merit abstracted [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  from that are mutually exclusive is the foundational lie on which today's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=318.16s)]
*  Supreme Court decision was built. It was that belief, however, that helped [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=322.72s)]
*  secure Thomas's legal legacy. Thomas was eventually appointed to the D.C. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=327.0s)]
*  Court of Appeals by President George H.W. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=331.68s)]
*  Bush, and just two years later, Bush nominated him to the Supreme Court to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  replace the retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, at that point the only black [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=337.92s)]
*  person to ever sit on the nation's highest court. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=342.44s)]
*  The president called Thomas the best qualified person for the job and denied [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=346.52s)]
*  that he selected Thomas to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall because he's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=350.8s)]
*  black. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=355.04s)]
*  And the fact he's minority, so much the better, but that is not the factor. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=356.12s)]
*  And I would strongly resent any charge that might be forthcoming on quotas when [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=360.32s)]
*  it relates to appointing the best man to the court. Again, same thing here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=366.52s)]
*  Thomas was both qualified for the position on the court, as were probably [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=370.76s)]
*  several dozen folks, maybe more. He was also nominated due to the obvious [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=374.64s)]
*  political motivations in replacing the nation's first black Justice Thurgood [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=381.12s)]
*  Marshall. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=384.56s)]
*  During his confirmation hearings, Thomas was asked about his own vocal [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=386.2s)]
*  opposition to affirmative action. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=389.68s)]
*  The question is directly in the entry to Yale. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=392.56s)]
*  Were you part of an affirmative action quota? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=396.28s)]
*  Were you part of a racial quota in terms of entering that law school? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=399.0s)]
*  Senator, I have not during my adult life or during my academic career been a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=403.12s)]
*  part of any quota. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=409.24s)]
*  The effort on the part of Yale during my years there was to reach out and open [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=411.4s)]
*  its doors to minorities whom it felt were qualified. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=418.84s)]
*  And I took them at their word on that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  And I have advocated that very kind of affirmative action. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  Just think about that moment for a second, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=434.64s)]
*  Now, having seen some of this man's trajectory in his bio, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  The thing he hates more than anything that wounds his pride, that enrages him, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  is to be viewed as being less than or not qualified as being an affirmative [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  action case. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=449.0s)]
*  And yet at every key juncture in his life, he is asked about it over and over [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=449.56s)]
*  again. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=454.16s)]
*  And for Thomas and the conservative majority in the court, it all boils down [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=455.92s)]
*  again to this nebulous concept of merit, of qualified, who is deserving of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=460.12s)]
*  opportunities and who's not. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=465.36s)]
*  But I think that misses the point. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=467.92s)]
*  It's really a question about what kinds of institutions and really what kind of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=469.0s)]
*  society we want to have. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=472.24s)]
*  Do we want a society in which people like Clarence Thomas from the small town [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=474.24s)]
*  of Pinpoint, Georgia, just several generations removed from slavery and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=478.48s)]
*  Jim Crow, are selected, nurtured and encouraged, or ones in which they don't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=483.36s)]
*  go to Holy Cross and they don't go to Yale and they don't end up in the courts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=489.04s)]
*  And instead, those schools and those institutions pick more sailing team [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=491.76s)]
*  members and legacies. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=494.92s)]
*  One of the things we saw today, and we saw a lot when we talked about it, was a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=498.12s)]
*  brilliant man who was able to overcome centuries of institutionalized prejudice, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=500.96s)]
*  who was able to come from the most unlikely of backgrounds. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=504.88s)]
*  With the help of a system designed to accomplish just that, turn around and pull [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=510.88s)]
*  the ladder up behind. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGbP6hJxV8&t=516.0799999999999s)]
