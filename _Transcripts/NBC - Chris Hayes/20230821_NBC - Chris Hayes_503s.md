# Trump says he will surrender Thursday on Georgia charges
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A)
*  So, this is surrender week for Donald Trump, as well as the 18 others charged with racketeering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=0.0s)]
*  in Georgia for plotting to steal the 2020 election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=5.78s)]
*  They'll have just over three and a half days until noon on Friday to surrender at the Fulton [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=9.8s)]
*  County Jail to avoid facing arrest. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=13.6s)]
*  We just learned that the ex-president says he will surrender in Atlanta on Thursday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=16.32s)]
*  Today his lawyers were at the Fulton County Courthouse where his bond was set at $200,000. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=20.32s)]
*  Let's just sit with that for a second. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  By the end of this week, the ex-president of the United States will be out on bond in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=26.82s)]
*  yet another jurisdiction. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=30.9s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis is also trying to stop Trump from continuing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=33.18s)]
*  his practice of making direct or indirect threats, or both, against people involved [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=36.54s)]
*  in his various criminal cases. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=41.14s)]
*  She ordered him to, quote, perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=42.96s)]
*  to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=48.54s)]
*  of justice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=52.6s)]
*  That includes no threat of any nature against any co-defendant, against any witness, against [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=53.84s)]
*  any victim, or against the community. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=59.38s)]
*  And it makes clear that this applies to, quote, posts on social media or reposts of posts [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=61.92s)]
*  or retweets, if you want to call them that, made by another individual. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=67.16s)]
*  Some of Trump's 18 co-defendants also got bond orders today as well, but Trump is so [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=71.04s)]
*  far the only one with these detailed orders against making threats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=75.18s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=78.36s)]
*  All of this comes while the ex-president and his legal team are navigating three other [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=79.64s)]
*  indictments and the possibility that some of his co-defendants in Georgia may have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=83.6s)]
*  a big incentive, a huge incentive to cooperate against him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=88.08s)]
*  For one thing, Trump can never pardon any of them, even if he returns to the White House, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=91.8s)]
*  because this is a state case. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=95.72s)]
*  And of course, all of this is just a fraction of his current legal problems. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=97.36s)]
*  Glenn Kirchner is a former federal prosecutor and host of the podcast Justice Matters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=101.72s)]
*  Ankush Cardori is a former federal prosecutor and a contributing writer for New York Magazine. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  And both join me now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=110.36s)]
*  So Glenn, I just wanted to start with these kind of warnings from the judge, because that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=112.04s)]
*  is very strong language. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=115.84s)]
*  We've heard it in some of these other cases. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  But what can she actually do and what do you think she should do if he violates it? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=119.84s)]
*  You know, I don't think Fonny Willis owns a pair of kid gloves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  So I have a feeling if Donald Trump violates these conditions, and how could he not, Jen, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=128.08s)]
*  right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  He can't post or repost anything that might be intimidating of a witness. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Not just a week ago, he did something that if he did it now, it would be prohibited by [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=139.96s)]
*  this order. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=145.6s)]
*  He said, look, I know that former Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan is about to testify before [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=147.34s)]
*  the grand jury, quote, he shouldn't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  He's already violated it, essentially. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  He would have. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=157.68s)]
*  He would have. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=158.68s)]
*  And interestingly, that actually constitutes a violation of Georgia state law. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=159.68s)]
*  And that could be used next week by Judge Chutkin up the street to say you did violate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=164.72s)]
*  a condition that had been set for you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=170.24s)]
*  And we were just talking before we, during the break, I guess, about what the actual [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=172.72s)]
*  conditions are, what are the consequences if your name is not Donald Trump, which is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  important to remember as we discuss equal justice under law. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=180.2s)]
*  So if somebody else did this, what would happen to them? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=183.16s)]
*  Well, actually, we have a pretty good example that has been in the news recently. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=186.0s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried was charged for a massive fraud. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=190.24s)]
*  He was out on bail. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=192.56s)]
*  And prosecutors allege and the judge agreed that it appeared that he was attempting witness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=194.68s)]
*  intimidation by kind of working through the press to cede some negative information about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  a cooperator. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=203.0s)]
*  He was remanded. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=204.0s)]
*  That means he was sent to jail. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=205.0s)]
*  And the judge was not happy about it, obviously. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=207.04s)]
*  But that's what often happens to defendants who are out on bond. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Honestly, in the ordinary course, it can be quite easy to violate terms of release, almost [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  like a tripwire. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=219.84s)]
*  And Trump is sort of getting sort of a lot of benefit of the doubt. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=221.4s)]
*  You also had something you wrote interestingly recently, that the addition of defendants [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=226.28s)]
*  creates pressure and incentives for those people to cooperate against the biggest target, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=230.24s)]
*  which in this case is clearly Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=234.32s)]
*  I referenced, of course, in Georgia, he can't pardon them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=236.56s)]
*  What are the other incentives? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=240.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's the traditional set of incentives, and this applies at the federal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=241.0s)]
*  and the state level. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=244.4s)]
*  Anytime you have a large multi-defendant case and there's a lead defendant, right, and Trump [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=245.88s)]
*  is undoubtedly the lead defendant here, right, there is an incentive for everyone else who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=250.0s)]
*  might have information on him to try to cooperate against that person to cut themselves a break [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=254.24s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=258.68s)]
*  It's purely self-interest. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=259.68s)]
*  It's not an act of altruism, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=260.68s)]
*  They've been charged, and if they need to be sentenced one day after a conviction, they're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=262.84s)]
*  going to want all of the credit and goodwill that they can generate with prosecutors. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=266.72s)]
*  So that tends to be the normal calculus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=270.92s)]
*  So Glenn, there's been a whole back and forth about the timeline here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=272.96s)]
*  That's a very diplomatic way of saying this, given Trump's team has asked for a trial in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=276.44s)]
*  2026. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=279.72s)]
*  Jack Smith's team replied and said that's bogus. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=282.56s)]
*  That date is going to be set, or we expect that date to be set coming up next Monday. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=286.36s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen here? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=291.68s)]
*  What's kind of a viable timeline for a trial? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, let's look at what Judge Chutkin said previously. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=296.0s)]
*  She said, you know, if the defendant continues to say things, to post things that might interfere [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  with our ability to pick a fair and impartial jury, might poison the jury pool, might intimidate [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=306.0s)]
*  witnesses, I will accelerate the trial date. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=311.56s)]
*  He has done some of those things. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  So I have a feeling Judge Chutkin is going to set a trial date in early 2024. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  I also think when the defense team, Trump's defense team, throws out a date that's two [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=321.84s)]
*  and a half to three years down the road, April 2026, it sort of shows that they're not really [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=326.65999999999997s)]
*  engaged in legitimate lawyering. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  It really feels like they're assistant campaign chairman at this point for Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=335.32s)]
*  It feels so ludicrous a little bit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  And that will help, I think, push Judge Chutkin to an earlier trial date if they're not really [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  trying to legitimately present a trial date that is an honest assessment of how much time [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=346.28s)]
*  they think they're going to need. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  So I can't wait until next Monday. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=352.8s)]
*  I want to see what Judge Chutkin does. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=354.56s)]
*  But I think she understands that everybody, including the American people, have a keen [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  interest in getting this case resolved well in advance of the 2024 election. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=361.24s)]
*  Do you agree on the timeline early next year? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=366.72s)]
*  I do agree if it's feasible. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=368.88s)]
*  I mean, I think out of all of these cases, I think the strongest imperative by far concerns [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=370.08s)]
*  the January 6th federal January 6th case and bringing that case to trial ideally as quickly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  as possible. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=379.88s)]
*  And I also agree that, you know, the setting of a trial date, any time you have kind of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=380.88s)]
*  litigation and competing positions, the parties can be a bit like settlement or like a bid [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=384.64s)]
*  and ask sort of scenario, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Prosecutors have put forward a date. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=390.08s)]
*  Trump's lawyers have put it forward a date that's so absurd that I think Chutkin will [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=391.88s)]
*  just set it aside, or it's very probable she'll set it aside, and that really sort of the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=394.88s)]
*  main kind of center of gravity is going to be the prosecutor's proposal. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  I have no idea how it will be resolved, but she does seem to have a keen awareness of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=401.96s)]
*  the significance of this case and its importance to the country. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=406.36s)]
*  Before I let you go on my legal education this evening, I wanted to ask you about Mark [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Meadows because there's a range of reporting about him cooperating, not cooperating, sharing [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  information, not. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=419.12s)]
*  We don't entirely know the totality of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=420.28s)]
*  But for each of you, and I'm going to start with you, Glenn, what's the best case scenario [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=422.2s)]
*  for Mark Meadows? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=426.2s)]
*  You know, he's in such a curious posture right now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=427.2s)]
*  This is like an action adventure legal thriller because all indicators were that he was cooperating [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=430.36s)]
*  with Jack Smith in the federal case, both in Washington and in the documents case in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=437.04s)]
*  Florida. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=442.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he pops up as a charged RICO defendant in Georgia. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=443.32s)]
*  Now, I will say when I had defendants and they had criminal exposure in multiple jurisdictions, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=448.56s)]
*  I worked very hard to try to to try to strike a global plea agreement that would resolve [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=453.76s)]
*  all of their criminal exposure so we could kind of keep our cooperator close. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=460.28s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be the case right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  So it feels like maybe he is helping Jack Smith. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=467.32s)]
*  Maybe he has not yet formalized a cooperation agreement. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=471.0s)]
*  And Jack Smith has said until that happens, you just go ahead and take care of your own [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=474.6s)]
*  little problems down in Georgia and maybe we'll circle back on that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Twh2ZXcP1A&t=478.84000000000003s)]
