# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and there are not a lot of things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=0.0s)]
*  that Americans are united on across our vast political divides that you could [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=3.6s)]
*  get a big majority of Americans to agree on. But a pretty big majority of us agree [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=7.32s)]
*  that Donald Trump is not very likeable and that Donald Trump is a loser. And the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=11.24s)]
*  reason that I'm starting off with those very obvious facts tonight is because [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=16.44s)]
*  Donald Trump and his supporters are trying to con us into forgetting them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=19.2s)]
*  And that persistent effort is part of what was so galling about the ex-presidents [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  town hall earlier this week. The truly awful part was not just that Donald [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=28.56s)]
*  Trump was given 70 minutes of national air time to say whatever he wanted, it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=32.48s)]
*  was the setting in which he did it. The town hall was presented to America with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=36.4s)]
*  an audience that whooped and hollered and laughed at every deranged thing that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=40.92s)]
*  came out of his mouth. It appeared to be unanimously supportive group and that is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  part of the con job that CNN was complicit in on Wednesday. In fact, according [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=50.08s)]
*  to a Republican political consultant who was at the town hall, the network [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=55.2s)]
*  encouraged that behavior. Quote, the floor manager came out ahead of time and said, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=58.24s)]
*  please do not boo. Please be respectful. You're allowed to applaud. Now, I have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  to say, as someone who's worked with live audiences quite a bit, actually, that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=66.8s)]
*  kind of direction when we're doing like a live show is accepted and sensible when [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=70.84s)]
*  you're doing a normal show. Right. But that's not what this was. This was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=76.56s)]
*  presented as a town hall with the presidential candidate as if it were an [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  actual forum in an organic setting with real unfettered reaction. And at least [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=84.36s)]
*  from the perspective of the Republican in the audience, what was portrayed on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=89.8s)]
*  air did not reflect the reality in the room. Quote, there were plenty of people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=93.12s)]
*  in that room that were ardent supporters of President Trump. And no matter what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=97.88s)]
*  he said, they were ready to jump out of their seats and applaud. But there were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=101.16s)]
*  also people that sat there quietly disgusted or bewildered. In a TV setting, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  you hear their applause, but you don't see the disgust. So Trump did not have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=108.72s)]
*  the entire room on his side. Make no mistake, even if it certainly came across [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=112.0s)]
*  that way on TV. Those observations are backed up by the data that we have. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=115.36s)]
*  While Donald Trump still has a lot of support within the Republican Party, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=122.12s)]
*  it is not unshakable. Another Trump nomination, another Trump presidential [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=125.04s)]
*  candidacy, is not inevitable. Yes, he is the front runner to win the nomination [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=129.8s)]
*  with a current polling average of 52 percent, far ahead of Florida Governor Ron [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=135.24s)]
*  DeSantis or any other challenger. Yes, he appears to be the strongest candidate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=138.88s)]
*  at the moment. There's no question a majority of Republicans do remain really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  disconcertingly trapped in Trump's alternate universe of delusion and lies, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=148.04s)]
*  particularly about the 2020 election. Fully 63 percent of Republicans and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=152.4s)]
*  Republican-leaning independents say that Joe Biden did not legitimately win. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=156.24s)]
*  But, but, and here's the big but, and this is key when we're looking at numbers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=160.12s)]
*  like that, right? The other part of that, the nearly 40 percent of that same group, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=163.32s)]
*  they do think the election was legitimate. That is something to work with. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a big chunk of people. That translates to tens of millions of potential [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=173.44s)]
*  voters, Republicans and those who lean that way, who see through what has become [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  the foundational big lie of Donald Trump and his candidacy. And that chunk of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=184.12s)]
*  people at 37 percent is also evidence it's way too soon for Republicans, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  conservatives, and everyone else to throw in the towel and give up, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  to resign themselves to another Trump win in the Republican primary, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=197.64s)]
*  not actually go out and make the argument against him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=201.64s)]
*  During that town hall while we were doing our show here the other night, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=206.32s)]
*  I had on my dear friend, Rachel Meadow, and we were talking about this very topic, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  which is that democracy requires making arguments to people, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=215.76s)]
*  persuading people, communicating with and mobilizing them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=221.16s)]
*  There is an argument to make to Republican primary voters that Donald Trump [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=224.96s)]
*  is stuck in the past. He's a loser who can't move on from his loss and his lie [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=229.2s)]
*  about the 2020 election. And as the data show, there is a receptive audience for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=235.44s)]
*  that. We also heard it from several Republican primary voters in a focus group [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=239.2s)]
*  that CNN, to their credit, convened after the town hall. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=243.84s)]
*  I think it's time to move on from the election, the 2020 election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  I'd like him to move on. I would like him to stop talking about it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=252.96s)]
*  I don't think anybody wants to hear about 2020 at this point. Everybody wants to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=256.64s)]
*  hear about 2024, the future and what comes after that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=260.12s)]
*  Personally, I'm getting tired of hearing about it. I'm very much more so interested [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=263.44s)]
*  in the problems that we face now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=267.76s)]
*  I definitely do think he believes it. I think he's very passionate about it, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=269.68s)]
*  or else he probably wouldn't still be talking about it. But I think that it's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=273.04s)]
*  time for him to move on. He needs to talk about what he's going to accomplish in 2024. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, let me be clear here, OK, given where I'm coming from, my concern about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=280.24s)]
*  the state of American democracy, my own personal politics, personally, I think, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=284.56s)]
*  well, let's move on. Is insufficient as an argument against Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=287.52s)]
*  But what it is, crucially, is an opening. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=293.12s)]
*  In politics, you have to find those kinds of openings and then you wedge yourself [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=297.04s)]
*  in and you push them out wider. That's the job for anyone who wants to win back [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=300.88s)]
*  the Republican Party from Donald Trump. I can't do it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=306.8s)]
*  Believe me, I wish I could. But Republican primary voters are not going to listen to me. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=310.96s)]
*  Maybe some of them. Maybe some of you are watching right now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=315.68s)]
*  And I'm glad you are. But in the main, the people who want the Republican [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=317.64s)]
*  nomination, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  whoever else can declare, they're the ones who need to make this argument. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=325.96s)]
*  Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who is running for the Republican [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=330.24s)]
*  presidential nomination, is, to his tremendous credit, one of the very few [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=333.8s)]
*  starting to hit that message. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=337.6s)]
*  Also, you know, going after him is like walking into a buzzsaw. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=340.48s)]
*  Why are you doing it? Well, because it's important. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  What America does not want is another repeat of 2020 where we have Joe Biden [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  and Donald Trump running against each other. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  We've also heard it from potential 2024 candidate Chris Christie, who referred to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=356.92s)]
*  Trump as, quote, a child for fixating in 2020. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=361.0s)]
*  And Chris Sununu, governor of New Hampshire, who called him a loser and said he is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=363.68s)]
*  tired of losing. So clearly some Republicans are catching on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=367.24s)]
*  But I got to say, there's a strange sort of fatalism creeping into the natural [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=371.72s)]
*  conversation about Donald Trump that everyone should sort of throw in the towel [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=375.52s)]
*  and give up. And what that means to me, honestly, is give up on our fellow [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=379.44s)]
*  citizens, the people that we share the country with as as Democratic equals, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=383.72s)]
*  right? Small D, Democratic equals. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=387.32s)]
*  And I got to say, it certainly seems like the Republican establishment has even [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=389.92s)]
*  more cynical views of their primary voters than I do. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=393.08s)]
*  But the door is not closed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=398.2s)]
*  I mean, maybe it will be at some point, and maybe Donald Trump wins the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  nomination perfectly plausible and maybe even likely. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=402.96s)]
*  But it's not inevitable. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=405.92s)]
*  The future is unwritten. People who want him not to be the nominee need to get up [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=407.4s)]
*  and make the case to their own voters. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=412.44s)]
*  Get out there. Democracy depends on it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=414.44s)]
*  Matthew Bartlett is a Republican strategist, I quoted earlier, who was in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=417.2s)]
*  the audience for the Trump Town Hall. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=420.28s)]
*  He previously served as a director of the public affairs at the State Department [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=421.52s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=425.08s)]
*  Jennifer Horn served as the chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=426.24s)]
*  She left the GOP in December 2020. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=429.28s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=431.4s)]
*  Matthew, let me start with you as just someone who's in that room. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  I was so interested in hearing your account of that and just the sort of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=434.48s)]
*  nuance to people's reaction. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=439.52s)]
*  Just give a sense of how you're reading people throughout and what you're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=441.68s)]
*  picking up that maybe the cameras weren't. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=447.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=449.16s)]
*  I think you had a typical New Hampshire Town Hall in so much as you had a wide [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=450.16s)]
*  group of Republicans, independents, some that were supporters of President Trump [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=455.16s)]
*  and there to see him, and some that came with a true deal of skepticism around him. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=460.16s)]
*  As you mentioned, there was a notion to try to keep decorum in the room, to try to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=466.16s)]
*  make sure that this did not go off the rails and that people were allowed to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=471.16s)]
*  express themselves through applause. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=476.16s)]
*  That clearly became a bit of an issue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=477.16s)]
*  Certainly when I turned on my cell phone afterwards, the text messages started [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=480.16s)]
*  coming in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=485.16s)]
*  My gosh, it looked like Trump had the entire room. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=486.16s)]
*  And just being there, it certainly didn't feel that way when there was a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=488.16s)]
*  scattering of applause or even a loud applause. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=492.16s)]
*  I do not believe that it was the entire room. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=495.16s)]
*  I certainly think it was a lot of the people that, you know, like President Trump, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=498.16s)]
*  like his style, like his personality. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=502.16s)]
*  But there were others there that sat, you know, again, bewildered or absolutely [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=504.16s)]
*  disgusted to hear him talk about January 6, to hear him talk about the libel case. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=509.16s)]
*  Some of this was very unfamiliar verbiage to the crowd. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  And I don't think they knew what to actually make of it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  I just want to make sure, and I really, really appreciate you coming on and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=522.1600000000001s)]
*  sharing this, because I think it's actually a really important perspective. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  As someone who makes TV, I know that sometimes what the camera is capturing and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  what the room is like are a little distant. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=531.16s)]
*  But I just want to make sure that you're not projecting how you were feeling when [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=533.16s)]
*  you said like people were disgusted, like you're seeing that in people's faces, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=536.16s)]
*  right, that you could feel that actually that's not just how you felt. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=540.16s)]
*  Yeah, and just to be clear, I was an appointee at the State Department under [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=545.16s)]
*  President Trump, and proud of the work I did, I resigned on January 6 right [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=549.16s)]
*  behind, you know, the Capitol here, walking home. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=553.16s)]
*  And I remember vividly seeing it filled with what I thought was an absolute [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=556.16s)]
*  disgrace. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=561.16s)]
*  Now, I've heard other Republicans talk about some conspiracy theories as to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=562.16s)]
*  this was an organized effort or this was Antifa. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=566.16s)]
*  I've never heard anyone refer to it as a beautiful day. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=570.16s)]
*  And I was mere feet from the president hearing him talk about that, a day where I [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=574.16s)]
*  resigned. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=579.16s)]
*  I thought it was an absolute disgrace. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=580.16s)]
*  I thought it was disgusting. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=582.16s)]
*  And, you know, I'm just happy to say that the entire room did not feel that way. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=584.16s)]
*  Jennifer, I, again, I'm not the messenger here, but I am invested in this because [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=588.16s)]
*  I actually think it's very important for the country, particularly because he [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=592.16s)]
*  really does seem to be running on a campaign of like I'm going to finish the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=596.16s)]
*  job from January 6. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=599.16s)]
*  It seems to me the best argument here is more than move on, it's that he's a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=601.16s)]
*  loser who lost and he's going to lose again. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=605.16s)]
*  And the thing that that ties together is confronting the reality of the fact [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=608.16s)]
*  that he lost to Joe Biden, a person that I think most Republican primary voters [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=612.16s)]
*  view as sort of incompetent and too old and it's ridiculous that that is the guy [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=617.16s)]
*  that he lost to. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=624.16s)]
*  It does seem to me the message here to drive home more than anything is he's a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=625.16s)]
*  loser who lost and will lose again. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=630.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=634.16s)]
*  A three-time loser who lost and is guaranteed to lose again in the general [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=635.16s)]
*  election. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=639.16s)]
*  You know, I listened carefully to the numbers that you were quoting in the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=640.16s)]
*  opening there, Chris, and what we're missing, what we're sort of not remembering [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=644.16s)]
*  maybe, I was there in 2016. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=649.16s)]
*  The President Trump only won about 30, 33% maybe of the primary vote in New [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=652.16s)]
*  Hampshire and that's all he needs to win continuously to get the nomination as [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=659.16s)]
*  long as the field is as crowded as it's going to be now. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=666.16s)]
*  So you want us to be able to convince primary voters, Republican primary voters, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=670.16s)]
*  so that he doesn't end up being the nominee again. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=675.16s)]
*  The problem is there are already too many people in the race, in the primary race, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=678.16s)]
*  number one, and number two, that 30, 33% are going to stay with him and as this [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=683.16s)]
*  primary unfolds, it's going to, in my opinion, my very strong opinion, is that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=691.16s)]
*  it's going to go in the other direction. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=696.16s)]
*  He's going to pick up more votes, not lose them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=697.16s)]
*  So what you're talking here, I just want to be clear, and I'm going to come back [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=701.16s)]
*  to you in a second, Matthew, just like the delegate math, which is different in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=704.16s)]
*  the RNC than it is in the DNC, so it's a winner-take-all system. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=708.16s)]
*  They haven't changed that, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=711.16s)]
*  So if you win by, you know, a percentage point, you take all the delegates from [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=712.16s)]
*  that state, so you can run the board with, you know, if there's enough candidates [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=716.16s)]
*  and you're running against them 31%, 32% state after state after state, you're [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=720.16s)]
*  not taking that proportional share of delegates, you're actually taking the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=724.16s)]
*  whole state, which is the way you could springboard from 30, 32% against a [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=726.16s)]
*  crowded field to the nomination. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=731.16s)]
*  But the delegate math aside, my question to you is like, what is your [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=734.16s)]
*  characterization, just of the group of the folks that you know that are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=739.16s)]
*  Republican, conservative voters in New Hampshire, of like the locked-in, no-way, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=743.16s)]
*  hell-or-high-water, they will vote for Trump and the non-that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=749.16s)]
*  You're asking me, I assume. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=754.16s)]
*  Jennifer, let me go to you and then you, Matthew. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=756.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=759.16s)]
*  So here's what I think about the Republican primary voters in New Hampshire. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=760.16s)]
*  And again, I'm going to go back to one of the numbers that you used, you know, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=766.16s)]
*  the idea that there are almost 40% of Republican primary voters who say that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=769.16s)]
*  they'd rather not see Donald Trump be the nominee. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=774.16s)]
*  But the question that you're not asking them is, if he is, will you vote for him? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=777.16s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=781.16s)]
*  Are you going to stand behind him? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=782.16s)]
*  But the reason that that matters so much is you just have to understand that's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=783.16s)]
*  the mindset of the GOP primary voters down the aisle, across the spectrum. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=788.16s)]
*  They are going to be all in for Trump if he ends up as the nominee. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=794.16s)]
*  During Wednesday's debacle of a town hall, Donald Trump made it abundantly clear. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=798.16s)]
*  He's running to finish the job he started on January 6th. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=805.16s)]
*  The indicted ex-president showed no remorse for the insurrection he incited. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=808.16s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=812.16s)]
*  As part of an attempt to overturn the results of a free and fair election, he lost. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=813.16s)]
*  Rather, he once again said he would pardon many of the insurrectionists who acted as [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=816.16s)]
*  the foot soldiers in his war on American democracy on what he called a beautiful day. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=821.16s)]
*  In case you needed even more convincing that Trump is gearing up once again to attack [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=826.16s)]
*  the very foundations of American democracy, look at who he wants by his side in the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=831.16s)]
*  White House next time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=835.16s)]
*  A new report in Rolling Stone says Trump is considering a key administration position [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=837.16s)]
*  for Michael Flynn, the disgraced former national security adviser who pled guilty to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=841.16s)]
*  lying to the FBI about communications he had with a Russian official and reportedly [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=846.16s)]
*  floated invoking martial law to help overturn the 2020 election. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=850.16s)]
*  Trump is also apparently angling once again to put Jeffrey Clark in a top job. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=855.16s)]
*  He's the formerly obscure DOJ staffer who tried to get himself installed as attorney [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=860.16s)]
*  general of the United States after the 2020 election so he could sort of commandeer the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=865.16s)]
*  entire Department of Justice to weaponize it on behalf of Donald Trump and overturn [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=869.16s)]
*  the results to install Trump as the winner. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=874.16s)]
*  Joining me now is Noah Schachman, editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone, which broke this latest [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=877.16s)]
*  reporting on Trump's inner circle. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=881.16s)]
*  Noah, I guess I'd first start with, you know, Trump says a lot of things and there's a [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=883.16s)]
*  lot of people around him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=887.16s)]
*  How sure are we that these are people that he really still thinks of as loyalists and [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=889.16s)]
*  wants to have in the admin? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=894.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're pretty sure, man. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=896.16s)]
*  Look, these are people that Trump has been, in the case of Flynn, right, he's been a Trump [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=898.16s)]
*  ally since before the 2016 election. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=904.16s)]
*  Flynn famously stood up for Trump at the Republican National Convention in 2016, and Trump [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=907.16s)]
*  loves that kind of loyalty. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=913.16s)]
*  Similarly, Jeffrey Clark was one of the key architects in this harebrained scheme to try [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=915.16s)]
*  to have alternate electors in the 2020 election in key battleground states, and Trump loves [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=922.16s)]
*  that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=930.16s)]
*  And if you go on Jeffrey Clark's Twitter feed now, it is nothing but Trump, Trump, Trump, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=931.16s)]
*  Trump, Trump, mega, mega, mega. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=936.16s)]
*  And so, yeah, he is really serious about both of these guys. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=938.16s)]
*  With Clark, he has floated the idea of him becoming attorney general for real this time, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=941.16s)]
*  which is nuts. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=947.16s)]
*  And with Flynn, he recognizes that Flynn is so toxic that he couldn't pass a Senate confirmation [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=948.16s)]
*  hearing, and so he's looking for some other role in the national security apparatus for [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=956.16s)]
*  him. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=960.16s)]
*  Yeah, let me read from Swin Suph's great reporting on this. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=961.16s)]
*  On Clark, Trump's enthusiasm for Clark comes in spite of his mounting legal troubles, which [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=965.16s)]
*  are something to keep in mind here, which are directly related to his and Trump's schemes to [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=969.16s)]
*  subvert the Democratic order. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=973.16s)]
*  FBI agents searched Clark's home, seized his phone as part of special counsel Jack Smith's [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=975.16s)]
*  investigation into efforts to subvert the 2020 election. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=981.16s)]
*  And then on the case of Flynn, in at least one conversation, Trump was self-aware enough to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=984.16s)]
*  say any senior role for Flynn would probably have to be a non-Senate confirmed appointment. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=988.16s)]
*  One of the things I think that's come through here is there's the team crazy and team normal [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=994.16s)]
*  distinction that Bill Stepien talked about in that January 6 committee deposition. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1000.16s)]
*  Now, frankly, I think that's a bit much because Bill Stepien was there most of the time, so it was [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1005.16s)]
*  self-serving. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1010.16s)]
*  But what was clear is that there's that one meeting, the nutty meeting where the overstock guy is [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1011.16s)]
*  there and I don't know who else. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1017.16s)]
*  Those group of people, that's going to be the core of the government in a Trump second term. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1019.16s)]
*  That seems very clear. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1027.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and at least at this point, like team crazy is ready to take over and become the team. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1029.1599999999999s)]
*  Look, Clark, this is just how wild and how nutty this guy is. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1037.1599999999999s)]
*  You may remember there's an infamous meeting in the White House in which the very Trumpy director of [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  national intelligence, Radcliffe, said, look, we have no evidence whatsoever that a foreign power [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1047.16s)]
*  interfered in the vote tallies. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1053.16s)]
*  And this guy, Clark, he said, wait a minute, I've heard that the Dominion voting machines, yeah, that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1056.16s)]
*  Dominion, the same one that was in the fight with Fox, the Dominion voting machines were hacked by [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1063.16s)]
*  China because of some kind of smart thermostat hookup. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1068.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1072.16s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the person that he was trying to get to sort of topple the DOJ. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1074.16s)]
*  We should also note that, again, Swin's reporting here says that he's considering the people that he [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1080.16s)]
*  this is not hidden in the sense that there's this Trump-aligned event happening, I think, at Dural. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1086.16s)]
*  And you've got there Michael Flynn, Mike Pillow is going to be there, Peter Navarro is going to be there, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1091.16s)]
*  Roger Stone, Devin Nunes, Eric Trump, a few like out and out anti-Hemmett semi-slash Holocaust deniers did [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1098.16s)]
*  get booted from the bill, I think, after my colleague Rachel Maddow brought some attention to them. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1106.16s)]
*  But again, the waters he's swimming in are solely these waters, as far as I can tell, and based on [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1110.16s)]
*  Swin and others reporting. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1116.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1119.16s)]
*  And the other part of this is there's a heavy Christian nationalist part to it, too. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1121.16s)]
*  Flynn in particular has built this infrastructure over the last several years in which he is trying to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1125.16s)]
*  basically subvert religion, subvert Christianity in support of Donald Trump, who is not exactly a holy guy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1131.16s)]
*  But they have made it their mission to kind of suborn Christianity in support of their kind of neo-fasci [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1143.16s)]
*  political agenda. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1150.16s)]
*  And Flynn is right at the center of that. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNslhK4s5as&t=1152.16s)]
