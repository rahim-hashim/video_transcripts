# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA)
*  Good evening from Los Angeles. I'm Jason Johnson and for Chris Hayes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=0.0s)]
*  We're waiting for the special counsel to respond to Donald Trump's wildly expansive claim of presidential immunity [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=4.16s)]
*  Trump says he can't be prosecuted for January 6 because he was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial and he contends that he is quote [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=10.36s)]
*  absolute immunity from prosecution for his official acts as president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=18.52s)]
*  Jack Smith is expected to respond to those claims before the appeals court [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=22.44s)]
*  Here's arguments on Trump's immunity claims on January 6th all [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=26.52s)]
*  Rulings on the January 6th case are currently on hold while that appeals process plays out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=30.84s)]
*  But that didn't stop the special counsel from filing a new motion with Judge Chanya Chutkin today [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=35.24s)]
*  Asking the court to not allow quote the defendant to turn the courtroom into a forum in which he propagates irrelevant [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Disinformation and should reject his attempt to inject politics into this proceeding [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=49.0s)]
*  Smith also wants the court to quote [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Prohibit the defendant from introducing evidence making arguments or framing questions to advance a theory of selective or vindictive [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  prosecution [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=64.28s)]
*  basically special counsel wants to make sure Trump can't say this is Joe Biden's DOJ targeting him and in response [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=66.08s)]
*  Trump said Joe Biden's DOJ is targeting him a rant by the ex-president called Jack Smith crooked [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's errand boy and a campaign email that went out just hours after the filing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=78.92s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is Ryan Reilly justice reporter for NBC News and author of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=84.16s)]
*  Sedition hunters how January 6 broke the justice system Ryan. Thanks so much for joining me this evening. Look, I have to start with this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=89.36s)]
*  So one part of the ruling we're waiting to hear [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=97.92s)]
*  Jacksmith is basically laying out to judge Chutkin. I don't want Trump to do the thing that we know that Trump is going to do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  Is this working the refs is this sort of saying hey [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=110.4s)]
*  Hey, you know that you know that Shaq is gonna spend more than three seconds in the key [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=113.72s)]
*  Is he working the refs here or does he actually think that judge Chutkin is going to be able to stop Trump from doing? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=117.44s)]
*  The thing that he always does [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=122.92s)]
*  Hey Jason, you know [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=125.52s)]
*  I think that this has happened in case separate case before with other January 6th defendants where they've tried to bring up these sort of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=126.56s)]
*  irrelevant [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=132.68s)]
*  Charges that aren't based in any fact or reality about the FBI sort of setting up January 6 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=133.8s)]
*  This notion that the FBI was controlling these figures behind the scenes who were directing these Trump supporters to do these terrible things [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=140.4s)]
*  And oh what lo and behold I thought I got caught and did something I wasn't supposed to do [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=147.52s)]
*  And you know it I think it sort of speaks to the failure of the January 6th committee in some respects [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=152.48s)]
*  Because the January 6th committee didn't end up focusing a lot on the FBI failures that lead up to January [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=157.36s)]
*  Let up to January 6 and because of that you have a lot of people who are willing to sort of accept these these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=162.68s)]
*  bizarre conspiracy theories that all lean on this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  idea that the FBI is extremely competent and was pulling these things behind the scenes when in reality [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=171.84s)]
*  There were just a bunch of failures that led up to January 6 and what happened is a bunch of Trump supporters thought that the election [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=176.8s)]
*  Was stolen and stormed the Capitol what happened is pretty simple [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=182.8s)]
*  But they're trying to bring in all of these other facts around it and trying to or other [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=186.12s)]
*  Disinformation around it and trying to pretend like there's some grander conspiracy here that the FBI is all behind it having read through thousands [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Of pages of FBI emails. I mean it should be ridiculous on its face [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  But once you read these emails and see how many problems there were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  There were from the FBI in the lead-up to January 6 it really starts to seem absolutely ridiculous [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  It's always interesting to me Ryan that that anti-government conspiracy theorists think the government is terrible and competent [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=210.88s)]
*  until it suits their conspiracy theory and then suddenly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=217.2s)]
*  They're all geniuses and all able to do everything that they want them to do [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Speaking of this, I think this conspiracy is key and the Smith filing he talks about this idea of undercover agents [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  And he says look we don't want to allow defendants to introduce evidence about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=229.28s)]
*  Undercover actors because that would inevitably lead to confusing many trials on collateral issues [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=233.16s)]
*  Such as the identities and intentions of the alleged undercover actors [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=238.6s)]
*  For example, it may require the government to introduce evidence to show that people whom the defendant alleges were undercover actuars were actually his [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  vehement supporters [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=249.66s)]
*  Ryan you've written about this and I find this to be one of the most critical elements of any prosecution about Trump on January 6 [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=251.22s)]
*  How can we stop that from happening? How can you prove a negative? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=259.3s)]
*  Because Trump supporters as you sort of pointed out have long pushed this theory that this is all this sort of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=262.98s)]
*  Scooby-doo conspiracy theory that if you pull off the mask it was antifree [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=267.94s)]
*  But if you pull off the other mask is the Trump supporter, but that person is innocent. How do you stop that in court? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=271.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's almost comical but it does become this big distraction and this big time waster [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=276.7s)]
*  There's a recent case and I wrote about this last week [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  But there's even a more recent case since my piece last week [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=284.0s)]
*  Involving someone that people let alleged were was a antifa supporter who ended up up low and behold just to be a Trump supporter [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=287.42s)]
*  But it's happened time and time again [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  one of the sort of most hilarious examples to me is that there's an [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=295.06s)]
*  Individual who two people on the very day of there were two people dressed in black and people were yelling in the crowd at that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=299.82s)]
*  Moment getting sucked into these conspiracies theory saying they're antifa they're antifa [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=305.72s)]
*  What was that based on basically if you're wearing black or if you're smashing windows you were automatically assumed to be antifa, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=309.62s)]
*  There was not like a deep inquiry into the political ideology of the individuals smashing the windows at the time [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  It was just like oh they have to be antifa and then lo and behold [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=321.82000000000005s)]
*  One of them was guy who went around to Trump rallies was one of the quote-unquote [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  Front-row Joe's who went to Trump rallies because he he went around the country got in line [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  It was one of the first people in line for a lot of Trump rallies [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=333.86s)]
*  The other individual was actually just arrested more recently and he's also a deep Trump supporter [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=336.26s)]
*  I went back and scrolled through his Facebook page back in 2020 and you know [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=341.82s)]
*  It's pro-trump meme after pro-trump meme anti-biden meme after anti-biden meme [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=346.18s)]
*  And then there's the fact of course that he tried to storm the Capitol after Donald Trump said you have to fight like hell [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  So it just happens time and time again where there's supposed to be this next mystery under the you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  It's gonna be under the next door and they just fail over and over and over again [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=361.0s)]
*  But at some point it kind of gets into the you know [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=364.5s)]
*  A lot of people start to believe it and a lot of Trump supporters really do believe that this was some undercover antifa operation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=367.24s)]
*  And so Donald Trump would if he has the opportunity to take advantage of that to any extent that he could [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=373.2s)]
*  Right [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=378.46s)]
*  Ron Riley, thank you so much for starting us off this evening [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=379.73999999999995s)]
*  It was a history-making year in the House of Representatives for all the wrong reasons first Republicans took [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=383.78s)]
*  15 ballots just to elect a speaker the most since the Civil War [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=389.9s)]
*  They made history again when just months later. They ousted that speaker [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=394.14s)]
*  then the house was effectively shut down for three weeks as [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=398.62s)]
*  Republicans tried and failed over and over and over to choose a new speaker and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=402.78s)]
*  They finally elected a new speaker one of their first orders of business and highest priorities was to launch a sham impeachment inquiry of President Biden [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=407.94s)]
*  And now there are reports that they could slow walk that investigation drawing it out during election year [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=415.98s)]
*  That inquiry is one of the only [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=422.5s)]
*  achievements of this Congress [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=425.06s)]
*  Look at this chart from Axios using data compiled by the data analytics firm quorum [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=427.06s)]
*  It shows that the number of laws passed by each two-year congressional session since 1989 hundreds of bills [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  Until you get to right now halfway through the 118th congressional session see that tiny [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=439.7s)]
*  sliver of red at the end that represents the 20 bills that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=445.5s)]
*  passed both chambers and became law this year and the additional four bills awaiting President Biden signature and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=450.82s)]
*  The vast majority of those bills were pretty minor like quote [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=457.58s)]
*  Multiple measures to rename Veterans Affairs clinics and another to mint a coin commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=462.02s)]
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat from Texas who serves on the Oversight Committee and she joins me now congressman Crockett [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=471.26s)]
*  It is an honor to speak to you for reasons. I'm gonna explain when we talk [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=478.18s)]
*  I have to start with this you are a freshman in Congress, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=482.14s)]
*  This is your first time in the job, but you have been a state legislator before [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=486.05999999999995s)]
*  Have you been shocked at the lack of productivity and functionality that you've seen in Congress since you got into office? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=491.5s)]
*  Absolutely. First of all, it's great to see you Jason [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=500.17999999999995s)]
*  And you know coming out of one of the craziest sessions in the Texas house as a freshman and then coming to the US House [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  I thought well nothing can get crazier, but clearly I spoke too soon [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=510.42s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are not serious and at the end of the day what Democrats need to go ahead and say over and over and over [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=515.26s)]
*  Is you can't believe they're lying mouths as soon as they talk a lot is coming out [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=522.06s)]
*  Because we can just look at the numbers the data shows that they're not delivering and if you don't want to listen to us [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=527.86s)]
*  I listen to the data then listen to my good friend ship Roy out of the state of Texas when he says [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=533.02s)]
*  That they have not done anything [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=538.54s)]
*  We need to make sure that we get serious people elected into office and get this country moving in the proper direction [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=540.3s)]
*  Yeah to quote one of my favorite shows [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=547.54s)]
*  These are not serious people and it makes it difficult to do the people's work an example of this [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=549.62s)]
*  I've got to lay this out. So you have the Oversight Committee [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=555.0999999999999s)]
*  Making one of their priorities heading into 2024 [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=559.9s)]
*  This this impeachment into Joe Biden and they're looking for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=562.98s)]
*  Seeking any communications between the White House and lawyers for Hunter Biden about efforts to depose the president's son [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=566.5s)]
*  It's part of their impeachment inquiry [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=572.46s)]
*  The GOP chairman said they're seeking to determine whether the president was involved in his son's decision not to comply with congressional suspien [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=574.02s)]
*  Look, I I've made it abundantly clear that I don't think that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=580.82s)]
*  Any sort of investigation that the hunter Biden is really worth the people's time [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=585.02s)]
*  Not when you've got Jared and Ivanka walking around the country [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=588.78s)]
*  But as a member of Congress and being on the Oversight Committee [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=591.14s)]
*  What's your response when you hear that that your colleagues want to spend the people's time? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=594.26s)]
*  Investigating hunter Biden instead of addressing gas prices inflation [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=600.62s)]
*  Healthcare the environment the kinds of things that people actually want to vote on [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=605.26s)]
*  Yeah, you know it outrages me and so most of the time when I'm in oversight you see me get snarky [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=609.3s)]
*  You see me get passionate and that is because when I was sent to DC I was sent to DC to work [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  I have a district where 20% of my population live at or below poverty [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  they need me to bring real results home because it can be life or death in [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=626.74s)]
*  Texas we lead an uninsured in North Texas specifically in my district. We lead in the entire state [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  So we have real issues. I didn't campaign on nonsense. I campaigned on bettering people's lives [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=637.9799999999999s)]
*  That means economically that means in the housing sphere that means in education that means in freedom overall [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=643.54s)]
*  These are the things I campaigned on and so I really want to do the people's work [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=650.1s)]
*  But let me tell you this Jason one of the amazing things about coming into this session [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=654.14s)]
*  Has been all the amazing work that went into the last session [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=658.1s)]
*  I've been able to just drop off check after check after check [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=661.58s)]
*  I brought home almost two hundred million dollars to my district not because of anything happened in this session [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=665.06s)]
*  But because of everything that happened when Joe Biden had a Democratic House as well as the Democratic Senate [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=670.7s)]
*  So I want to say this you are the most shared member of Congress amongst my students [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=678.3s)]
*  You went on the Reckless Club recently [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=683.94s)]
*  I want to play you some audio from that get your thoughts on the other side and what your impact might be as a sort [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=686.32s)]
*  of surrogate in 2024 [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=691.66s)]
*  Because I feel like you need people like her to be translators, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  I've always felt like the messaging from the Democratic Party sucks [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=698.1s)]
*  That's a nice way of putting it yeah, okay [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=704.14s)]
*  She's been able to translate it up in a very digestible way for people absolutely and you know [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=706.38s)]
*  It's just one of those things I say the Democrats love to write a thesis [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=711.9s)]
*  Yes, when really when it comes to the Republicans they like I want to know cars [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=715.82s)]
*  Like what are cliff notes and that's what we need to do [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=720.2s)]
*  People are busy trying to figure out how they're gonna keep a roof over their head keep food in their bellies keep gas in the car and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=723.12s)]
*  We're giving out what literally look [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=729.96s)]
*  So comes from Crockett one of the reasons like I said that I mentioned that I have my students [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=735.28s)]
*  I'm a professor at Morgan State University. It's HBC you you are actually a member of Congress that my students know of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=740.16s)]
*  What do you think your role could be in? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=746.36s)]
*  As a surrogate who actually seems to be able to deliver a message because one of the biggest reasons for Biden sort of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=749.22s)]
*  Questionable poll numbers is because young people especially young black people and people of color seem to think he doesn't have a message for them [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=755.82s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, I'm gonna do everything that I can to make sure that president Biden and vice president [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=763.38s)]
*  Kamala Harris are reelected and not necessarily because they're Democrats [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=768.3s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=773.1s)]
*  It has everything to do with democracy in and of itself and I think that I make it plain [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=774.82s)]
*  So many people are trying to make it about the individuals themselves and to be clear [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=779.9000000000001s)]
*  They both have amazing records to run on I don't want to diminish that right [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=784.5s)]
*  But we've got to make sure that when we're telling the stories about their record that we're telling them in ways that people can understand [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=788.74s)]
*  We also have to make sure that we let people know that Trump is an existential threat to all of us [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=795.1s)]
*  And as I said when I did that interview we won't always agree we don't always agree with our spouses [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=802.26s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we don't love them [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=808.5400000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean that they're not gonna act in what they believe is our best interest and that is the point right now [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=810.6600000000001s)]
*  I can tell you thank God my my district probably doesn't pay attention to every single vote that I make [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=816.26s)]
*  But you know, I'm sure that somebody disagrees with a vote here and there [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=821.98s)]
*  but at the end of the day [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=826.3000000000001s)]
*  You got to know that my heart is in the right place and I'm doing everything that I can and that's the exact same thing [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=827.7s)]
*  That we're getting out of the president [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=833.22s)]
*  You may not agree with everything this administration does but just know that they are doing their darndest [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=834.7s)]
*  When they tried to deliver on student loan debt [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=840.7s)]
*  They didn't get you because of what Trump had done right because of who he had put on the Supreme Court as he stole seats [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not that they're not trying and I also need people to understand that he's not the president of the world a [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=849.6600000000001s)]
*  President is a president for us of the United States and we have two other branches [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=856.22s)]
*  So y'all need to pay attention [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=861.34s)]
*  So who all is going to be on this team to help this president execute an agenda that we can all live with [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=862.82s)]
*  Very quickly one of your colleagues that you have often had to put in their place [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=871.26s)]
*  Lauren Boebert has recently announced that she is going to be running in a different congressional district in [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=875.62s)]
*  2024 I guess they can make her appear [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=882.1s)]
*  They if they say her name three times [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=884.42s)]
*  What do you think that indicates about the fact that you know this member of Congress who was a firebrand and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=886.42s)]
*  insurrectionist often isn't necessarily doing their job now has to flee to another district to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=893.54s)]
*  Possibly get back into Congress [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=899.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that this is the warning sign that the Republicans know they can see [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=901.42s)]
*  What's happening? They know that a Lauren Boebert and honestly it doesn't really matter [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=907.14s)]
*  What Republican you run in that district when we look at the Republicans that are currently sitting in the house regardless of what they say [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=912.04s)]
*  They elected [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=919.8s)]
*  Unanimously to put maga mic at the head of the house. So I don't care if they say they're middle ground [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't care if they want to claim that they're not like the Lauren Boebert's of the world [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=927.9599999999999s)]
*  But they did that along with voting for the impeachment inquiry on Joe Biden [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=933.0s)]
*  Even when people like Ken Buck said there's not enough here. So let me tell you right now [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=938.28s)]
*  Republicans are all maga based on their voting record, but they know that a Lauren Boebert cannot win in a swing district [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=944.64s)]
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett. Thank you most for joining us this evening. Good to see you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=954.48s)]
*  You [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupU2WIdHcA&t=968.12s)]
