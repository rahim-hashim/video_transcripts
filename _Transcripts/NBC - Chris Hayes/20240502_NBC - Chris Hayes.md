# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights May 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today one of the nation's most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  punishing and restrictive abortion bans went into effect in the third largest [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  state in the Union. In the state of Florida it is now a felony to quote [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=8.16s)]
*  perform or actively participate in an abortion after six weeks gestation. That [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=12.66s)]
*  is just two weeks after a missed period. It's before many many women even know [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  that they are pregnant. The ban does at least statutorily provide exceptions for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=23.0s)]
*  rape, incest, human trafficking up to 15 weeks of pregnancy and to save a woman's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=28.28s)]
*  life or to prevent quote substantial and irreversible physical impairment. But [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=33.2s)]
*  what we have learned from those exceptions in other states and what [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  providers in Florida say is that they don't work, that there will be very [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=40.8s)]
*  serious consequences. A Florida doctor telling NBC News quote it's going to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  cause delays in care that are going to cost women significant health hazards or [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=49.24s)]
*  risks. So as of today 17 states ban all or most abortions including the entire [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=53.56s)]
*  south that block there from Texas to Florida. Three more states ban the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=60.52s)]
*  procedure after 12 or 15 weeks. One of those three Arizona recently upheld a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=65.12s)]
*  Civil War era law banning nearly all abortions. Today just two Republicans in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  the entire state Senate joined all Democrats in the state Senate to repeal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=77.48s)]
*  the 1864 law. It's still expected to go into effect for a limited period of time [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=82.28s)]
*  over the summer before reverting back to that 15 week ban. In all in this country [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=87.24s)]
*  in 2024 as we head towards this election one in three women of reproductive age [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=93.36s)]
*  lives in a state with an abortion ban. That's a reality in America and the man [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=99.0s)]
*  responsible who has a 50-50 chance of getting back in the White House next [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=104.24s)]
*  year believes he did the country a great service. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=107.96s)]
*  It was always the plan from the great legal experts of this country and even [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  the world. They wanted to get abortion out of the federal government. Everybody [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=120.0s)]
*  wanted that. That was uniform. So what's happened is now the states decide and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=123.88s)]
*  they're going to votes in different states and it's been an amazing process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=128.24s)]
*  But basically the states decide on abortion and people are absolutely [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=132.4s)]
*  thrilled with the way that's going on. You can keep saying that but it's not [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=139.72s)]
*  going to make it true. The majority of this country is not thrilled with what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=144.52s)]
*  Donald Trump did to reproductive rights. Not thrilled with women having to bleed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=149.24s)]
*  out in parking lots before they can get into hospitals being medevaced out of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=154.52s)]
*  hospitals in states like Idaho. They're not thrilled with that and he has not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=159.56s)]
*  been getting anywhere near the level of blame that he deserves. Today in Florida [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=163.96s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris pointedly gave Trump full credit for the abortion [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=168.72s)]
*  bans. At the stroke of midnight another Trump abortion ban went into effect here [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=173.48s)]
*  in Florida. As of this morning four million women in this state woke up with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=182.48s)]
*  fewer reproductive freedoms than they had last night. This is the new reality [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=192.28s)]
*  under a Trump abortion ban. In a statement President Biden was even clearer [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  saying in part quote there is one person responsible for this nightmare Donald [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=204.2s)]
*  Trump. And in politics people exaggerate all the time but on this it's just true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=207.96s)]
*  There is no question about it. Donald Trump is the man responsible for the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=214.68s)]
*  abortion bans. He's responsible for the bans in Florida and in Arizona and 18 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=218.96s)]
*  other states. He's responsible for every woman that has to suffer awaiting care [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  they desperately need who's turned away. In all the states restricting the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  rights and threatening the lives of millions of Americans. Eliminating the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=232.0s)]
*  federal right to an abortion was Donald Trump's plan from the very beginning. He [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=236.88s)]
*  ran for president the first time on appointing Supreme Court justices that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=240.88s)]
*  would overturn Roe v. Wade. In your selection as president what criteria [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  would you use to pick some of them? Pro-life. They'll be pro-life and we'll [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=251.88s)]
*  see what about overturning but they will be we will appoint I will appoint judges [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=256.88s)]
*  that will be pro-life. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade? Well if we put [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=261.52s)]
*  another two or perhaps three justices on that's really what's going to be that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=265.68s)]
*  will happen and that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=270.12s)]
*  putting pro-life justices on the court. Again there was lots of stuff that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=274.52s)]
*  Donald Trump was real hazy about real foggy about there was a lot of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=279.52s)]
*  misdirection even now this year. There wasn't on this issue. It was clear as [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  day he said it over and over. In fact he even released a list of the anti-abortion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=288.12s)]
*  anti-Road judges he would choose from. The people on that list were chosen by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=294.64s)]
*  conservative groups including the Federalist Society and Heritage [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=298.84s)]
*  Foundation. Now Donald Trump clearly had literally no idea who they were just [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  that they fulfilled the requirements of the anti-abortion far-right. So with the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=306.56s)]
*  judges they were saying well what happens if he appoints the wrong judges [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=312.28s)]
*  and what we did and I just have it we just took a list of judges and I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  thought what I would do is put this forward and this would be the list that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=322.92s)]
*  I would either choose from or pick people very close in terms of the spirit [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=325.8s)]
*  and the meaning of what they represent and I came up with a list the Federalist [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=330.28s)]
*  Society was very much involved various people were involved. It's gotten very [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=336.2s)]
*  good reviews from its immediate release. It's got great reviews the people that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=340.68s)]
*  have seen it have given it so if you want I will yeah I will do it now if you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=344.64s)]
*  can read them I don't I hope your people aren't gonna fall asleep as I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=349.4s)]
*  read them. He read the list of names. I mean this was it again this was a huge [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  issue remember people thought Trump maybe wasn't a stalwart conservative he [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  had skepticism of evangelicals so the idea was just black and white like [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  you're getting the judges and the justices that will overturn wrong. He [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=367.52s)]
*  continued to add to the list and eventually again maybe the only promise [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  the man has kept in his life I honestly mean that he did what he said he [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  chose three names from the list they were all on the list Neil Gorsuch, Brett [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=378.6s)]
*  Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett. Now at their confirmation hearings all three Trump [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=382.8s)]
*  appointees who were on the list who he said would overturn Roe were coy when [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=387.44s)]
*  asked about how they would rule on abortion rights describing Roe as [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  settled law. Roe versus Wade decided in 1973 is oppressed in the United States [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  Supreme Court it has been reaffirmed. I understand the importance of the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=402.32s)]
*  precedent set forth in Roe v Wade. I don't have any agenda I have no agenda [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=408.36s)]
*  to try to overrule Casey I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=414.24s)]
*  decide cases as they come. Amy Coney Barrett got up there under oath and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=419.32s)]
*  turned around and was like I have no agenda to overturn Roe. Sure right of course. Of course Donald Trump's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=426.0s)]
*  aims and his intentions in nominating the three justices were always clear. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=432.6s)]
*  Under my administration we will always defend the very first right in the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=436.96s)]
*  Declaration of Independence and that is the right to life. A tremendous record [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=443.52s)]
*  including two great new Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=450.84s)]
*  Kavanaugh they'll be making tremendous and important decisions on abortion. The [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=455.44s)]
*  president also is opposed to Roe v Wade that's on the ballot as well and the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=461.52s)]
*  court in the court and so that's also at stake right now and so the election is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=466.84s)]
*  all you don't know it's on the ballot why is it in the ballot because because [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=472.2s)]
*  it's not in the ballot it's on the ballot in the court in the court well [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=476.72s)]
*  there's nothing happening there there's nothing happening there Donald Trump [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=481.24s)]
*  2020 nothing happening there the guy who told us all along like you're getting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=486.04s)]
*  Roe v Wade overturned we're getting anti-abortion justices when he gets it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=490.12s)]
*  all there what are you talking about there's nothing happening and then in June of 2022 [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=494.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's six-year-long plot succeeded his three justices who he had [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=498.52s)]
*  vetted who were on the list who he guaranteed would overturn Roe v Wade [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  overturn Roe v Wade eliminating the right to an abortion he brags about it [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=505.8s)]
*  now I want to thank the Supreme Court justices for having the courage Clarence [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=511.04s)]
*  Thomas Samuel Alito John Roberts Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch Amy Coney Barrett [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=518.28s)]
*  for the wisdom and the courage to do this but Donald Trump deserves all the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=526.64s)]
*  credit he is the ultimate cause the man responsible for millions of American [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=532.24s)]
*  women living under dangerous draconian abortion bans and if he's elected again [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=537.12s)]
*  it will only get worse in the spring of 1969 group of students at [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=541.12s)]
*  Morehouse College historically back college in Atlanta were frustrated by [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=546.8s)]
*  what they said was the school's slow progress on civil rights and they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=551.4s)]
*  protested they've been rebuffed so they locked the college trustees in their [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=555.0s)]
*  office for two days and essentially held them hostage now one of the trustees was [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=559.72s)]
*  Martin Luther King senior father of the recently slain civil rights leader he [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=564.8s)]
*  began having chest pains and one of the students later said we let him out of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  there so we wouldn't be accused of murder that student and his classmates [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=574.12s)]
*  eventually gave up under a promise of amnesty from the college the college [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=578.56s)]
*  reneged and he was expelled it would be years before he was rehabilitated [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  decades before he became known the world over as actor Samuel L Jackson now I [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=587.24s)]
*  tell the story for two reasons one to remind us that college activism has long [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=593.4s)]
*  been a part of college education the other reason though is to get a sense of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=597.4s)]
*  proportion which seems lacking today as we watch the disturbing imagery emerged [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=601.12s)]
*  from campuses at Columbia UCLA University of Texas University of South [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=607.36s)]
*  Florida so many others where cops or in some cases mobs took down pro-Palestinian [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=612.6s)]
*  student encampments and protests as well as professors and journalists and just [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=619.64s)]
*  random bystanders the cumulative effect of all this coverage along with some [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=625.64s)]
*  unverified assertions from police and politicians has been to drive home the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=631.36s)]
*  idea that student protests are a basically a terrorist level threat that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=635.64s)]
*  they had to be neutralized by battalions of cops armed like soldiers with M wraps [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=641.08s)]
*  and sonic cannons the reason this seems to me a reaction that's out of proportion [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=645.68s)]
*  to the protest themselves seems especially true when you look at some [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  other campuses like Brown University where administrators negotiated with [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=657.84s)]
*  student protesters who took down their encampment and Wesleyan University [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=661.64s)]
*  whose president said the protesting there was nonviolent and non disruptive [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=665.48s)]
*  adding as long as it continues in this way the university will not attempt to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=669.12s)]
*  clear the encampment now these universities crucially have reiterated [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=672.6s)]
*  their important existing rules against anti-semitic invective and harassment [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  certainly while also protecting assembly which seems sensible also out of step [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=681.08s)]
*  with what you're seeing elsewhere because ever since October 7th when Hamas [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=686.6s)]
*  committed its atrocities in Israel there has been this obsessive media focus on [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=691.52s)]
*  college campuses and that's true partly because there are genuine issues worth [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=696.52s)]
*  debating including the degree which universities are creating spaces that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  are that are hostile to pro-israel Jewish students where they feel under [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  threat or universities the degree to which they're suppressing pro-Palestinian [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  speech and those issues really do matter but the way that so many prominent [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=715.04s)]
*  voices have focused so exclusively on colleges feels honestly a bit decadent [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=721.28s)]
*  to me like we're doing a paper doll version of the conflict because the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  actual reality of what's happening in Gaza is so horrific unceasing and high [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=733.0799999999999s)]
*  stakes it's more enjoyable to argue about what college kids are doing than [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=737.8s)]
*  to confront the human misery and destruction that's happening in the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=742.24s)]
*  actual conflict that is of course the source of these protests what seems most [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=745.76s)]
*  worth debating isn't campus speech but whether the US government should continue [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  to fund and support an Israeli war in Gaza that has pushed more than a million [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=756.68s)]
*  people to the brink of famine a war that has damaged half of the buildings in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=761.04s)]
*  Gaza a war that has failed to bring home most of the hostages held by Hamas that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=764.96s)]
*  has fact and led to the death of some of those hostages as well as the deaths of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  an estimated 34,000 Palestinians including roughly 10,000 women and 13,000 [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=773.92s)]

*  the questionnaire and I can't help but think of the protests that mark the lead [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=795.36s)]
*  up to the Iraq war which were both widely attended and widely attacked and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=799.08s)]
*  many many prominent war supporters including one-time student protester [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  Christopher Hitchens blasted those demonstrations and he pointed to the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=807.84s)]

*  fringe views for instance the view that North Korea is a workers paradise in a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=817.2s)]
*  great place that's a horrible view there were protest organizers with bad views [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=821.24s)]

*  people who thought 9-eleven was an inside job I would argue with them [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=829.76s)]
*  myself at protests did that have anything to do at all with whether the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=833.08s)]

*  where 56 years ago almost to the day student protesters took over the same [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=850.6s)]

*  among other things the universities involvement in the Vietnam War they [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=863.96s)]
*  believe the war was a moral catastrophe and the US should stop waging it they [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=868.24s)]
*  were right and the fact that there were absolutely genuine extremists among [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=872.6s)]
*  those protesters in 68 again had no bearing on whether they were right or [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=877.44s)]
*  not about that what I find particularly maddening about our focus on the [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=881.92s)]
*  conflict is that it's an invasion it avoids the difficult task of being [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPpXHsUhGZQ&t=887.76s)]
