# How Trump’s 2024 primary calendar conflicts with his legal woes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc)
*  Good evening everyone from New York. I'm Eamon Moheideen in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=0.0s)]
*  It has been one week since Donald Trump was indicted for the second time, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=4.5s)]
*  this time over his mishandling of stolen classified documents. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=8.84s)]
*  The ex-president's legal woes are far, far from over. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=13.0s)]
*  And unfortunately for Trump, his calendar as a legal defendant is going to run [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=16.64s)]
*  right up against his calendar as a presidential candidate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=22.0s)]
*  And the first major hurdle is going to come perhaps in just a few weeks from now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  While nothing is set in stone, there has been a great deal of informed speculation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=29.96s)]
*  that Fulton County Georgia District Attorney Fonny Willis could indict Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=34.92s)]
*  for a legal election interference this August. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=38.96s)]
*  Now if she does, that would coincide with the first televised Republican primary debate, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=42.46s)]
*  which is tentatively scheduled for August 23rd in Milwaukee. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Which means it is plausible, if not likely, that Trump's first debate as a 2024 candidate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=51.42s)]
*  will unfold under the shadow of his third criminal indictment this year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=58.82s)]
*  Additionally, the Republican National Committee has already announced a second debate in California. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=64.82s)]
*  And while no date has been set for that event, at least for now, based on previous debate schedules, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=70.06s)]
*  it will likely land somewhere in the fall. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=76.12s)]
*  Right around the time that New York Attorney General Letitia James and her civil fraud suit [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=80.32s)]
*  against the Trump Organization is currently set to go to trial, which is in October. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=85.28s)]
*  And the calendar does not actually get any easier for Donald Trump from then out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=90.12s)]
*  The RNC still has not picked a date for the first in the nation Iowa caucus, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=94.38s)]
*  but it is expected to take place sometime in early January. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=98.28s)]
*  Again, just in time for Trump to start his second civil defamation trial with writer E. Jean Carroll, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=102.44s)]
*  who you may remember, just last month, the ex-president was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=108.72s)]
*  Well, one day after that verdict came out, Trump went on TV and he disparaged Carroll again. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=115.12s)]
*  And those comments will be included in a second defamation suit early next year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=122.62s)]
*  And so that is something that is certain to be front of mind for Iowa voters [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=127.78s)]
*  when that trial begins right at the start of primary season. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=132.08s)]
*  Fast forward. Then in March, amid a flurry of state primaries, including the all-important Super Tuesday, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=137.06s)]
*  Trump is expected to go to trial for his first set of indictments over those illegal hush money payments [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=143.02s)]
*  made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=148.28s)]
*  On top of all of that, there are still a number of unknown factors complicating things for Donald Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=151.28s)]
*  We do not know, for example, when Florida judge Aileen Cannon will set the start of Trump's second criminal trial [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=158.52s)]
*  in the documents case. And even if she does punt that case until, I don't know, after the election, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=165.28s)]
*  like some have speculated she might, it is still entirely possible that special counsel Jack Smith [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=170.82s)]
*  indicts Donald Trump again for the documents, but this time, not for the documents, but this time in New Jersey or in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=176.78s)]
*  Additionally, Jack Smith may still indict Trump on unrelated charges stemming from the January 6 insurrection, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=185.32s)]
*  which makes it all the more ridiculous that the RNC is demanding that the candidates pledge their loyalty [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=193.78s)]
*  to whomever wins the primary, even if that candidate is currently on trial. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=200.18s)]
*  Imagine a loyalty pledge is worth remembering Donald Trump himself for a niggun back in 2016. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=206.18s)]
*  More than six months ago, you pledged to support the Republican nominee, whoever that may be. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=213.44s)]
*  Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=217.84s)]
*  No, I don't anymore. Look, no, we'll see who it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=221.18s)]
*  So the pledge you took is null and void, the idea of supporting whoever the Republican nominee is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  You say you will no longer guarantee that you will support the Republican nominee. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=229.58s)]
*  All right, but this time Trump does not just want his opponents to pledge that they will support him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  He wants them to pledge that they will pardon him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=238.28s)]
*  As Rolling Stone reports, Trump's inner circle has been sending a simple message to other 2024 candidates. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  Promise you will pardon Trump if you are elected or else. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INE6qLC0Rnc&t=248.48000000000002s)]
