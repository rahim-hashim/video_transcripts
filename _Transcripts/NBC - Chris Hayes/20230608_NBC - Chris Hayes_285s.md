# Why Donald Trump was indicted in Florida instead of Washington D.C
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA)
*  No, Chris, on one level, I'm not surprised at all because we have been building to this moment, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=0.0s)]
*  really since last August when we first learned about the FBI's search warrant that authorized [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=6.48s)]
*  them to go to Mar-a-Lago and seize 20-plus boxes of documents despite the representation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=12.32s)]
*  by the former president's lawyers that they had turned over all materials responsive to a subpoena [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=18.56s)]
*  that had been issued by GOJ months and months earlier than that. On the other hand, I'm sitting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=24.4s)]
*  in a hotel room right now in Miami, and if you had asked me where I would be when Donald Trump was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=30.08s)]
*  indicted by the federal government, it certainly wouldn't have been here. As early as early this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=35.44s)]
*  week, we all fully expected that this would happen in Washington, D.C., if at all. The fact that it's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=40.56s)]
*  happening in Miami, and we have all so quickly had to adjust our expectations about where and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=46.4s)]
*  why Miami is part of what has so many people, I think, out there scratching their heads, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=53.36s)]
*  not only about this historic moment, but where exactly it's occurring and why. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=59.36s)]
*  So let's follow up on that. One of the concrete pieces of news we have now, which confirms much [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=64.8s)]
*  of the reporting and has confirmed your court watching in the Miami courthouse where you've [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=69.84s)]
*  seen people coming and going clearly who are relevant to the case, including witnesses and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=74.16s)]
*  Department of Justice officials, is this sort of venue change, right? That this was chugging [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=78.88s)]
*  along in Washington, D.C. It clearly has shifted down to Miami. The president saying he's been [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=83.36s)]
*  summoned, the ex-president saying he's been summoned next Tuesday to Miami. Why? What do we know [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=88.72s)]
*  about when this shift happened to this jurisdiction and why? We don't know a lot, Chris, about when [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=94.8s)]
*  this shift happened. There's been public reporting that indicated that while folks like you and me [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=101.28s)]
*  weren't watching, this grand jury in Miami was convened last month and heard from a variety of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=106.08s)]
*  witnesses before we were here earlier this week to track down Taylor Butowich, Trump's former [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=111.92s)]
*  spokesperson, when he arrived with his lawyer, Stan Woodward. Certainly no public attention was [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=117.6s)]
*  focused on this courtroom or this courthouse, and that may be why the Department of Justice [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=122.64s)]
*  chose Miami over other places, for example, in the Southern District of Florida. But that sort of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=127.68s)]
*  jumps over the predecessor question, which is why Florida at all, right? And Department of Justice [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=133.2s)]
*  policy generally holds that you charge a crime where the bulk of the conduct occurs, and nowhere [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  is that more true than where obstruction is concerned, where there's also some case law in D.C. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  that would trend in that direction. And I think one of the factors for Jack Smith and his team was, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  even though the jury pool in D.C. would have been more favorable to them, and by far, I was on Joy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=156.0s)]
*  Show last night, we talked about the fact that over 90% of those who voted in the 2020 election [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=162.72s)]
*  in the District of Columbia voted for Joe Biden, notwithstanding that, and notwithstanding the fact [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=168.32s)]
*  that the judges on the whole are viewed to be probably more favorable to the special counsel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=173.12s)]
*  you also have to weigh that against the certainty of making the right decision on venue, because if [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=179.52s)]
*  you make the wrong decision and either you get a conviction and it's reversed on appeal, or the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=185.28s)]
*  defendant moves to dismiss the indictment on the basis of erroneous venue, you can't start over. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=191.12s)]
*  There is a real problem there. And Jack Smith is also working against a clock, right? We have Donald [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=197.44s)]
*  Trump, who, while under indictment now, is also a candidate for president of the United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=202.88s)]
*  And the clock for Jack Smith effectively ends on January 20th, 2025, because if Trump is reelected [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=208.88s)]
*  and he takes office, this is game over the minute he takes office, because again, you and I both know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  there's Department of Justice policy that says a sitting president is not subject to criminal [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=222.96s)]
*  process. So he could be mid-suit and mid-case, and he would just declare the whole thing over and done [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=228.0s)]
*  with. And so I think what Jack Smith is really trying to do is maximize the certainty of proceeding [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  to a quick trial rather than one in the most advantageous place you could bring it. He'd [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=240.8s)]
*  rather be in Florida, where, as you and I have discussed many times, the majority of the conduct [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=246.0s)]
*  that's likely at issue here and the indictment we still haven't seen took place in this district, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=251.44s)]
*  aided by a panoply of people favorable to Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLC0Ytc_xfA&t=256.96000000000004s)]
