# Jack Smith seeks to bar Trump from invoking conspiracy theories at Jan. 6 trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA)
*  Good evening from Los Angeles. I'm Jason Johnson and for Chris Hayes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=0.0s)]
*  We're waiting for the special counsel to respond to Donald Trump's wildly expansive claim of presidential immunity [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=4.12s)]
*  Trump says he can't be prosecuted for January 6 because he was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial and he contends that he is quote [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=10.36s)]
*  Absolute immunity from prosecution for his official acts as president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=18.48s)]
*  Jack Smith is expected to respond to those claims before the appeals court [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=22.44s)]
*  Here's arguments on Trump's immunity claims on January 6th [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=26.48s)]
*  All rulings on the January 6th case are currently on hold while that appeals process plays out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=30.0s)]
*  But that didn't stop the special counsel from filing a new motion with Judge Chanya Chutkin today [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=35.2s)]
*  Asking the court to not allow quote the defendant to turn the courtroom into a forum in which he propagates irrelevant [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=41.44s)]
*  Disinformation and should reject his attempt to inject politics into this proceeding [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=48.92s)]
*  Smith also wants the court to quote [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=53.44s)]
*  Prohibit the defendant from introducing evidence making arguments or framing questions to advance a theory of selective or vindictive [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=56.12s)]
*  prosecution [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=64.2s)]
*  basically special counsel wants to make sure Trump can't say this is Joe Biden's DOJ targeting him and in response [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=66.0s)]
*  Trump said Joe Biden's DOJ is targeting him a rant by the ex-president called Jack Smith crooked [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=73.12s)]
*  Joe Biden's errand boy and a campaign email that went out just hours after the filing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=78.84s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is Ryan Reilly justice reporter for NBC News and author of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=84.08s)]
*  Sedition hunters how January 6 broke the justice system Ryan. Thanks so much for joining me this evening. Look, I have to start with this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=89.28s)]
*  So one part of the ruling we're waiting to hear [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  Jacksmith is basically laying out to judge Chutkin. I don't want Trump to do the thing that we know that Trump is going to do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=102.52s)]
*  Is this working the refs is this sort of saying hey [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Hey, you know that you know that Shaq is gonna spend more than three seconds in the key [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=113.64s)]
*  Is he working the refs here or does he actually think that judge Chutkin is going to be able to stop Trump from doing? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=117.36s)]
*  The thing that he always does [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=122.84s)]
*  Hey Jason, you know [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=125.44s)]
*  I think that this has happened in case after case before with other January 6th defendants where they've tried to bring up these sort of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=126.48s)]
*  irrelevant [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=132.6s)]
*  Charges that aren't based in any fact or reality about the FBI sort of setting up January 6 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  This notion that the FBI was controlling these figures behind the scenes who were directing these Trump supporters to do these terrible things [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=140.36s)]
*  And oh what lo and behold I got I got caught and did something I wasn't supposed to do [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know it I think it sort of speaks to the failure of the January 6 committee in some respects [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=152.44s)]
*  Because the January 6 committee didn't end up focusing a lot on the FBI failures that lead up to January [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=157.32s)]
*  Let up to January 6 and because of that you have a lot of people who are willing to sort of accept these these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=162.64s)]
*  bizarre conspiracy theories that all lean on this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=168.55999999999997s)]
*  idea that the FBI is extremely competent and was pulling these things behind the scenes when in reality [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=171.76s)]
*  There were just a bunch of failures that led up to January 6 and what happened is a bunch of Trump supporters thought that the election [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=176.72s)]
*  Was stolen and stormed the Capitol what happened is pretty simple [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=182.72s)]
*  But they're trying to bring in all of these other facts around it and trying to or other [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=186.04s)]
*  Disinformation around it and trying to pretend like there's some grander conspiracy here that the FBI is all behind it having read through thousands of pages [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=190.88s)]
*  Of FBI emails, I mean it should be ridiculous on its face [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=197.68s)]
*  But once you read these emails and see how many problems there were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=201.44s)]
*  There were from the FBI and the lead-up to January 6 it really starts to seem absolutely ridiculous [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=204.72s)]
*  It's always interesting to me Ryan that that anti-government conspiracy theorists think the government is terrible and competent [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=210.8s)]
*  until it suits their conspiracy theory and then suddenly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=217.12s)]
*  They're all geniuses and all able to do everything that they want them to do [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=220.4s)]
*  Speaking of this, I think this conspiracy is key and the smith filing he talks about this idea of undercover agents [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=223.52s)]
*  And he says look we don't want to allow defendants to introduce evidence about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=229.12s)]
*  Undercover actors because that would inevitably lead to confusing many trials on collateral issues [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Such as the identities and intentions of the alleged undercover actors [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=238.72s)]
*  For example [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=241.76s)]
*  It may require the government to introduce evidence to show that people whom the defendant alleges were undercover actuaries [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=242.56s)]
*  Were actually his vehement supporters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=248.56s)]
*  Ryan you've written about this and I I find this to be one of the most critical elements of any prosecution about trump on january 6 [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=251.36s)]
*  How can we stop that from happening? How can you prove a negative? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=259.52s)]
*  Because trump supporters as you sort of pointed out have long pushed this theory that this is all this sort of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=263.04s)]
*  Scooby-doo conspiracy theory that if you pull off the mask it was antifo [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=267.92s)]
*  But if you pull off the other mask is the trump supporter, but that person is innocent. How do you stop that in court? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=271.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's almost comical but it does become this big distraction and this big time waster [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  Um, there's a recent case and I wrote about this last week [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=281.36s)]
*  But there's been even a more recent case since my piece last week involving someone that people alleged were [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=283.92s)]
*  Was a antifa supporter who ended up? Oh lo and behold just to be a trump supporter [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=289.92s)]
*  But it's happened time and time again [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  One of the sort of most hilarious examples to me is that there's an individual [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=295.2s)]
*  Who two people on the very day of there were two people dressed in black and people were yelling in the crowd at that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=300.56s)]
*  Moment getting sucked into these conspiracies there. He's saying they're antifa. They're antifa [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=305.68s)]
*  What was that based on basically if you're wearing black or if you're smashing windows you were automatically assumed to be antifa, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=309.68s)]
*  There was not like a deep inquiry into the political ideology of the individuals smashing the windows at the time [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=316.0s)]
*  It was just like oh they have to be antifa [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=321.68s)]
*  And then lo and behold one of them was guy who went around to trump rallies was one of the quote-unquote [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  Front row joes who went to trump rallies because he he went around the country got in line [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  It was one of the first people in line for a lot of trump rallies the other individual was actually just arrested more recently [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=333.76s)]
*  And he's also a deep trump supporter [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=340.0s)]
*  I went back and scrolled through his facebook page back in 2020 and you know [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=341.68s)]
*  It's pro-trump meme after pro-trump meme anti-biden meme after anti-biden meme [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=346.08s)]
*  And then there's the fact of course that he tried to storm the capital after donald trump said you have to fight like hell [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=350.4s)]
*  So it just happens time and time again where there's supposed to be this next mystery under the you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=355.92s)]
*  It's going to be under the next door and they just fail over and over and over again [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=360.8s)]
*  But at some point it kind of gets into the you know [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=364.64s)]
*  A lot of people start to believe it and a lot of trump supporters really do believe that this was some undercover antifa operation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=367.2s)]
*  And so donald trump would if he has the opportunity to take advantage of that to any extent that he could [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=373.2s)]
*  Ron reilly, thank you so much for starting us off this evening [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=379.76s)]
*  You [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5s20HE8FA&t=390.8s)]
