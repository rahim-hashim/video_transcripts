# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g)
*  In the final words of the 45 page criminal indictment of Donald Trump, prosecutor Jack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=0.0s)]
*  Smith ends the document with the fourth charge against the ex-president, conspiracy against [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=4.16s)]
*  rights. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=9.24s)]
*  Quote, defendant Donald J. Trump did knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=10.24s)]
*  with co-conspirators, known and unknown to the grand jury, to injure, oppress, threaten, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=15.24s)]
*  and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=19.56s)]
*  privilege secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=23.8s)]
*  That is the right to vote and to have one's vote counted. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=27.7s)]
*  Donald Trump is the first president to be charged with section of 241 of Title 18, the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=31.7s)]
*  U.S. Code, but he's far from the first person charged with it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=36.1s)]
*  Now the section number probably doesn't mean much to anyone, but it is from the first series [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=39.62s)]
*  of Reconstruction Era acts known as the Ku Klux Klan Acts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=45.78s)]
*  Some of the first charges brought under this law were over 100 years ago against two elections [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=50.94s)]
*  board officials in Blaine County, Oklahoma. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=56.06s)]
*  The men were part of a three-person board and during the 1912 election, they engaged [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=59.06s)]
*  a conspiracy that, quote, left out of their official canvas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  All the votes from 11 precincts were the grandfather clause. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=67.5s)]
*  A Jim Crow-era law to disenfranchise black citizens had not been zealously enforced. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  The result was to drop some 1,200 votes, mainly cast by black and native citizens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=75.94s)]
*  The conspiracy led to a narrow loss by a House candidate who should have rightfully won. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=82.74s)]
*  The law has been used to punish all kinds of intimidation since then, according to the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=88.58s)]
*  Washington Post, including to prosecute members of the KKK who carried out the 1964 Freedom [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=91.58s)]
*  Summer Murders, as well as the 1999 indictment of a KKK member who oversaw the burning of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=96.82s)]
*  a cross in the front yard of a Puerto Rican man and his Mexican wife. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=102.14s)]
*  There's even someone waiting to be sentenced under the statute this fall. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=105.58s)]
*  In March, a Trump supporter named Douglas Mackey was convicted of using Twitter to disenfranchise [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=108.94s)]
*  voters in the 2016 election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=114.86s)]
*  With the help of Russian troll farm, Mackey spread misinformation about voting, posting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=117.58s)]
*  tweets like this one, targeting people of color who supported Hillary Clinton falsely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=122.34s)]
*  claiming they could vote by text message. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=127.3s)]
*  He's awaiting sentencing, that guy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=130.1s)]
*  The circumstance that we find ourselves in today, with an ex-president joining that list [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=132.38s)]
*  of people charged under 18 USC Section 241, is on the one hand unprecedented in the defendant's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=135.64s)]
*  level of power, the breadth of the offense, and on the other hand, firmly rooted in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=141.92s)]
*  ugliest and oldest American tradition, the opposition by any means necessary to the promise [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=146.48s)]
*  of full multiracial democratic equality. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=151.55999999999997s)]
*  Much of the foundation of the third criminal indictment against Donald Trump comes from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=156.2s)]
*  the extensive and painstaking work of the January 6th Committee. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  A bipartisan panel was formed in the summer of 2021, spent nearly 18 months investigating [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=163.48s)]
*  the insurrection, the plot to steal the 2020 election. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=168.28s)]
*  The committee presented its findings in 10 public hearings last year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=171.0s)]
*  In December, it released an extensive 845 page report which gave prosecutors a roadmap [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=174.28s)]
*  to continue chasing leads and calling witnesses. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=180.04s)]
*  Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin served on the January 6th Select Committee [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=182.76s)]
*  and is a professor of constitutional law, and he joins me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  It's good to have you Congressman. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=191.12s)]
*  Let me ask you to begin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=192.12s)]
*  How you conceive of the relationship between the committee's work and the Department of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Justice and Jack Smith's indictment? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=200.08s)]
*  Well, we created with a legislative oversight committee a factual reconstruction of the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  events leading up to January 6th and a description of Donald Trump's multi-pronged assault on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=216.72s)]
*  American constitutional democracy and attempt to overthrow the election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=222.6s)]
*  And then that factual framework with the referral of four criminal charges that we synthesized [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=226.44s)]
*  it down to became the basis, at least theoretically, for the beginning of their work. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=234.36s)]
*  Now, I know a lot of it had started before that, but I think it did help to structure [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=241.96s)]
*  their investigation and their thinking about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=247.84s)]
*  And at the very least, it prepared all Americans for what was to come because a lot of time [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=250.8s)]
*  has lapsed between now and January 6th, 2021. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=257.8s)]
*  And that period could have been filled up with a lot of propaganda and disinformation [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=262.8s)]
*  by forces. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=267.8s)]
*  But we told a story that penetrated the national consciousness and I think got people ready [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=269.68s)]
*  for these very dramatic charges which are completely fitting Donald Trump's crimes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  You're someone who you're a constitutional scholar and I think you think a lot, I think, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=282.88s)]
*  about the sort of nation's second founding, the Reconstruction era amendments, the 13th, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  14th, and 15th amendments and the laws associated with that time and have cited Lincoln particularly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=295.64s)]
*  quite a bit and Lincoln's thoughts about insurrection because that, of course, is what he was facing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=302.2s)]
*  How were you surprised or what was your reaction to seeing that one of the indictments is a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=308.24s)]
*  conspiracy to deny Americans rights under those Reconstruction laws? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=315.24s)]
*  Well, it was thrilling because that count goes right to the heart of what was actually [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  taking place. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, Lincoln said it best where he said that an insurrection fundamentally [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  is an assault on the very first principle of democratic government, which is that the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  people get to choose their own leaders. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=340.11999999999995s)]
*  And there are lots of ways to steal an election. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  You can steal it with literacy tests, with poll taxes, with grandfather clauses, with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=344.44s)]
*  terrorist violence or by stealing the ballot boxes, throwing people's ballots away or [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=350.2s)]
*  engaging in all of the different kinds of shenanigans that Donald Trump did leading up [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=358.4s)]
*  to January 6. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=365.4s)]
*  And there are people who've gone to jail for that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, it's shocking to me that they think somehow they have a free speech right [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=369.68s)]
*  to engage in a violent insurrection or a political coup against American constitutional process. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  One of the criticisms that was levied against your committee was that it was insufficiently [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  adversarial. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, I'll say that's just because Kevin McCarthy decided not to appoint members. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  When Nancy Pelosi rejected a few of the original proposed members, he just sort of took a small [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=397.84s)]
*  one home. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=402.64s)]
*  Instead, there were other Republicans appointed, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, quite famously. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=404.0s)]
*  This will be an adversarial process. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  And do you think that's good? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=410.96s)]
*  How do you conceive of the import of this trial and also the president mounting a defense? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=414.76s)]
*  Well, yes, I mean, of course, all of this is within the American rule of law and our [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=420.36s)]
*  system of justice. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  So Donald Trump starts off with the presumption of innocence. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=429.0s)]
*  He has every right of due process. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=432.44s)]
*  He's got a judge, Judge Shetkin, who was herself a public defender and a criminal defense lawyer [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=434.44s)]
*  who's extremely attentive to the rights of criminal defendants, but also understands [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=441.44s)]
*  that our Constitution has at least six different provisions that explicitly oppose insurrection [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=447.44s)]
*  and attempts to overthrow our government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=454.44s)]
*  She's really the perfect judge for this case. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=457.84s)]
*  And, you know, this is where the case ultimately belongs. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=460.84s)]
*  But we played a very important purpose in terms of public education about what happened [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=465.84s)]
*  to us. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=471.84s)]
*  And it takes a village, a nationwide village, to deal with an attack like we saw on January 6. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=472.84s)]
*  Do you think that the average voter, American, understands just how close it all came? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=478.84s)]
*  I do think there's a little bit of, you know, even people who don't like Donald Trump, he's sort of a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  ridiculous figure, but just the narrowness of the margin by which the American Constitutional Republic [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=492.23999999999995s)]
*  was preserved. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  Do you think people get that? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, if Mike Pence had caved in to all of the pressure and decided to step outside of his [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  role and just proclaim Donald Trump to be the new president or unilaterally nullified electoral [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=511.64s)]
*  college votes as Trump and his people were egging him on to do, that would have changed everything. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=519.64s)]
*  If, you know, half of the police force had just walked off in despair, which they didn't, they were [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=525.64s)]
*  bloodied and wounded, but they fought until the very end, it would have changed everything. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=532.64s)]
*  So we came extremely close, as close as we should ever come in our lifetimes. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=536.64s)]
*  Congressman Jimmy Raskin, always a pleasure. Thank you, sir. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1-Y50T-t4g&t=540.64s)]
