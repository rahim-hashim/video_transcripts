# AOC: Supreme Court is ‘paving the path to authoritarianism’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w)
*  So we are faced with an increasingly urgent question. What can be done about this out-of-control court? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=0.0s)]
*  Today Democrats in the House Oversight Committee held a roundtable on the ethical crisis in the Supreme Court. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=6.0s)]
*  I should note that one of the expert legal witnesses there was my wife Kate Shaw. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Leading that panel was Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=15.68s)]
*  the vice ranking member, and they both join me now. It's good to have you on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=22.96s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=26.42s)]
*  Congressman, I'll start with you just about what the agenda was today to convene this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=28.42s)]
*  Obviously you can't call hearings yourself as a ranking member and not the chair, but what were you trying to do today? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=33.42s)]
*  Well, the Oversight Democrats wanted to respond to the national clamor over this crisis of legitimacy at the Supreme Court, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=40.42s)]
*  and so we analyzed the ethics crisis, we analyzed the political crisis around confirmations that got us into this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=50.42s)]
*  and the blockaded confirmations of people like Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama to the court, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=59.42s)]
*  and then we began to talk about what sorts of things could be done, both in the specific case of Justices Alito and Thomas, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=66.42s)]
*  and then generally about the ethical collapse at the Supreme Court. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=73.42s)]
*  It's the highest court in the land with the lowest ethical standards. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=77.42s)]
*  These are the only governmental officials in the land who are not governed by a binding ethics code. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=81.42s)]
*  There's no process by which we can hold any of them accountable, and so it violates the essential principle [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=89.42s)]
*  that James Madison identified as the heart of our justice system, which is that no man can be a judge in his own cause, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=95.42s)]
*  so we began to explore different avenues of holding them accountable. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=102.42s)]
*  Yeah, Congresswoman, you said something towards the end of the hearing just saying that it just cannot be the case [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=107.42s)]
*  as sort of a constitutional matter, as an almost intuitive common sense matter, that they are not subject to any checks, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=113.42s)]
*  We have three co-equal branches, there's checks and balances that move between the three directions, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=120.42s)]
*  and the position which Justice Alito has actually taken on the record, he actually said in a Wall Street Journal interview [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=125.42s)]
*  that Congress has no ability to regulate us whatsoever. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=130.42s)]
*  What should Congress be doing? What are you brainstorming basically? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=134.42s)]
*  What's the conversation about what those checks can be? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=139.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, of course Justice Alito's position is laughable in this, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=143.42s)]
*  this idea that he can be and that the court should be accountable to nobody, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=149.42s)]
*  and that the only person that they should be accountable to are themselves, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=154.42s)]
*  this kind of scout's promise sort of set up for how we should be having ethics standards [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=159.42s)]
*  for the most, the highest and most consequential court in the land. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=166.42s)]
*  It is completely unacceptable, and not only is it unacceptable, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=170.42s)]
*  but to have any one of our co-equal branches be completely unaccountable to the others [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=173.42s)]
*  is paving the path to authoritarianism, tyranny, the abuse of power in the United States, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=179.42s)]
*  and it is structurally completely unsustainable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=186.42s)]
*  And so it is not a question on if Congress has jurisdiction and power over the Supreme Court, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=190.42s)]
*  it is what power are we going to exercise in order to rein in a fundamentally unaccountable and rogue court. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=197.42s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things about today's roundtable is that we were able to also call in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=206.42s)]
*  one of our Senate colleagues, Senator Whitehouse, who has been pursuing extensive investigations [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=211.42s)]
*  into the dark money network that has been exerting influence over the court. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=216.42s)]
*  And we raised and discussed a varying degree of measures from term limits to an actual binding ethics standard, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=220.42s)]
*  and also Congressman Raskin and myself will be introducing forthcoming legislation [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=227.42s)]
*  to even have the Supreme Court be subject to the same $50 gift rule that he and I are subject to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=232.42s)]
*  as everyone else, as members of Congress. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=238.42s)]
*  Yeah, that is a great point. I mean, my understanding, I was talking to my wife, Kate Shaw, about this the other night, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=241.42s)]
*  who gave testimony the day before your hearing, and she pointed out to me that, if I'm not mistaken, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=247.42s)]
*  that things like, for instance, you can get a book deal as a Supreme Court justice, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=254.42s)]
*  That's allowed. But you couldn't, like, be a partner Wilmer Hale, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=258.42s)]
*  Like, you clearly couldn't, like, and that's something that Congress passed a statute to say that you, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=263.42s)]
*  what you couldn't, couldn't do, because obviously it would be nuts to be a Supreme Court justice [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=269.42s)]
*  and have a side gig as a lawyer. Like, we all understand that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=273.42s)]
*  Presumably, Congressman Raskin, like, you can change, like, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=276.42s)]
*  Congress can pass statutes that say this activity is just not allowed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=279.42s)]
*  I mean, Congress has a ban on outside employment, and as AOC was saying, we have a $50 gift ban, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=284.42s)]
*  so none of us goes anywhere near doing that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=291.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you don't do $500,000 vacations for free? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=294.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the comical thing. I mean, members of Congress don't even understand that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=298.42s)]
*  Under what circumstances would a Supreme Court justice be accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=302.42s)]
*  or millions of dollars in foreign travel or paid tuition for family members or a recreational vehicle, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=308.42s)]
*  motor stagecoach? It's just outlandish for us to contemplate. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=316.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's like a jailable offense for people over here, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=321.42s)]
*  and it's just like the normal business as usual at the Supreme Court [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=325.42s)]
*  that they're collecting millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars from their so-called friends. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=330.42s)]
*  And so we need to clean that up, and that's why, you know, we said we're going to start with something simple [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=335.42s)]
*  that the whole country will be able to understand immediately and intuitively. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=340.42s)]
*  We want a $50 gift ban for U.S. Supreme Court justices. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=344.42s)]
*  They make $300,000 a year, pay for your own lunch, and pay for your own vacation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=348.42s)]
*  Yeah, that does seem quite clear, Congresswoman, and also has the advantage, again, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=353.42s)]
*  there's particular issues to deal with the members of this court, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=359.42s)]
*  but in some ways the only way to legislate it or for Congress to act is outlaying some broad principles that are equally applicable. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=362.42s)]
*  Absolutely, and as all of us as public servants and federal public servants, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=370.42s)]
*  whether it is both chambers of Congress, whether it is the White House, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=376.42s)]
*  many of us are subject to the same, if not extremely similar, and uniform code of ethics. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=381.42s)]
*  And the fact that the Supreme Court, which is already unelected, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=387.42s)]
*  at least for those of us who run for office, we have to rerun for office every two years here in the House, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=392.42s)]
*  for an unelected body of nine people appointed for life [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=398.42s)]
*  to not have any sort of binding, strict ethics code to which they can not only be held accountable, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=404.42s)]
*  but which can be enforced is actually ludicrous. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=413.42s)]
*  And it's almost unbelievable that we are sitting here in the year 2024, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=417.42s)]
*  over 200 years after the establishment of this country, and that we actually have not addressed this issue. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=423.42s)]
*  It is something that is long past doing, and it's common sense. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=429.42s)]
*  One of the things that we addressed, Chris, was how the private corruption of the justices mirrors the public corruption of justice. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=433.42s)]
*  And it is this Roberts Court, this right-wing corporate court, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=441.42s)]
*  which has been dismantling civil rights law, civil liberties, women's right to choose an abortion, labor law, consumer law, you name it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=445.42s)]
*  So as they grow more and more removed from the experiences of the way the rest of us live, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=454.42s)]
*  the more they're willing to just demolish the protections the rest of us need. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=460.42s)]
*  There's a bunch of things that happened today outside of the purview of this question of the court [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=464.42s)]
*  that do have to do with sort of equal justice under law, and I wonder if both of you would stick around to talk about that. Is that all right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=470.42s)]
*  Love to. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=476.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=477.42s)]
*  Great. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6H-RoVp1w&t=478.42s)]
