# ‘Spectacular embarrassment’: GOP's ‘informant’ charged with lying about Bidens
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU)
*  We begin with another case, and that's the one that Republicans have drummed up against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden's only living son. For years, the right wing has been running a sketchy, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=4.4s)]
*  tawdry political operation to find and prosecute any wrongdoing by the president's son, Hunter Biden. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=11.52s)]
*  And the president's son has, of course, as we all know, made some very bad judgment calls over the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=17.68s)]
*  years, largely, I think, related to his lifelong struggle with addiction. But he has been targeted [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=22.8s)]
*  in what is essentially a political hit job intended to inflict pain upon his father. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=28.96s)]
*  He is facing criminal charges by a special prosecutor in the Department of Justice that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=35.68s)]
*  many experts say would never be brought against anyone who is not the son of the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, some of the most serious claims leveled against Hunter Biden have to do with his work [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=46.16s)]
*  for a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma and alleged payments they made to the Bidens. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Plural. You see, Republicans have been yelling from the rooftops about Burisma and alleged [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  bribes paid not only to Hunter Biden, but to Joe Biden, to the man himself, the president of the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  United States who was then vice president. That idea of illicit, secret, seven-figure bribes to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=66.72s)]
*  the man who's currently president has been the central point of their whole attack. And today, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=73.68s)]
*  in the most spectacular embarrassment unmanageable, it blew up in their faces. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=79.04s)]
*  You see, the special counsel, Republican appointee, leading the case against Hunter Biden, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  who was appointed by Donald Trump, now says that that guy, this informant they hung their entire [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=90.0s)]
*  claim on about the bribe, he lied. Their infamous FBI informant is being federally, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=96.16s)]
*  criminally charged for making it all up. Documented allegations of bribery from a trusted FBI [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=104.24s)]
*  confidential human source has now finally been released. Now its contents are devastating. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=113.36s)]
*  Okay, I am sparing you the amount of Sean Hannity I could play you. For my sins, I watched about 30 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=119.92s)]
*  minutes of monologues. But in his show, Fox host Sean Hannity alone promoted the claim of this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=125.76s)]
*  single FBI informant no less than 85 times last year. 28 of those segments were monologues, very [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=132.64s)]
*  long monologues, in addition to all the breathless so-called reporting. And this is across the right [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=140.16s)]
*  wing media. Hannity had House Oversight Committee Chairman and Chief Biden Crime Family Investigator [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  James Comer on as a guest 43 times in 2023. Today, James Comer and Sean Hannity's favorite [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=151.68s)]
*  informant, the smoking gun to their investigation, was arrested at Harry Reid International Airport [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=158.72s)]
*  in Las Vegas. He was indicted on two counts of feeding the FBI false information about President [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=164.32s)]
*  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. According to that indictment, 43-year-old Alexander Smirnov's story [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=171.6s)]
*  about Burisma officials paying the Bidens million quote was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=177.84s)]
*  unremarkable business meetings and contacts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rmBrkUTLU&t=194.32s)]
