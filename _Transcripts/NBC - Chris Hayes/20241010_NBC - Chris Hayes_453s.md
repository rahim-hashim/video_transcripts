# Buttigieg praises ‘responsible leaders’ working to debunk hurricane misinformation
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A)
*  Last hour, President Barack Obama reminded voters in Pennsylvania just how important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=0.0s)]
*  good governance is in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=4.5s)]
*  Tonight, the Southeast is dealing with the fallout of that storm. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=7.7s)]
*  That's the second major hurricane to hit the region in just two weeks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=10.46s)]
*  Earlier today in the White House Situation Room, President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  met with the team managing the federal response. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=17.18s)]
*  Biden assured the American people, quote, my administration was on the ground to prepare [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=19.98s)]
*  for the storm. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=23.06s)]
*  We will stay for as long as it takes to respond, recover, and rebuild. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Joining me now is the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  He was at the Federal Emergency Management Agency's headquarters earlier today, getting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=30.68s)]
*  the latest updates from personnel on the ground responding to Hurricane Milton. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=34.6s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, it's good to have you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=37.8s)]
*  First, I guess, if you just tell us, how are things looking, what the sort of read that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=39.92s)]
*  you got today at FEMA from the aftermath of Milton? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, certainly, this is a devastating storm. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  More than a dozen people have lost their lives. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=51.92s)]
*  At the same time, some of the worst-case scenarios that we feared yesterday evening did not come [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=54.64s)]
*  to pass. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=60.28s)]
*  There's extraordinary teamwork on the ground. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=61.76s)]
*  I saw personnel from so many different agencies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=64.08s)]
*  I lost count working together in a very disciplined and coordinated way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=67.16s)]
*  The ones I saw at FEMA headquarters today, and then there are so many personnel on the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=72.52s)]
*  ground. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=76.24s)]
*  You know, between the two storm operations, more than 8,000 federal personnel, several [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=77.24s)]
*  hundred just from my department alone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=82.54s)]
*  That teamwork is leading to results, and of course, most importantly, getting people the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  immediate aid they need and getting on that path toward normalcy, toward recovery, that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=89.64s)]
*  we know it's going to take a while to get there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  Something I've noticed in our politics and information environment over the last several [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=97.86s)]
*  years is that it's easier to sort of subscribe to nutty conspiracy theories the further something [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=100.98s)]
*  is from you, but when it's closer, often that goes away, particularly for elected members. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  You've got a situation like this where, as far as I can tell, all that nutty disinformation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=111.66s)]
*  and really toxic and insidious disinformation that was flowing went away when you had local [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=116.58s)]
*  officials across the political spectrum in Florida saying, this is serious, please evacuate, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=123.66s)]
*  please get to a shelter. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=129.22s)]
*  And it looks like that part of it worked, but it also speaks to how important that is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=130.74s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=136.74s)]
*  You know, I've been really struck by how, as I've spoken to mayors as well as governors, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=137.74s)]
*  both in the context of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, senators, obviously from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=143.56s)]
*  both parties, and the partisanship really falls away. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=149.0s)]
*  You wouldn't know from my conversations with these leaders which ones belong to the same [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=152.24s)]
*  political party I did and which belong to the other party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=156.12s)]
*  I will say also, I think because the misinformation going around Hurricane Helene was so disturbing, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  and the president took it head on, I think a lot of responsible leaders in both parties [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=166.38s)]
*  and in the press took that on, there was less of it in the context of Milton. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=171.5s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, I'm concerned about misinformation around both storms. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=177.1s)]
*  But I'm very thankful that as local officials were saying to evacuate, and we were seeking [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=181.82s)]
*  to amplify that message yesterday, and then as the message evolved from evacuate to when [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=187.5s)]
*  it was too late for that and the message became more one about shelter in place, people listened [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=192.4s)]
*  to those messages. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think people heeding that warning and evacuating is part of the reason why we didn't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  have much more loss of life than we did in the case of Milton's landfall. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=202.88s)]
*  You've got a sort of remarkable situation with the FEMA budget now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=208.04s)]
*  Obviously FEMA is funded for emergency disasters, but obviously these two disasters back to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=211.4s)]
*  back will drain some of that money. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=216.2s)]
*  There's going to be a need for additional funding and a sort of tug of war happening [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=219.62s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. in which the House Republican speaker doesn't want to call people back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=224.26s)]
*  They're also fielding calls because lots of people who subscribe to that misinformation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=230.9s)]
*  have been told that it's all been spent on immigrants falsely, want them to come back [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  to Washington. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=237.66s)]
*  How do you see that shaking out? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=238.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we're facing a comparable issue just within the Department of Transportation's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=240.66s)]
*  emergency relief budget. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=246.7s)]
*  Over the weekend, we pushed the first $100 million to North Carolina, $32 million to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=248.6s)]
*  Tennessee and requests from South Carolina and Georgia in the single digit millions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=253.28s)]
*  We've got under $200 million left in that account. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=258.28s)]
*  Now that's going to be enough to address the immediate needs and short-term requests that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=261.48s)]
*  come in. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=265.2s)]
*  But it's very clear that we're not going to be able to meet all of the needs that we can [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=266.2s)]
*  see coming in the months and years ahead without some help from Congress. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=269.8s)]
*  And I know that's happening in many different parts of the federal response. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, my hope and expectation would be that when Congress takes this up, it will be bipartisan [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=277.26s)]
*  and it will be something that lays politics aside. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=283.58s)]
*  I know there have been some struggles in the past. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=286.74s)]
*  Sometimes congressional Republicans have not been as eager to replenish some of those accounts. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=289.06s)]
*  But right now, I think, is a time when we can get some good bipartisan cooperation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=295.3s)]
*  That's certainly going to be the spirit that we approach things with when Congress comes back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=299.42s)]
*  You mentioned that money from North Carolina. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=304.18s)]
*  One of the things that's been really so disruptive and so traumatic there is the destruction [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  of the infrastructure, particularly the transportation infrastructure. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  Reading stories of people that had to sort of cut their way out of the woods five or [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=315.12s)]
*  six miles, driving ATVs to places, being reached with drone or helicopter because roads are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=318.6s)]
*  washed out. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=323.92s)]
*  How long is it going to take and what is the federal government doing to get people to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=325.72s)]
*  be able to just traverse large areas of western North Carolina? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=329.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's difficult to even describe, but the numbers may help a little bit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=335.88s)]
*  We've been working with the North Carolina DOT, and just to give you a sense of what [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  they're up against, they have identified 6,000 of what they call damage sites, 6,000 different [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  locations where there has been damage to roads and infrastructure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=349.44s)]
*  There are more than 631 closures that are being tracked. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=354.76s)]
*  That's everything from closures along major interstates to small rural roads that are [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=358.24s)]
*  critically important to the communities that count on them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=364.38s)]
*  North Carolina's DOT estimates more than 100 bridges are going to need to be replaced. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=366.94s)]
*  So of course, the focus right now is to make sure that there is immediate relief and support [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=373.06s)]
*  just to get aid and responders into where they need to be, things like the debris removal, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  but also preparing for that long term. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=382.66s)]
*  Obviously, when you're dealing with devastation at that scale, this work is going to go into [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=384.46000000000004s)]
*  next year and potentially beyond before things are truly fully restored and back to normal, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  which is part of why we know it's going to require a lot of funding and just a ton of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=395.44s)]
*  coordination. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  In addition to funding, we're providing technical assistance, every kind of support that we [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  can offer from the federal side. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=404.36s)]
*  And it's just amazing in North Carolina, Tennessee, and other states, and now also in Florida [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  on the ground, what those state DOTs are doing, what those local officials are doing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=411.12s)]
*  We're making sure they get all the support we can give them. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=415.62s)]
*  And that's something that the president has promised and has made clear to every agency [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=418.22s)]
*  in this administration that he expects, is that we will be with these communities for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=422.72s)]
*  as long as it takes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=427.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=428.74s)]
*  Secretary Pete Buttigieg, thank you very much for making some time for us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=429.74s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=432.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Q3WiHkL2A&t=448.12s)]
