# ‘Make them riot’: Jack Smith coup bombshell reveals damning evidence against Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Just 34 days out from the election, voting's already [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=0.0s)]
*  started in a number of states. The judge in Donald Trump's January 6th special counsel case has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=4.8s)]
*  unsealed a new court filing just this afternoon. In the filing, special counsel Jack Smith outlines [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=9.84s)]
*  with new details why Donald Trump should be federally prosecuted for his attempted coup. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=16.0s)]
*  And so we have a special show tonight. I'm going to be joined in just a moment by Rachel Maddow [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=22.48s)]
*  and Lawrence O'Donnell. You see them both there through the magic of television. They're going to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=25.92s)]
*  help me break down the breaking news this evening. Now the filing is 165 pages long, roughly half of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=29.28s)]
*  which made up of an entirely new summary of the case. As prosecutors put it, when Trump lost the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=35.2s)]
*  2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office. With private co-conspirators, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=41.36s)]
*  the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn legitimate election [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=48.64s)]
*  results in seven states that he had lost. Smith's office also explains why Donald Trump was not acting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=53.36s)]
*  in an official capacity as president when he schemed to steal the 2020 election. Now that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=60.08s)]
*  distinction, obviously very important in light of this summer's ruling by the Supreme Court, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=66.08s)]
*  which basically said the president United States is kind of above the law. He or she can act with impunity [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=70.64s)]
*  like a dictator, a king, as long as whatever they do can be justified as an official act [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=77.04s)]
*  of the office of the president. And that is why Jack Smith argues that Trump was acting as a candidate, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=83.84s)]
*  as a private citizen fundamentally, a candidate for office when he tried to overturn the election [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=90.0s)]
*  and therefore should still be eligible for prosecution. The special counsel's office writes, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Although Trump was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  his scheme was fundamentally a private one. Working with a team of private co-conspirators, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=105.44s)]
*  Trump acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt through fraud and deceit [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=112.0s)]
*  the government function by which votes are collected and counted, a function in which the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=117.36s)]
*  defendant as president had no official role. Smith also provides multiple new anecdotes from Trump's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=121.52s)]
*  campaign inner circle, outlining what prosecutors say was this willful scheme to defraud the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=130.48s)]
*  American people. In the immediate post-election period, while Trump claimed fraud without proof, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  his private operatives sought to create chaos rather than seek clarity at polling places where [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=140.72s)]
*  states were continuing to tabulate votes. For example, on November 4, someone identified as [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=145.76s)]
*  Person 5, a campaign employee, agent, and co-conspirator of the defendant, tried to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=150.88s)]
*  sow confusion when the ongoing vote count at the TCF Center in Detroit, Michigan looked unfavorable [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=156.4s)]
*  to Trump. There, when a colleague at the TCF Center told Person 5, we think a batch of votes heavily [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=162.16s)]
*  in Biden's favor is right, Person 5 responded, find a reason it isn't, give me options to file [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=168.8s)]
*  litigation. The colleague suggested there was about to be unrest reminiscent of the Brooks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=177.12s)]
*  Brothers riot, a violent effort to stop the vote count in Florida after the 2000 presidential election, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=182.8s)]
*  Person 5 responded, make them riot and do it. Make them riot. Of course, eventually we did get a riot. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  It was not like the Brooks Brothers riot of 2000 where Republican operatives posed as protesters to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=198.0s)]
*  demonstrate outside the Miami-Dade County election office and then try to force their way inside [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=203.36s)]
*  in an effort to stop the recount of the Florida election ballot results. This was far, far worse [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  and more widespread. A full-fledged deadly insurrection at our nation's Capitol, unlike [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  anything we've ever seen, really. Capitol ransacked, police officers having their brains bashed in. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  It was the end result of Donald Trump's scheme to corruptly pressure his running mate and vice president [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=223.84s)]
*  to overturn the election that they had lost without any legal or factual basis. When it became clear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=229.2s)]
*  that Mike Pence was not going to go along with the coup, when Donald Trump, well, he unleashed the rioters on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=236.48s)]
*  We've just heard that Mike Pence is not going to reject any fraudulent electoral vote. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=244.88s)]
*  That's right. You've heard it here first. Mike Pence has betrayed the United States of America. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=257.36s)]
*  Hey Mike Pence! Hey Mike Pence! Hey Mike Pence! Hey Mike Pence! [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=267.04s)]
*  Pence was set down into the basement of the Capitol for his own safety while the violent mob, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  urged on by Donald Trump, pillaged the Capitol, setting up a gallows outside him in chance for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=279.92s)]
*  Pence to be hanged. In addition to a lengthy recounting of Trump's many efforts to get Pence [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=284.48s)]
*  to steal the election, Smith's new filing also provides some insight to what was going through [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=290.24s)]
*  Trump's head when he learned his running mate was in danger. Upon receiving a phone call alerting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=294.56s)]
*  him that Pence had been taken to a secure location, someone identified as Person 15 rushed to the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=302.88s)]
*  dining room to inform Trump in hopes that Trump would take action to ensure Pence's safety. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=307.36s)]
*  Instead, after Person 15 delivered the news, Trump looked at him and said only, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  so what? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=318.88s)]
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Manno and Lawrence O'Donnell. It's good to have you here. First, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=321.36s)]
*  I'm just very curious to get your initial thoughts. Having had a little bit of time [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=327.44s)]
*  to go through the filing, Rachel, I'll start with you. It strikes me that there's two things here [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=331.84s)]
*  that are interesting. I don't know if surprising is the right word, but it seems substantial and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=338.08s)]
*  important. The first is why does this filing have to exist? We've already got a superseding [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=343.28s)]
*  indictment. This is to show the court that the immunity ruling from the Supreme Court didn't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  sink this case. You quoted some of the meat of that. There's a number of assertions at various [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  levels of specificity in the filing saying, listen, Trump was not doing this because he [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  was president of the United States. He was doing this as somebody who was running to try to win [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=365.76s)]
*  a next term as president of the United States. He was doing this privately. There's great, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=370.64s)]
*  very quotable lines. The executive branch has no authority or function to choose the next president. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=375.84s)]
*  To the extent that Trump was trying to affect the choice of the next president, he's doing so as a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=382.88s)]
*  candidate and as an interested party, but not as president. Also, as president, the defendant had [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=388.32s)]
*  no official responsibilities related to the state's administration of the election or the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=394.24s)]
*  appointment of their electors. The president has nothing to do with that. When he's pressuring [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=400.0s)]
*  state officials, he's talking to state officials about choosing their electors, he's doing something [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=404.56s)]
*  for which there is no presidential official responsibility. He cannot be immune from [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=409.76s)]
*  prosecution on those things on the basis of the fact that he was president when he did him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=414.64s)]
*  So that very clear, very like, you know, 10,000 layers of argument on that, I feel like, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=418.8s)]
*  is a very strong assertion from Jack Smith, from the prosecutors in the January 6th federal case, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  that the case is not sunk. The other thing that I think is important is that this happens [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=431.76s)]
*  right on the heels, within 24 hours of JD Vance rolling out among the most shameless, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=438.24s)]
*  smooth talking revisionist history about what Donald Trump did in January 6th and what happened [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=446.16s)]
*  at the end of the 2020 election than we've ever seen. And usually that kind of stuff is delivered [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  to a MAGA audience, right? Last night, it was delivered to more than 40 million Americans by [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  a guy who's very smooth talking and portrayed it as if it was no big deal. And maybe it's only [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=462.0s)]
*  the Democrats who think this was a big deal. This shows that that revisionist history is absolute [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=466.72s)]
*  bunk. And when the court, I think inevitably moves forward on the basis of this filing and says, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=472.72s)]
*  yeah, Trump's not immune, he should be prosecuted, this proves that the case against him, the criminal [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  case against him is very, very strong and very detailed. It arrives sort of right in time, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=482.48s)]
*  I think, to cut off what I think was the biggest blast and the most effective attempt at revisionist [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=488.48s)]
*  history on January 6th that we have yet seen. And it happened just last night. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  On that, on the first of those two points, when it comes to your second, Lawrence, but just on the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=498.56s)]
*  first of those two points, I recall as you're talking about this and as I was reading the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=502.08s)]
*  filing today, there's a moment in those immunity or arguments, which were sort of a disaster in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=505.28s)]
*  many cases and kind of shocking and appalling, if I can editorialize. But there's a moment where [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=510.56s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett intervenes essentially to do proactively what's done here, where she asks Trump's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=514.48s)]
*  lawyer, well, call the electors to try to like lobby them. Is that official act? He's like, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=521.76s)]
*  no, probably not. She goes through a bunch of the things that were asserted in that initial [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=526.4s)]
*  indictment to be like, we don't think those are official acts, do we? You're not arguing that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=530.96s)]
*  And it's interesting to see that come back around as essentially the core argument being made [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=535.2s)]
*  over the course of the 165 pages, although partly out of necessity because of what a focaccia ruling [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=540.24s)]
*  John Roberts came up with. Lawrence, your thoughts? Yeah, so I'm going to go to the highest authority [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=546.72s)]
*  I can go to tonight at 10 o'clock with Florence Tribe on this very issue that Rachel was describing, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  which was how the Supreme Court basically sent this back to the trial court and back to Jack [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=558.64s)]
*  Smith to say, to determine what, if anything, from the Smith indictment can be prosecuted. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  And this is Smith's answer, which is to say, well, everything. Yeah, we got it. There's one [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=570.56s)]
*  meeting that we can't include, which involved Justice Department. That one meeting, which we [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  just just say, Roberts explicitly goes out of his way to ding in his opinion. But what you do have [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=580.0s)]
*  in here because of this, and I remember the day this Supreme Court ruling came out, I mean, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=586.4s)]
*  my first reaction to it was that this was going to happen. I anticipated it happening in actual fact [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=590.4s)]
*  finding hearing with witnesses where we would hear Mike Pence. That might be the next stage of this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=596.64s)]
*  It could go to that. But as of now, it seems like Judge Schuchin wants to handle it on paper. And [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=602.24s)]
*  you can see how powerful the paper is. And you can see the power that a federal prosecutor has [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=607.76s)]
*  and subpoena power that the Congress doesn't. Because when you look at page 67, the source [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=613.76s)]
*  of the quotes in the second paragraph are Mike Pence's, quote, five pages of contemporaneous [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=619.36s)]
*  notes of a meeting with the president at the time. So there's the vice president just writing it all [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=626.96s)]
*  down. Which you better do any time you talk to the guy. And Jack Smith has all of those notes and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  quotes from them to the extent that he wants to. The other thing you see here, 165 pages is not the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwtqXvdITqs&t=637.04s)]
