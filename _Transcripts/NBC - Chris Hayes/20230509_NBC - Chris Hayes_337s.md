# George Santos criminally charged by DOJ, calls for McCarthy to remove him from Congress
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA)
*  I want to bring in another freshman New York congressman, Democrat Daniel Goldman, released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=0.0s)]
*  a statement shortly after the news saying, quote, it is incumbent on Speaker Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=5.64s)]
*  to eliminate the stain of Santos on this hallowed institution by removing him from Congress [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=9.38s)]
*  immediately. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=14.36s)]
*  All right, Congressman, hallowed seems a bit much. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=15.36s)]
*  You do know where you work, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=17.68s)]
*  We're regaining its hallowed nature by trying to get rid of George Santos. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=20.28s)]
*  Well, it always seemed like — it's funny. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=25.64s)]
*  This always seemed like what the game plan was from McCarthy et al. was, boy, this guy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=28.22s)]
*  seems like he's in a lot of trouble. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=34.22s)]
*  We'll just wait for the Deus ex machina of the feds or some other prosecutorial entity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=36.42s)]
*  to do the job. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=40.84s)]
*  But now it's like, well, he can just keep serving. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=42.28s)]
*  You know, McCarthy has said that his standard is the Fortenberry standard. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=44.3s)]
*  Fortenberry, who I believe was convicted or pleaded, I can't remember, to lying to federal [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=48.26s)]
*  was allowed to stay until the conviction and then was asked to leave. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=54.62s)]
*  But that's a long time for George Santos to serve in Congress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and it's completely unacceptable. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  Look, we have to recognize here several things that Josh just mentioned, some of them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=63.459999999999994s)]
*  First, George Santos has admitted to lying about numerous representations that he made [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=68.42s)]
*  on the campaign trail. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  Second, he has now been charged criminally, most likely, or at least there's public reporting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=75.62s)]
*  and I would be shocked if this were not the case, related to his effort to defraud the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=81.62s)]
*  voters of his district so that he could become a member of Congress. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=86.66s)]
*  To say now that, oh, those facts, as they will be laid out in an indictment, are insufficient [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=91.42s)]
*  to remove him from office is cyclical and preposterous in nature. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=98.34s)]
*  And so what I think and hope that the speaker recognizes is that his 218th vote is less [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=105.56s)]
*  important than the institution of Congress, hallowed or not, as you like to say, Chris. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=112.76s)]
*  But it is true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=119.4s)]
*  And we all walk around these halls. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=120.76s)]
*  We all take our job very seriously. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=123.62s)]
*  And for George Santos to have a vote that counts as much as my vote is a travesty. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=126.28s)]
*  And I think that hopefully the speaker will come around and recognize that that's the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=132.16s)]
*  right thing to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=136.26s)]
*  Well, we should note also that you this is not partisan, that other members of the New [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=137.26s)]
*  York class, the freshman class, have come to the same position. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=142.24s)]
*  This is Anthony Desposito, who's a Republican freshman in the, I think, adjacent district [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=147.0s)]
*  to George Santos. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=152.68s)]
*  He said, as a retired NYPD detective, I'm confident the justice system will fully reveal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=153.68s)]
*  his long history of deceit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=157.54s)]
*  I once again call on this serial fraudster to resign from office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=159.0s)]
*  Freshman Republican member Mike Lawler, who is in a district that Joe Biden won and is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=163.84s)]
*  considered one of the frontline folks in this next election. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=169.24s)]
*  I reiterate my call for George Santos to step down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=173.24s)]
*  Representative Stefanik in Republican leadership has not done that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=177.88s)]
*  She's also in the New York delegation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=181.46s)]
*  She seems fully gung-ho behind George Santos. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=183.04s)]
*  And she has been the entire time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=186.84s)]
*  She was George Santos' biggest advocate, his biggest endorser. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=188.96s)]
*  She fundraised for him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=192.96s)]
*  And she has not said anything about George Santos' pattern of deceit and lies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  And she's a part of Republican leadership. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=201.68s)]
*  And what is very clear is that they care much more about power and much more about having [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=203.72s)]
*  their 218 votes than they do about having a fraudster in their party representing nearly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=209.6s)]
*  800,000 people in Queens and Long Island. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=217.56s)]
*  And it's a total travesty, Chris. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=220.52s)]
*  It really comes down to what people think is wrong with Congress. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=222.0s)]
*  And the problem is that many people will not necessarily relate George Santos to a particular [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=228.8s)]
*  party or to a particular person, Stefanik or McCarthy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=235.28s)]
*  It sullies the reputation of the institution. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=240.04s)]
*  It really is time that we regain the confidence and trust of the American people by removing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=243.68s)]
*  George Santos. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=249.5s)]
*  Yeah, again, I should note that I think there's multiple members of both parties in the New [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=250.5s)]
*  York delegation have called for him to resign. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=254.2s)]
*  Basically, all the big wigs of the Nassau County Republican politics have called for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=256.28s)]
*  him to resign. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=262.48s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, they did a big press conference. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=263.48s)]
*  That was the one where it was revealed that he had lied about being like a star volleyball [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=266.38s)]
*  player for Baruch College, which is one of my favorite George Soros tall tales. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=270.48s)]
*  But this is like it's sort of a bizarre and almost intolerable situation where it just [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=275.56s)]
*  seems like there's a consensus like this guy lied. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=279.0s)]
*  He shouldn't be there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Now there's going to be federal charges tomorrow. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy is like tough, basically. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Well look at look at the history recent history, Chris. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  George Santos was the deciding vote on the debt limit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=291.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=294.12s)]
*  George Santos was the deciding vote to make Kevin McCarthy speaker of the House. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=295.12s)]
*  This is very transactional for the speaker to maintain his power and his speakership. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=299.74s)]
*  And so clearly he's going to go down with George Santos as far as he will go. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=305.82s)]
*  All right, Congressman Daniel Goldman also representing New York in this Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=311.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFeZ6lQfyoA&t=315.5s)]
