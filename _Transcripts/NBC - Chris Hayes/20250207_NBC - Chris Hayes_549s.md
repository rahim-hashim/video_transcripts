# Elon Musk says Department of Education no longer ‘exists’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y)
*  The next department that appears to be on the chopping block is the Department of Education. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Just earlier today, Democratic members of Congress were blocked from entering the department's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=6.0s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=10.0s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers had met outside to protest Donald Trump and Elon Musk's plan to abolish [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=11.6s)]
*  the department entirely, as well as attempting to seek a meeting with the department's senior [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=16.8s)]
*  leadership. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Lawmakers were not only blocked by security holding the front door, but also by Department [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=24.2s)]
*  of Homeland Security police seen in multiple videos from members of Congress. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=29.76s)]
*  Lawmakers were told by security guards stationed outside that nobody had accepted a meeting [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=35.36s)]
*  and that they needed an escort in the building, an escort in order to enter the building. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  The door, he says he's a federal employee. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=47.36s)]
*  He won't tell us who gave him permission to do this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=50.56s)]
*  All he knows is he's going to stand here and tell the members of Congress who are elected, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=53.96s)]
*  who vote for the funding for all of them in this building, and for the student loans, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=60.36s)]
*  and for the Title I families, he's going to tell us that we can't come in and talk with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=67.56s)]
*  anybody. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=73.56s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=74.56s)]
*  Joining me now is one of the lawmakers who tried to enter the Department of Education [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=77.56s)]
*  today, Congresswoman Johanna Hayes, Democrat of Connecticut, and a 2016 National Teacher [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=81.36s)]
*  of the Year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=88.86s)]
*  It's a great pleasure, Congresswoman. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=90.76s)]
*  Let's just get right to the bottom. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=94.16s)]
*  Who tried to stop you, and under what authority were they acting to block members of Congress? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=96.4s)]
*  That's the part I have to wrap my head around. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=104.32s)]
*  Who found the very department that they're standing there blocking members from coming [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=106.68s)]
*  into the building? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=111.56s)]
*  Well, thank you, Michael, and it's great to be here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And that's a great question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=118.0s)]
*  We did not get an answer to that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=119.48s)]
*  The man who came out, he met us at the door. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=121.12s)]
*  The door was locked, and then he came out and met us and said we were not allowed entry [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  to the building. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=128.4s)]
*  We had to be on a guest list. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=129.4s)]
*  And when I said, well, what is your name? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=131.0s)]
*  What is your title? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=132.84s)]
*  All he would say is, I work for the Department of Education. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=134.02s)]
*  Never said who he was. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=137.22s)]
*  Now kept pulling out a badge and pulling it back quickly. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=138.82000000000002s)]
*  But we said, we're members of Congress. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=142.5s)]
*  We can come into the building. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  We can request a meeting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=146.06s)]
*  Would not even let us inside the building. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=150.06s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=151.06s)]
*  Well, it also kind of begs the question, what do you do next? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=152.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is the fourth time or so that members of Congress have been denied [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  access to federal property. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=162.94s)]
*  It's not a question of what Democrats do, what a Republican. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=166.78s)]
*  What do members of Congress do when something like this happens? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=170.18s)]
*  What do you think should happen next? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=174.1s)]
*  Well, I think that's really important. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=176.5s)]
*  I think part of the problem is the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has ceded all [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=179.78s)]
*  of our Article 1 powers to the President. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=184.34s)]
*  In this case, the Speaker of the House should be saying we need to respect the separation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  of powers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  But I know that is not going to happen. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  So we are bracing for lawsuits. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=196.46s)]
*  We've sent letters to the department requesting a meeting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  Ninety-six members of Congress signed on to this meeting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  Outside groups are gearing up to file lawsuits because we read Project 2025. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=206.3s)]
*  We know what's next. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  We know what's coming. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  And he, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, this whole administration, is going play by play in what [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  we saw in this Project 2025. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=218.38s)]
*  But one thing I don't think people understand. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=221.82s)]
*  For me, it was important to go to the department because, and request this meeting, because [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=225.02s)]
*  I'm open to, if you want to audit the department, if you want to make reforms, let's talk about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=230.18s)]
*  it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=235.1s)]
*  Let's work together and see what we need to do. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=236.1s)]
*  They don't want to do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=239.06s)]
*  They want to tear everything down, just like they talked about in your last segment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=240.34s)]
*  And I hope people understand what that means. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=244.36s)]
*  A lot of the things that Republicans are complaining about that they don't like about the department [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=247.14s)]
*  with curriculum and things that happen in the school, those are local issues, not decided [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=251.42s)]
*  by the Department of Education. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=255.5s)]
*  What the department does handle is the $1.6 trillion in student loan funds, special education, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=257.42s)]
*  making sure that students aren't discriminated against, collecting data and statistics from [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=264.14s)]
*  school, preparing educators to teach our students, running Title I programs for our lowest income [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  communities. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=275.7s)]
*  All of those things will be affected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=277.06s)]
*  And people need to understand if those programs are cut, one of two things are going to happen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=279.06s)]
*  If the department is cut, one of two things are going to happen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  Either those programs are going to go away or their taxes are going to go up to fund [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=286.26s)]
*  their local school systems. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=290.5s)]
*  Our children deserve better. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=292.34s)]
*  Forty-nine million children attend public school in this country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=293.98s)]
*  And for Elon Musk to come in with no planning, no forethought, and just plow through these [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=297.62s)]
*  agencies with no plan to rebuild them or what's going to happen to the people that are affected [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=302.74s)]
*  is just completely wrong. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  And the members of Congress are going to stand up to that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=311.06s)]
*  It appears that Elon Musk, Vice President Elon Musk, I guess, he's got some role, some [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=314.3s)]
*  official role, thinks that the Department of Education is already dead in response to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=321.94s)]
*  Congress' Maxwell Frost post about the DOE. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=328.1s)]
*  He said, quote, No such department exists in the federal government. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=332.7s)]
*  You're an educator, a former teacher of the year, someone who knows education better than [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=337.74s)]
*  most. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=342.18s)]
*  You talked just a moment ago about the programs that are impacted both at the federal and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=343.18s)]
*  state level. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=348.54s)]
*  What does this ultimately mean for parents out there and school systems across the country [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=351.38s)]
*  that now will have to scramble to your point to figure out where those federal dollars [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=357.18s)]
*  come from? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=361.58s)]
*  Because a block grant is not going to cut it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=362.58s)]
*  We know how block grants ultimately work, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=365.14s)]
*  And that's just it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=370.74s)]
*  Elon Musk's children don't need public schools. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=372.06s)]
*  They're not relying on the services that are provided in public school. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=375.06s)]
*  Donald Trump's children don't need public schools. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=378.38s)]
*  It's my friends and neighbors. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=381.02s)]
*  It's the kids that I taught. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  1.5 million children receive special education services, wraparound services, accommodations, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=385.34s)]
*  IEPs, the things that they need in order to learn and meet their educational goals. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=391.73999999999995s)]
*  So many of our rural communities that don't have charter schools, that don't wouldn't [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=397.34s)]
*  be able to take advantage of some of these voucher programs, people need to think about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=402.38s)]
*  that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=406.78s)]
*  All of those children will be denied a public education. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=407.78s)]
*  We had our committee hearing yesterday. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=411.62s)]
*  The chairman said 1 million students access vouchers for private charter schools. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=414.26s)]
*  They want to take all this money from the Department of Education and put it into voucher [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=422.14s)]
*  programs. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=426.18s)]
*  There are not enough spaces for all of the children. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=427.18s)]
*  What are we going to do with all of these kids? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  And people really need to think about that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=432.9s)]
*  A nation that doesn't invest in their children, that doesn't prepare them to be global citizens, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=435.14s)]
*  to meet the workforce. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=441.1s)]
*  We are going to lose a whole generation of kids. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=442.74s)]
*  And it's not just the Department of Education. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  They're going after funding for Head Start and HHS. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeuxwD5274Y&t=447.38s)]
