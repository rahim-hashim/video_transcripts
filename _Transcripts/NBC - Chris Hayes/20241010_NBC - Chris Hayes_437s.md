# Obama rips Trump on campaign trail: ‘For Trump, freedom is getting away with stuff’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A)
*  I want to play for you a bit a riff that he did on freedom that I thought was very interesting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=0.0s)]
*  talking about freedom in this election and sort of this is something the Harris campaign [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=4.48s)]
*  is really focused on as a kind of an issue they have the upper hand, that word and what [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=9.48s)]
*  it means, of course, using the Beyonce freedom song at all the campaign rallies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Here's ex-president Barack Obama talking about freedom and what it means. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=21.0s)]
*  For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=23.200000000000003s)]
*  Fireworkers for trying to organize a union, Dodge paying their fair share of taxes, try [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=33.92s)]
*  to throw out your votes when they lose an election, control what women can and can't [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=40.88s)]
*  do with their bodies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=47.56s)]
*  In other words, for Trump, freedom is getting away with stuff. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=52.24s)]
*  I thought that was really a powerful line. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=58.68s)]
*  A lot of things have been said about Donald Trump over these low these many years, but [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=62.84s)]
*  that I thought cut to the quick. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  What do you think, Alex? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=66.92s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's just reminding people that Trump views himself as someone who is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  above the fray relative to the average person, which really cuts away at this idea of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=75.28s)]
*  faux populism that Trump tries to sell, which is that he's the everyman, just like every [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  other voter who's watching him, which is certainly just not true. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=86.08s)]
*  I think Obama not only helps sell that message, but Harris helps sell that message when she's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  talking about her upbringing and who she is relative to who Donald Trump is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=96.52s)]
*  I also don't think it helps that Donald Trump, even though it's not just him, Barron Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=101.08s)]
*  is getting headlines recently, allegedly saying things like, oh, I wasn't fed with a silver [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=107.28s)]
*  spoon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=112.88s)]
*  I was fed with a gold spoon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=113.88s)]
*  And so I think that people are starting to see this idea of who the Trump family is by [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=115.88s)]
*  way of Barron Trump, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=120.76s)]
*  And they really know that they're not just the everyman or this faux populist person that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=125.04s)]
*  he tries to sell himself to be. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=129.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of sort of populism in that 2012 Obama campaign, Congresswoman. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=131.24s)]
*  And you saw it again here about things like tax cuts, things like who Donald Trump is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  looking out for, who Kamala Harris, trying to bring it really back to there's character. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=143.8s)]
*  There's a sort of character argument and the kind of meat and potatoes argument. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=148.4s)]
*  Do you think does that stuff still matter? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=152.0s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder if our politics have gotten so bizarre and insane that the basics of like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=155.56s)]
*  who is going to benefit you, he's going to raise your taxes on terrorists. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=162.8s)]
*  Four thousand dollars. She wants to give you tax breaks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  How much that gets through. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  I have the same fear. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=172.0s)]
*  I think that what's happening is that there's so much information, so much disinformation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=173.52s)]
*  We have become so accustomed to lies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Right. It's the thing that most people, the number one thing that people think about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=181.68s)]
*  politicians are that they lie, is that they're dishonest or that they're hiding one hand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=184.96s)]
*  And I think that what the results of that is, is that people no longer know what to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=189.6s)]
*  trust when people hear when we hear things. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=194.32s)]
*  So even when you get substance is speeches like this, you start to wonder, well, you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=196.28s)]
*  know what, are they just talking or someone actually going to come out and do things? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=200.8s)]
*  So on the one hand, I think that more than the speeches, more than the rallies, I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  that deep down what Americans want to see, they want to see, they want to, you know, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=209.28s)]
*  they want to go outside. They want to see that when they go to the grocery store, that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=213.72s)]
*  their groceries are less. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=216.56s)]
*  They want to be able to buy a house. They want to be able to to live comfortably. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=218.36s)]
*  They want their children to be safe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  They want them to be able to go to schools that are well paid. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=226.08s)]
*  Right. That's what people are looking for. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=227.96s)]
*  And all they kind of are getting is the bickering. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=229.36s)]
*  They're getting the absurdity. They're getting the circus. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=231.32s)]
*  So while it benefits the media, it's really served to make discerning what we want and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=233.32s)]
*  what we are getting out of politics so much harder for everyday people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=239.68s)]
*  And we really have to fight back against that instinct of allowing that to be like the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=243.48s)]
*  normal in our politics. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=247.24s)]
*  Yeah. To that point about sort of the nastiness, I'm not going to play the clip, but I [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=249.24s)]
*  just Alexi today, Trump was in Detroit and said, if Harris is elected, you want to know [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=253.24s)]
*  the truth, it'll be like Detroit. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=260.48s)]
*  Our whole country will end up being like Detroit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=262.04s)]
*  If she's your president, you're going to have a mess on your hands. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=265.56s)]
*  Not particularly subtle, but that is basically the that is basically 100 percent of that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=268.24s)]
*  campaign at this point. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=274.24s)]
*  He's flailing. I mean, like his pitch is literally at this point, like pick the white guy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=277.28s)]
*  or the black girl. And he's asking people who are the most racist of this country to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=282.44s)]
*  support him and to actually come out and vote because that's who he knows he needs to get [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=287.56s)]
*  out to vote in order to win this election. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=292.28s)]
*  Like those are his swing voters at the end of the day. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=294.4s)]
*  And that is what is so alarming about this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=296.72s)]
*  And, you know, I thought it was really interesting when former President Obama said [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=299.12s)]
*  basically like, hey, men, male voters, I don't care if you think that women are weak. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=302.48s)]
*  You need to reconsider what you think about Kamala Harris and really focus on the facts [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=307.56s)]
*  because this is not a joke. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, that's how I interpreted what he was saying to male voters in his speech today [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=312.64s)]
*  because it is incredibly important because those are not only the folks who are not only [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=316.48s)]
*  not voting, but if they do go out and vote, they are most likely, according to polls, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=320.48s)]
*  going to vote for someone like Donald Trump because of mis and disinformation and because [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=325.28s)]
*  of sexism, as we know, with the idea that women are just not as strong as men as leaders. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=329.55999999999995s)]
*  And this idea that even though Donald Trump is clearly suffering cognitive decline and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  does not have the mental acuity to be president, he is physically fit to some people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=341.11999999999995s)]
*  But that is not the same as what it takes to be president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=347.84s)]
*  So I think that was very interesting. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, I mean, Barack Obama doing a long riff on sort of men who think that he's an example [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  of strength and how sort of wrongheaded I think like preposterous that is he said those [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=357.56s)]
*  words about Detroit in Detroit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=363.88s)]
*  We should know at the Detroit Economic Club, although I've been to the Detroit Economic [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=365.24s)]
*  Club, I think, and a lot of people driving in from outside of Detroit to go to the Detroit [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Economic Club. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=374.16s)]
*  Congresswoman Summer Lee and Alexi McCammond. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=375.16s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=378.64s)]
*  Coming up, the new Republican push for increased government spending. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=380.36s)]
*  How Donald Trump's own disinformation has thrown his party's priorities completely [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=384.04s)]
*  out of whack. Next. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=387.76s)]
*  Or diapers. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=390.16s)]
*  I remember buying that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=393.36s)]
*  You think Donald Trump ever changed the diaper? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=395.32s)]
*  I almost said that, but I decided I shouldn't say it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGHIx2B5D9A&t=409.36s)]
