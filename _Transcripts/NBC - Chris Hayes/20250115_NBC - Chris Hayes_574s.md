# Maddow What Biden said for the ‘first time’ in his farewell address
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA)
*  Still with me Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid, and Jen Psaki. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=0.0s)]
*  Joy, one of the things that is striking about this warning about the tech industrial complex is I [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=4.48s)]
*  think everyone feels a little head spun by how quickly this has all seemed to congeal in terms of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=10.16s)]
*  Bezos [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=17.84s)]
*  Zuckerberg, you know there was first Elon Musk, but this sort of kissing the ring first [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=19.12s)]
*  It's like we're changing our policies, but also we're gonna be inauguration and we're gonna throw an inauguration ball [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=23.7s)]
*  We're gonna give him money and then Melania is gonna get a deal like suddenly this sort of vision of what this could like an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=28.44s)]
*  Oligarchy not in some metaphorical sense. Yeah, but in the very real and recognizable sense of like a few guys and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=34.72s)]
*  The head of the country right and the question is who owns the ring because it's not quite clear that Trump is the owner [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=43.0s)]
*  Of it because in the end when they're sitting on that dais they're gonna be sitting in a position of tremendous power [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=49.44s)]
*  Over him one of the other pieces of news Rachel mentioned him a Biden making news [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=55.2s)]
*  He said we should ban members of Congress from trading in stock while in office [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  One of the sort of dirty little secrets is the oligarchy was already here [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=63.52s)]
*  like America has sort of been hurtling toward oligarchy from the very beginning when it was a few plantation owners and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=67.44s)]
*  Everyone else couldn't vote right even you know white men without land couldn't vote and we've been sort of trying to pull ourselves [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=72.94s)]
*  away from it and the 20th century [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=79.0s)]
*  Which is the century that so offends Leonard Leo and Sam Alito and others the 20th century was the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=81.4s)]
*  Era the American century when America pulled itself back from this notion of oligarchy to an incredible extent [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=89.16s)]
*  Invented a middle class the things President Biden was talking about in that first nine minutes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=96.52s)]
*  those are the things that the 20th century built when we beat back the robber barons and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=100.88s)]
*  Gotten and beat back the trust and established an income tax which didn't exist until the 20th century established women's rights [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Civil rights immigrant rights, that's the 20th century and these oligarchs who's not they've always been there [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=113.56s)]
*  Who do you think was paying for you know, Rush Limbaugh? He was a very wealthy man [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=119.64s)]
*  Fox is owned by an oligarch. Who do they think is funding the Ben Shapiro and other podcasts the oligarchy's been hidden in the background [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=124.08s)]
*  the whole time and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden is this pivot president as [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=134.12s)]
*  America is hurtling towards sort of falling in love with these rich tech gods these tech bros [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  then you have Biden sort of sandwiched in the middle of Trump and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=142.4s)]
*  Trump trying to go the oligarch way the first time with some hurdles and then [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden offering this small pivot where it's suddenly labor is put is getting wins, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=150.56s)]
*  Where he's standing on picket lines where you're suddenly seeing unions come back and you're seeing him say no [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna build our bridges our roads stuff that regular folks can enjoy you have this pivot and then we're going back [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=161.92s)]
*  He is that wedge that was between us and an oligarchy [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=168.84s)]
*  We've been hurtling toward for a very long time the repeal of the 20th century is what's happening in this country and Biden tried [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=172.62s)]
*  To hold the dam together and now he's he's walking away, but he's saying you still have to try to hold the line [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=180.12s)]
*  Jen I was I think one of the defining features of the Biden presidency which was on display in this speech is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=187.76s)]
*  the substantive success and the political shortcomings, you know, I mean and I just say that as you know [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=194.44s)]
*  Just a reference to the the approval rating and you know what ended up happening the election [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=200.68s)]
*  How do you think about that? How do you think he thinks about it? How did you see that tonight on the speech? I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Know he is deeply frustrated about it. I think for good reason that he has not received [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=213.6s)]
*  the acknowledgement of what he's accomplished economically and what he's done for the country as it relates to the climate agenda and a lot of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=220.56s)]
*  Progressive domestic policies and I know you've talked about this Chris [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=228.64s)]
*  All of us have talked about this and that is frustrating [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=231.8s)]
*  Which is why I also think it took a tremendous amount of self-restraint [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=234.9s)]
*  Not to use this speech as an opportunity to tell the country all of the things that he did for the progressive domestic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=238.76s)]
*  policy agenda [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=245.76s)]
*  And that meant that that also means that everything had line there the warning to the country about oligarchs about power in the hands [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  of a few about the tech industrial complex and his hope and call for the American people to step up and stand guard and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=254.48s)]
*  Stand up for what makes us who we are is more important to him than getting credit [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=262.2s)]
*  For what he's accomplished in this moment and that tells you a great deal because every president wants credit [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=268.32s)]
*  They did have one line in here Chris where he said it's going to take some time to feel the impact [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=272.96s)]
*  the seeds are planted which is which is how they have been messaging and I think there is a truth to this in the sense that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  inflation numbers are coming down and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=287.08s)]
*  A lot of these projects and infrastructure projects are going to be built over the next couple of years [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=289.48s)]
*  That's a challenging legacy thing to talk about because we all know Donald Trump is going to show up [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=294.0s)]
*  With a bunch of his friends and he's going to take credit for big bridges that are being built that have are hiring hundreds of people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=300.36s)]
*  Even though he railed against these bills. So that is a tremendous challenge [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=307.8s)]
*  So the last thing I just wanted to say it just as I was listening to joy and Alex made this punch [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=312.24s)]
*  I think is an important one. It's not just Trump. That is the cause of the rise of the oligarchy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=315.8s)]
*  We've all talked about this I know and Rachel's been the the leader as in of all things on this point [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=320.68s)]
*  I mean JD Vance is like the Manchurian candidate of the tech industrial complex [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=325.44s)]
*  He is 40 41 years old however old he is. He's young and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=331.36s)]
*  He is the future Ben Shapiro is the future [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk all of them are yes, they're betting on Trump because he's gonna be president, but let's not be naive here [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=340.16s)]
*  They are betting on the MAGA expansion and all aspects of that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=345.8s)]
*  That is even beyond a incoming president who is 80. I [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=350.72s)]
*  Will say Rachel one one thought I had and curious what you think here [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=355.96s)]
*  It's interesting for me to Biden to name this and we're all gonna see it on display on the 20th, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=360.88s)]
*  So you will see Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos if things go according to reporting and Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk up there. I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=366.04s)]
*  Think as ominous as it portends for American democracy along the lines of the president's warning [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=373.8s)]
*  There is something usefully clarifying about it and there's something usefully clarifying in Joe Biden calling it out [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=379.46s)]
*  which is to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=387.38s)]
*  Name what is happening in front of us and name it for the purposes of political action by citizens [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=388.98s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean I continue to think that the most important thing that President Biden did tonight was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=395.78s)]
*  Name this thing but also connect it to why it matters and why that why it's a bad thing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=402.62s)]
*  Because one of the things about capitalism in general one of the things that's also true about oligarchic societies [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=407.62s)]
*  Is that one rational way to react to seeing the richest man on earth and all of these? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=413.22s)]
*  Multi-billionaires with all this power is to think cool. I want to be like that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=420.38000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and to think like oh those cool guys who I want to be like look they're being brought into the government [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=423.74s)]
*  That's that's cool [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=430.24s)]
*  And what the important thing that President Biden was trying to convey tonight is when he said what this is doing is it is enabling [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=431.3s)]
*  abuse of power even [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=439.18s)]
*  After he talked about the Statue of Liberty thing before he even gave his warning [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  He said we need the courage to stand up to abuse of power and the warning about oligarchy and the concentration of power and wealth [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=444.54s)]
*  In this extreme way that we're seeing in this very small number of people is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=451.86s)]
*  To abuse power and when power is abused regular people get hurt [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=456.38s)]
*  Everybody other than the very small number of people at the top get hurt [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  It means your government doesn't work anymore. Not only does it not work for you, which it probably isn't doing anyway [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=464.82s)]
*  It doesn't work period because it's to serve their interests [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, people who are in business people who are entrepreneurial people who want to build things [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=473.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=478.1s)]
*  You're not gonna get to keep them if there are oligarchs who are interlinked with government power [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=478.3s)]
*  Who are going to control both the economy and the government? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=483.46s)]
*  It means you either need to be related to somebody named Trump or you need to be part of an oligarchic [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=486.61999999999995s)]
*  Unit to be able to get anything from the government and everybody else in government is [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=493.38s)]
*  Disserved by it and stolen from in order to support that and that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=497.94s)]
*  Tonight, I think I feel like I'm hearing President Biden articulate for the first time [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=502.73999999999995s)]
*  Maybe him doing it as this clarion warning on his way out the door will [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=506.26s)]
*  Make more people follow up on that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=510.46s)]
*  But I do think we haven't yet had the discussion in this country about why oligarchy is bad. It's bad for your economy [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=512.18s)]
*  It's bad for your democracy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=518.74s)]
*  Yes [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=520.54s)]
*  But it's also bad for individual people for the regular things we need to do in order to protect our families and live the kind [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=521.06s)]
*  Of lives that we want to live [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=528.02s)]
*  Oligarchy suck for 99.99 percent of people who live in them and President Biden is finally starting to give that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=529.5s)]
*  Practical warning. It's a great point [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=537.22s)]
*  One of the lessons of this era. It's not the most important one is that even 250 billion dollars can't actually make you cool [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=539.5s)]
*  Something that we've learned firm, but fair [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=545.74s)]
*  Joy Reid and Jen Psaki [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=548.98s)]
*  You [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOLD7li7DA&t=569.46s)]
