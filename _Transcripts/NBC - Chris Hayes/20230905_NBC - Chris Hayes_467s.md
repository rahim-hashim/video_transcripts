# Impeachment trial begins for Texas Republican Ken Paxton
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME)
*  Today is the first day of the impeachment trial, one of the most notorious figures in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas politics, Republican State Attorney General Ken Paxton. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=4.3s)]
*  Mr. Paxton should be removed from office because he failed to protect the state and instead [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=9.76s)]
*  used the power of his elected office for his own benefit. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=14.92s)]
*  And Mr. Paxton had an obligation not to abuse his office for his own benefit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=19.44s)]
*  He betrayed his constituents and the sacred public trust that's been given him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=25.16s)]
*  And in Texas, we require more from our public officials than to merely avoid being a criminal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=30.72s)]
*  Paxton is facing 20 impeachment articles from the Republican State Senate, including corruption, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=37.16s)]
*  misuse of public funds, and abuse of public trust. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=41.6s)]
*  In many ways, Paxton is a Trump before Trump kind of figure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=44.0s)]
*  Back in 2015, he was even indicted on security fraud charges, although he denies them and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=47.86s)]
*  has yet to go to trial. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=52.54s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=54.0s)]
*  Eight years later, he hasn't faced trial. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Back in October 2020, eight former top officials in Paxton's own office accused him of bribery [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  and abusing his power as AG. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=63.68s)]
*  He settled a lawsuit for more than three million dollars with those former employees, and then [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=65.8s)]
*  he tried to use state funds to pay it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=70.2s)]
*  Now, a lot of Paxton's record has been in the public record for years, but Republicans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=73.2s)]
*  have stuck by him until now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=78.44s)]
*  And that is the large part because, like Trump, Paxton has a keen sense for where the party [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=81.28s)]
*  base is at politically. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=85.72s)]
*  He sued the Obama and Biden administrations more than two dozen times each. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=87.68s)]
*  He also helped lead Trump's legal challenge to overturning the 2020 election. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  It's no surprise that the ex-president is publicly defending Paxton, writing on social [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=96.08s)]
*  media, quote, Hopefully Republicans in the Texas House will agree this is a very unfair [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=100.08s)]
*  process that should not be allowed to happen or proceed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  I will fight you if it does. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  But Texas Republicans don't appear to be afraid of that fight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=109.52s)]
*  I will fight you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=112.72s)]
*  At least for now, it seems as though they really have just had enough of this guy and his [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=114.8s)]
*  brazen antics, and they're ready to solve their Ken Paxton problem. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=117.84s)]
*  Texas state representative Jarvis Johnson is a Democrat representing Houston. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  He's a member of the Appropriations Committee, which Ken Paxton asked to cover his three [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=125.52s)]
*  point three million dollar whistleblower settlement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=129.56s)]
*  And, Representative, it's good to have you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=132.04s)]
*  First, just give me a read on the opening day of this, what this means for Texas politics, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=134.2s)]
*  given that Paxton is an enormously powerful and influential figure and that this is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=139.48s)]
*  fundamentally a kind of Republican on Republican exercise. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=145.0s)]
*  They have supermajorities in both houses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=147.92s)]
*  Paxton's a Republican. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=150.12s)]
*  They've just decided enough. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=151.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think this is where we are, not only in this state, in this country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=154.68s)]
*  I think when you see an elected official that continues to abuse their power at some point [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=159.32s)]
*  or another, the body has to then take charge. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  And I'm so happy that the body has taken charge and decided to then indict Paxton to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=170.2s)]
*  then go to trial for impeachment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=177.88s)]
*  And this was bipartisan support across the board. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  There are many that want to say that all the Democrats created this and it's Democrats, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  it's Democrats. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  That's just talking points for some groups just to simply not pay attention to what is real. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=190.76s)]
*  And that is politicians in this state are tired of elected officials taking full advantage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  of the office and abusing their power. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=204.76s)]
*  What we see is Paxton abuse the power so that he can further gain himself and his family [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=208.04s)]
*  and for his friends. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=214.6s)]
*  That's illegal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  And so at that point, now we're going to trial. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=217.96s)]
*  And at this point, we will see. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  I will say that when you just mentioned Donald Trump, that can be a very scary and very [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=223.48s)]
*  intimidating point that he is making. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=231.2s)]
*  That if in fact, that Paxton is indicted and is kicked out of office, that you have a former [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=233.56s)]
*  president that says there will be reciprocity, that there will be repercussions for their [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=240.56s)]
*  actions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=245.88s)]
*  That's very fearful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=246.84s)]
*  I'm very afraid of that type of mentality that can skew and slant a decision in favor of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  without taking into consideration all of the evidence that's out there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=258.88s)]
*  And by the way, we've been placed as elected officials, as state representatives and senators [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=264.76s)]
*  to be placed under a gag order. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=270.12s)]
*  It's kind of unusual and rich because at any given time, and the reason why we were placed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=272.0s)]
*  under gag orders is because we didn't want to unduly influence the bottom. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=277.92s)]
*  I will say that there's never in the last 10 years, I can't imagine any Democrats saying [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=284.24s)]
*  anything that would have skewed or changed the mind of any Republican when it comes to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=290.12s)]
*  making that decision. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=294.68s)]
*  They're like, well, if we lost Jarvis Johnson, then I mean, we're totally screwed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=295.68s)]
*  So, you know, that's the whole point. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  So I think it's disingenuous to place that type of gag order, because as any official, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=304.52s)]
*  my constituents want to hear me. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=310.2s)]
*  They want to know my opinion. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=312.16s)]
*  They want to know where I stand on this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=313.88s)]
*  But unfortunately, being placed under a gag order and then with the threat of being prosecuted [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=315.8s)]
*  kind of makes me step back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=322.28s)]
*  But I won't be silent and I won't not go before my constituents to let them know the truth [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=324.64s)]
*  and what is truly happening in this in the Senate hearing for impeachment of Paxton. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=330.88s)]
*  So my understanding is that the sort of predicate here is that he got this really sort of, I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=336.52s)]
*  thought, very damning document by whistleblowers, people that worked for him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=343.76s)]
*  These again, these weren't like the liberals are out to get pen capped, can't tax people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=346.56s)]
*  work for him, citing different ways they felt he abused his office. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=350.2s)]
*  He settled with them and then he went to the Texas state coffers to say, pay me for this [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=353.92s)]
*  settlement. And my understanding is that the appropriation committee you sit on said, no, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=358.92s)]
*  we won't. And then he just used the money anyway. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=363.2s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=365.72s)]
*  Well, no, he tried. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  He tried. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=369.68s)]
*  He tried. One of the very questions that I asked of Paxton and his team while he was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=370.72s)]
*  sitting at the during a hearing was, do you have money in your own campaign account to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=375.88s)]
*  pay for this? Why should taxpayers pay for a mistake that you personally made, that you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=382.76s)]
*  decided to make? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=390.2s)]
*  And his comments were, well, I'm an elected official. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=391.88s)]
*  And because of that, then the state would be responsible. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=395.72s)]
*  And of course, he didn't want to further have any more dialogue about that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=400.72s)]
*  But the opportunity was there for Paxton to pay the money on his own campaign. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=404.36s)]
*  And I think because of the fact that he didn't pay it was the straw that broke the camel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=411.24s)]
*  Yeah. I think for many of the Republicans that then decided to go for impeachment, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=416.68s)]
*  for an impeachment movement. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=423.96s)]
*  And there's money there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=426.08s)]
*  Right. We even. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem outrageous to not give him the money from the state [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=432.56s)]
*  coffers to pay for his settlement with his whistleblower, Texas state representative [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=438.44s)]
*  Jarvis Johnson, who sits on the in the state assembly on the appropriations committee. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVTjIHC1ME&t=445.79999999999995s)]
