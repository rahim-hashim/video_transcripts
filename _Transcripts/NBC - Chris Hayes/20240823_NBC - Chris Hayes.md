# Palestinian-American lawmaker denied opportunity to speak at DNC shares what she would've said
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws)
*  This week we saw a really well-produced Democratic convention which clearly was seeking to, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=0.0s)]
*  I think successfully sought to construct this big tent that welcomes as broad a political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=5.72s)]
*  coalition as possible. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=9.6s)]
*  So, for example, we saw Senator Bernie Sanders rallying against the ruling class, followed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=10.6s)]
*  by Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker boasting the fact that he is a billionaire. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  We saw the exonerated Central Park Five on the need for criminal justice reform, followed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=20.28s)]
*  by prosecutors selling Kamala Harris as the tough on crime candidate. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=24.04s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Elizabeth Warren rallying the progressive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=28.6s)]
*  base and former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan, former Congressman Adam Kinzinger [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=32.6s)]
*  welcoming Republicans in the fold. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=37.36s)]
*  There's one glaring exception this week which was on the issue of Israel and Gaza and the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  ongoing war there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=44.300000000000004s)]
*  The convention heard incredibly moving, searing, compassionate words from the parents of Hirsch [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  Goldberg-Polin, who's one of the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=50.66s)]
*  We've met with President Biden and Vice President Harris numerous times at the White House. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=57.0s)]
*  They're both working tirelessly for a hostage and ceasefire deal that will bring our precious [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=64.16s)]
*  children, mothers, fathers, spouses, grandparents and grandchildren home and will stop the despair [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=71.76s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  And Harris herself brought the crowd to its feet with a condemnation of Hamas's brutality [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  paired with a call for Palestinian self-determination. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=96.12s)]
*  President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=100.2s)]
*  are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=107.0s)]
*  to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=114.4s)]
*  But absent from the stage on any day across the four days were any Palestinian-American [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  voices. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  The uncommitted delegates attempted to negotiate a speaking slot with the DNC, but their efforts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=126.76s)]
*  were ultimately rebuffed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=131.52s)]
*  So joining me now is one of the Palestinian-Americans who requested to submit a speech to the DNC [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  for vetting to deliver. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Georgia State Representative Ruha Roman, who attended the convention and intended to endorse [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris but was not granted permission to speak. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=143.86s)]
*  Representative, it's great to have you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=147.36s)]
*  And I guess what I want to hear from you is what you wanted to say, what you would have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=148.88s)]
*  told folks had you had the opportunity to get up there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=158.24s)]
*  And I want to be clear, although I'm not an uncommitted delegate, I wasn't even a convention [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=160.52s)]
*  attendee. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=165.0s)]
*  I was there for a different panel with American Institute. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=166.0s)]
*  I was asked by uncommitted if I would help push for a speaker. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=169.0s)]
*  And that's sort of how the conversation about a speech even started. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=174.36s)]
*  Some members of Congress wanted to be able to vouch for a potential speaker, asked for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=178.16s)]
*  some sample language, and we provided it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=183.04s)]
*  And the language that we wrote was meant to be in good faith. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=185.4s)]
*  It included an endorsement. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=189.68s)]
*  It included a call for unity. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=192.0s)]
*  It included a personal story. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=194.32s)]
*  The reality is anyone who knows me knows I'm incredibly passionate about this issue. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=197.0s)]
*  I am Palestinian. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=199.6s)]
*  I have a responsibility for this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=200.6s)]
*  And so even though it doesn't call for an arms embargo, those are things we do work [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=201.72s)]
*  for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=205.6s)]
*  Even though it doesn't call it a genocide, we still try to capture the massacres that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=206.6s)]
*  are happening. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=209.6s)]
*  But at the same time, we understood this was going to be a moment to show some good faith. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=210.64s)]
*  And so that is what we were going to talk about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=214.96s)]
*  Yeah, that point of the good faith, because I think a lot of the discussion about it I [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  saw was about, well, you know, you don't know what they'll say. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=223.2s)]
*  And I think one argument, which seemed legitimate to me, is like, if a person's not going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=227.0s)]
*  endorse the candidate or they're going to trash the nominee, like, we're not going to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  give them a slot, that seems reasonable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=235.44s)]
*  But I think the point that I'm hearing from you is like, you were willing to go up there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  I want to just read from the part of the speech that's OK with you, because you said this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=240.84s)]
*  in the speech that you released. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=246.92s)]
*  You said, let's commit to each other to electing Vice President Harris and defeating Donald [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=247.92s)]
*  Trump, who used my identity as a Palestinian as a slur. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's fight for the policies long overdue, from restoring access to abortions, to ensuring [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=255.12s)]
*  a living wage, to demanding an end to reckless war and a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=259.44s)]
*  Do you think there was a chance that this would happen? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=266.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, from my understanding, Uncommitted was told that as long as they were not told [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  no, there was a good chance this was going to happen. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=275.11999999999995s)]
*  And so they were asked to submit names. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  And this has been going on for a while. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=280.55999999999995s)]
*  This did not start this week. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  This these negotiations have been ongoing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  And from my understanding, I was basically myself and actually Representative Abdel Nasser, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  who's also a Palestinian in Illinois. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=290.84s)]
*  We were kind of pushed as, OK, you're elected officials, you're Palestinian. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  Surely, surely we can at least focus on the two of you out of the list of many people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=297.4s)]
*  that were already submitted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  And we were already on that list to begin with. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  But it was just one of those, let's focus on them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  And we still don't understand why there wasn't a speaking slot for any Palestinian. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=308.28s)]
*  To be clear, it didn't have to be me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  It didn't have to be Representative Abdel Nasser. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=313.56s)]
*  It could have been any Palestinian. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  And there wasn't a single one. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=317.67999999999995s)]
*  One of the aspects of this that I found a little confounding about that, too, and again, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=319.76s)]
*  like conventions and candidates are going to enforce the discipline of what they want to say. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=323.64s)]
*  And that is how this all works. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=328.56s)]
*  But at this point, it does seem to me that both the bulk of the hostages families, both [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=331.0s)]
*  American and Israeli, the bulk of the bulk of the Israeli public, if you believe polling, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=337.52s)]
*  the bulk of the Israeli security establishment, according to much reporting and higher [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  rates in other places, the bulk of Palestinian Americans all kind of want the same thing, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  which is the levers to produce a ceasefire. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we had organizations, I mean, so many organizations from Ben the Ark to, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  obviously, uncommitted was pushing for this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=365.48s)]
*  We also had members of Congress request this publicly and privately, including Representative [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=366.88s)]
*  Rishid Ali, Representative Cory Bush, Representative Ilhan Omar. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=372.16s)]
*  But also, you know, we had folks like AOC and others who were pushing and saying, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=375.12s)]
*  why is there not a single Palestinian speaker? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And again, the ask wasn't sort of we want anything special or different. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=384.16s)]
*  The idea was if this is going to be a big tent, can we please make sure it includes [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=388.24s)]
*  everybody that we are trying to reach this year? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=391.92s)]
*  I want to read just another if it's OK with you again, I'm reading your own words to you, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  but because I have this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=397.76s)]
*  I'm happy to read them too, sorry. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=398.56s)]
*  No, no, no, I just but I was struck by what you, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  the text was released. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=404.48s)]
*  So you said in this pain, I've witnessed something profound, a beautiful, multi-faith, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=405.44s)]
*  multi-racial, multi-generational coalition rising from despair within our Democratic Party. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  For 320 days, we stood together demanding to enforce our laws on friend and foe alike [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=415.2s)]
*  to reach a ceasefire and the killing of Palestinians, free all the Israeli and Palestinian [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=419.36s)]
*  hostages and begin the difficult work of building a path to collective peace and safety. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=423.52s)]
*  That's why we're here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=427.92s)]
*  Members of the Democratic Party committed to equal rights and dignity for all. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=429.28s)]
*  What we do here echoes around the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=432.64s)]
*  Given the fact that convention's over, what do you see as the next step to? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=435.28s)]
*  I frankly don't know. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=441.36s)]
*  Like I said, I'm a state representative. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=444.56s)]
*  This is sort of not our typical forte. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  And I am in the middle of an election season. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=448.32s)]
*  I am up for a reelection this year. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49EYVxzws&t=450.4s)]
