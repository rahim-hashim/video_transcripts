# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Nov. 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8)
*  In a very crowded field of craven House Republicans, there is one who stands out among the rest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=4.44s)]
*  Now, Mace has managed to become a high-profile member of the Republican House caucus in less [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=6.48s)]
*  than three years on the job. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=10.82s)]
*  And that has a lot less to do with her record or accomplishments than her uncanny ability [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=12.92s)]
*  to find a camera. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=17.0s)]
*  In fact, Nancy Mace does not seem to have any real fixed ideology. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=18.0s)]
*  Instead, it tends to shift in whatever direction the cameras are moving. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=21.56s)]
*  For example, Mace was an early supporter of Donald Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=25.84s)]
*  She even worked on his 2016 campaign. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=28.84s)]
*  But the relationship went sour after Mace criticized his attempted coup and Trump endorsed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=31.64s)]
*  her primary opponent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=36.2s)]
*  The congresswoman reacted with a cringe-worthy media stunt flying up to New York to film [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=38.16s)]
*  this video. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=42.32s)]
*  Hey everyone, Congresswoman Nancy Mace here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=43.32s)]
*  I'm in front of Trump Tower today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=46.32s)]
*  If you want to lose your seat once again in midterm election cycle to Democrats, then [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=48.64s)]
*  my opponent is more than qualified to do just that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=53.32s)]
*  Now Mace's name is rumored to be on the Trump shortlist for vice president, a possibility [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=58.04s)]
*  she calls intriguing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=62.54s)]
*  Then there was the Republican speaker debacle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  Mace joined the very small group of rebels that voted to overthrow her own ally, Kevin [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=66.6s)]
*  McCarthy, citing his lack of action on women's issues, including birth control and abortion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=70.76s)]
*  She promoted all the backlash she received for that vote, sporting a scarlet letter in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=76.06s)]
*  front of the press. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=80.66s)]
*  Nancy Mace then turned around and supported Jim Jordan and later speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=82.24s)]
*  both hardcore opponents of abortion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=86.16s)]
*  But this is all part of her plan, as Jake LaHut explains in this fascinating new profile [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=89.0s)]
*  on the Daily Beast. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=94.2s)]
*  Quote, for Mace, what seems to matter most isn't what kind of attention she gets, just [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=95.2s)]
*  that she's at the center of it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=99.2s)]
*  Jake LaHut is a politics reporter for the Daily Beast and she joins me now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=101.24s)]
*  Jake, you got your hands on some briefing materials that staffers have to sort of give [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=105.0s)]
*  to other staffers about like what the congresswoman likes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=110.72s)]
*  These exist in a lot of office. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=113.64s)]
*  What did you learn from that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=115.32s)]
*  So first I want to give a shout out to my colleague Sam Brody, who has a ton of experience [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=116.32s)]
*  on the Hill and had, you know, a greater familiarity with these. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  But I first heard about this handbook when I was reporting on Nancy Mace inserting herself [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=125.52s)]
*  into the, you know, entirely premature beefsteaks that Trump was having. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=130.84s)]
*  And I really wanted to track it down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=135.92s)]
*  Once we got it, what really stood out to me was that this is really a lot of like consultant [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=137.68s)]
*  buzzwords and kind of vague terms about, you know, what all amount to driving a national [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=143.76s)]
*  narrative. That's the recurring theme throughout it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=151.44s)]
*  The other interesting thing is that the job descriptions for communications related roles [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=154.12s)]
*  tend to be like two or three times longer than, say, the legislative director or the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=159.16s)]
*  deputy chief of staff, you know, really significant positions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=163.92s)]
*  And the third thing that stood out was that no matter what your job title was, and again, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=167.04s)]
*  this was for the handbook this year in 2023, you were required to pitch one tweet a day, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=171.48s)]
*  minimum. And so she sort of had this like all staff writers room dynamic going on. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=178.6s)]
*  And, you know, the goal is just to kind of live new cycle to new cycle. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=185.0s)]
*  And obviously, you're writing a book about the attention economy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=188.32s)]
*  And I think, you know, she's certainly an example of one way to do it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=191.12s)]
*  Put it that way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=194.48s)]
*  Yes, I am. This is up my alley because I'm writing a book on this on this topic. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's very funny to think of like them all sitting around like staff counsel being like, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  all right, I got one, you know, warning, Joe, you know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=203.88s)]
*  So so here's here's the TV hits proportion of the of the handbook staffers on the communications [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  team were told they needed to book Mace on a national TV outlet between one and three times per [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  day per day, a staggering times per week at a minimum, according to former staffers who had [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  seen past handbooks and on local TV channels at least six times a week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  That is a shocking amount of time on TV. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=228.4s)]
*  And I say this as someone who has a TV show. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=230.0s)]
*  Also, she wants to be known as a thought leader, which is a term that that itself is the opposite [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=233.72000000000003s)]
*  of thought in a strategy memo she wrote in twenty twenty one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Mace described herself as the freshman thought leader on federal issues, according to a copy [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=242.96s)]
*  of the Daily Beast. She even gave herself a brand name National Nancy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=247.12s)]
*  Now, she can do this now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=251.24s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, she was in a swing seat and got redistricted into a safe seat. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=252.8s)]
*  Right. So like she could kind of do whatever she wants now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=257.6s)]
*  Is that the deal? I'm so I'm still confused by the status of South Carolina redistricting and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  don't want to speak out of turn there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  But I do think that when the initial redistricting went from swinging to more Trumpy, what I'm not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  sure on is what the future of it is with the core challenges that have happened there and all [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  that. Right. Basically, you know, and I think a member like Elise Stefanik would be a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=277.12s)]
*  comparable where one you realize that where all the small donor energy is, is obviously with the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=281.88s)]
*  MAGA messaging. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=287.28s)]
*  The other thing that I think is just true about our Citizens United era and how small donations [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  have become the name of the game is that you really just want to have that household name, that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=294.08s)]
*  recognizable face and be able to try to just, you know, drawing some donations. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=298.96s)]
*  I think what's different about the recent period we've seen is that she basically torched any [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  goodwill she had left on Capitol Hill by being one of the McCarthy eight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=309.28s)]
*  So I think that's left her in a very precarious position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=313.44s)]
*  And, you know, again, it was it was interesting to hear her say on The Daily Show that she was, you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=316.64s)]
*  know, intrigued by the V.P. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=324.0s)]
*  Speculation as if that was news to her when, again, you know, we reported and have it on pretty good [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=325.76s)]
*  authority that she's basically the only one pushing that around. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=330.32s)]
*  Aside from that ties with Trump adviser Chris LaSavita like that's it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=334.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is by the way, this is a former staffer is talking about that vote to house, which, by the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=339.88s)]
*  way, when I read the part about like staffing up on comms as opposed to legislating, I thought about [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=343.56s)]
*  Madison Cawthorn, who bragged about that famously that he built his staff around comms, not [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=348.2s)]
*  legislating Madison Cawthorn, no longer a member of Congress because he was basically turfed out by [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=352.68s)]
*  Republicans who had enough of his stuff and successfully primaried him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  This is a staffer talking about that vote to House McCarthy, one of eight in the House Republican [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=362.68s)]
*  caucus in the eyes of former staffers. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=366.88s)]
*  She saw the votes on the board and said, F it, I'm just going to vote for it just so I can go on TV [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=368.92s)]
*  and talk about it. A former senior aide said you should write that quote on the gravestone of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=373.76s)]
*  American democracy if it comes to that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  Jake Lahat, great reporting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=386.52s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. Today, America's top diplomat, Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, flew to Israel [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=387.68s)]
*  for a second time in two and a half weeks where he met with Israeli war cabinet. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=392.24s)]
*  That's the new unity government work cabinet. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=396.52s)]
*  And there he called for a humanitarian pause to the conflict in Gaza. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=399.24s)]
*  We need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  We've been clear that as Israel conducts its campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=409.88s)]
*  I've seen images, too, of Palestinian children, young boys and girls pulled from the wreckage of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=415.56s)]
*  buildings. When I see that, when I look into their eyes through the TV screen, I see my own [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=422.88s)]
*  children. How can we not? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=433.56s)]
*  Following those remarks from the U.S. Secretary of State, two things happened. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=437.84s)]
*  In a brief address to the nation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly rejected calls [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=440.68s)]
*  for any kind of humanitarian pause, invoking the more than 200 hostages believed to currently be [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=445.76s)]
*  in Hamas's custody in Gaza. That despite the fact that last week, Israeli's military pointedly did [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=451.2s)]
*  not seem to consider those hostages a strategic priority before their incursion into Gaza. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=456.52s)]
*  The other thing that happened was the Israeli military took credit for bombing an ambulance outside [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=462.32s)]
*  Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=467.12s)]
*  That's Al-Shifa hospital that we've been reporting on throughout the conflict. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=468.56s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry says multiple people were killed and dozens more injured. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=472.44s)]

*  justifying why it believes civilian infrastructure is a legitimate military target. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=481.8s)]
*  The health ministry, which is under the authority of Hamas, denies those allegations. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=487.76s)]
*  According to The Washington Post, quote, the dead and wounded visible in the videos reviewed by the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=492.15999999999997s)]

*  White House's argument for a pause to protect civilians. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=509.04s)]
*  And while the Biden administration has fallen short of calling for a full ceasefire, as some Democratic [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=513.52s)]
*  members of Congress have called for, the call for a pause nonetheless represents a shift, a market one [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=517.6s)]
*  actually, in tone for the White House. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=524.72s)]
*  President Joe Biden has always been a stalwart supporter of Israel, dating all the way back to his time on [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=527.6s)]
*  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it's about time we stop those of us who support, as most of us do, Israel in this body for apologizing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=536.0s)]
*  for our support for Israel. There's no apology to be made, none. It is the best $3 billion investment we make. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=544.4s)]
*  Whether or not in Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=553.36s)]
*  interest in the region. The United States would have to go out and invent an Israel. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=558.72s)]
*  Well, Senator Biden, back in 1986, following the barbaric attacks on October 7th, the president's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=565.36s)]
*  initial instinct was to stand firmly with Israel, both, I believe, out of genuine moral principle. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=571.12s)]
*  It's what he believes, as well as U.S. strategic alliances. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  And the approach that I think President Biden adopted with Benjamin Netanyahu, who he has known for decades [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=581.36s)]
*  and talks about that all the time, is that he would publicly pledge his full support and solidarity to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=586.32s)]
*  the people in Israel, and then behind the scenes, whenever possible, he would try to affect the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=591.2s)]
*  trajectory of Israel's response while maintaining that public posture of unwavering support. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=596.88s)]
*  That was clearly the plan. Now, it is true, as numerous national security officials in the U.S. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=602.0s)]
*  government had said to me, that there is not a single nation on earth that would have experienced [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=607.28s)]
*  the atrocity Israel went through last month and not responded with some kind of military action. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=611.04s)]
*  Israel was always going to do something. And that's particularly true when you consider [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  the ancient foundational trauma of a pogrom, of elicited by the mass slaughter of Jewish men, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  women, and children in a state created to stop such an atrocity. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=630.0s)]
*  But there is the abstract principle of Israel's right to self-defense amid mass atrocity, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=633.92s)]
*  its right to go after the perpetrators of these attacks, which I believe everyone in the U.S. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=639.04s)]
*  government around the world immediately afterwards, many agreed with. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=643.12s)]
*  And then there's the actual government of the state of Israel, the actual government, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=647.52s)]
*  the men and women that will empower the actual politics and many other things that are going on [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=652.16s)]
*  in Israel. Right now, it's a unity government run by Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior to the attacks [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=656.8s)]
*  last month was a hard right government run by Benjamin Netanyahu, considered by many Israelis [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=661.68s)]
*  to be one of the worst, if not the worst, government in the country's history. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=667.68s)]
*  A Netanyahu government that, first of all, at the most basic level, had the worst security state [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=672.4s)]
*  failing of any government in the world. And that was the worst government in the world. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=677.84s)]
*  Worst security state failing of any government in the world since maybe 9-11 and maybe further back. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=682.96s)]
*  A government whose primary military objective prior to these attacks [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=690.72s)]
*  appeared to be pursuing its own ideological goals of settler expansion in the West Bank [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=694.24s)]
*  rather than focusing on national security. It's also a government whose explicit strategy [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=699.04s)]
*  for stopping a Palestinian state was to make sure there was divided regimes between Gaza and the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=704.88s)]
*  West Bank, which meant supporting Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu said that famously at a party meeting [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=709.76s)]
*  of his Al-Lukun party in 2019, according to various reports of people who were there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=716.4s)]
*  Not to mention the fact that Netanyahu himself is also currently under indictment on corruption [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=721.52s)]
*  charges in Israel, charges he denies. And much like Donald Trump, his current attempts to seize [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=726.08s)]
*  and retain power seem inextricably linked to his own self-preservation. That includes his recent [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=731.36s)]
*  effort to basically take over the Israeli courts and remove the lone single independent check [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=737.2s)]
*  on the executive authority in the state of Israel. That power grab led to widespread protests across [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=742.96s)]
*  the country for months, the largest in Israel's history, with Netanyahu quickly becoming something [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=749.2s)]
*  of a pariah among many of his own constituents. Not only this particular law that is being, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  that might pass now, but the line of legislation is going to turn Israel into a, in the best case, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=761.2s)]
*  a hollow democracy, in the worst case, a dictatorship. And none of us Air Force pilots [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=769.44s)]
*  want to serve in an Air Force of a dictatorship. Those concerns of eroding democratic norms were [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=776.32s)]
*  exacerbated by the fact that Netanyahu's current coalition may well be the most right-wing [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=784.08s)]
*  government in the country's history, which has collaborated with some of those fringe, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=788.56s)]
*  vile figures in all of Israeli politics, in some cases even in the highest positions of power. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=793.04s)]
*  Take, for example, Israel's current Minister of Internal Security, that man, a man by the name of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  Ibn Gavir, this is a man that even the Israeli military refused to draft as a teenager over [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=804.0s)]
*  concerns about his extreme far-right views, according to the Times of Israel. Ibn Gavir [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=810.88s)]
*  openly admires a terrorist, a guy named Baruch Goldstein, who perpetrated one of the bloodiest [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=815.6s)]
*  acts of anti-Palestinian terror back in 1994. It's the bloodiest act of violence ever to occur in [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=822.0s)]
*  the occupied territories. A Jewish settler opened fire indiscriminately this morning on Muslim [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  worshippers in a crowded mosque during morning prayers. The settler, identified as an American [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=834.88s)]
*  immigrant, slipped past armed guards at the tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron, a holy site for Jews [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  and Arabs. Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish American who went to Israel, murdered worshippers in that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=845.04s)]
*  mosque. Ibn Gavir and his wife reportedly had their first date at the site of that mass murder's [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  grave, and for years Ibn Gavir had a big laudatory, admiring poster of him, the one you see there, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=860.24s)]
*  in his living room. That picture was considered so offensive, so beyond the pale, that even other [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=866.64s)]
*  far-right politicians in Israel wouldn't stand for it. He was effectively barred from joining [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=875.52s)]
*  the current government, literally unless he took the picture down. And under enormous pressure, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=880.2399999999999s)]
*  Ibn Gavir agreed to take the picture down in a self-pitying social media post. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  That guy, Ibn Gavir, he's still in power. In fact, he's ordering at least 10,000 guns [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=889.04s)]
*  to arm Israeli settlers in the West Bank, settlers who have only stepped up markedly their [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=896.4s)]
*  campaign of violence, intimidation, and terror against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=901.92s)]
*  who have nothing to do with Hamas, since the October 7th attacks, as reported by Sky News in this package. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=906.64s)]
*  They've lived here for generations, but they've decided enough is enough, and the entire population [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=912.64s)]
*  of the West Bank village of Zanota is moving. They have no choice. Israeli settlers have harassed [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  them and threatened them. Now they're being told by the Israeli defense forces that they have a week [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=922.0s)]
*  to leave. A whole village of Palestinians forcibly ejected from their homes by Israeli settlers. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=927.9200000000001s)]

*  Israelis, are very concerned about exacerbating tensions in the West Bank, about opening another [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=942.72s)]
*  front when Israel is in this incredibly perilous situation. But this is a coalition government [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  where some of the far-right members believe fundamentally all of Israel is theirs, that the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=954.88s)]
*  enduring state they look for openly, they say this, is one in which Jews control all of greater [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=959.36s)]
*  Israel, including the West Bank, and they just keep Palestinians occupied in sedates. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=965.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not the abstract principle of the right to self-defense or reacting to atrocity. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=974.24s)]
*  There are real people in a government making real decisions. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=979.04s)]
*  So when Secretary of State Antony Blinken shows up and calls for restraint, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9y0b8Jl7q8&t=983.68s)]
