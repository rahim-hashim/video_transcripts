# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o)
*  We have now proved something pretty phenomenal and at the same time pretty obscene. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=0.0s)]
*  And what we've proved is that poverty for children in America is not some accident. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=8.0s)]
*  It's a policy choice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=15.0s)]
*  This moral obscenity of the richest nation in the world having the highest poverty rates is not an accident. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=20.0s)]
*  It's not destiny. It's not inevitability. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=26.0s)]
*  It is people in this institution making a policy choice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=30.0s)]
*  People who made that choice to plunge millions of American children back into poverty are every single Senate Republican plus Democrat Joe Manchin who refused to extend the child tax credit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=36.0s)]
*  Today, Manchin is defending that decision. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=47.0s)]
*  Speaking to Semaphore, Manchin quote, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=49.0s)]
*  He told them, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=54.0s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker is a Democrat of New Jersey and he joins me now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=61.0s)]
*  First, let me just get your reaction. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=66.0s)]
*  Everyone was bracing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=68.0s)]
*  The people in the world of policy on this were bracing for what this number was going to be. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=70.0s)]
*  And what was your reaction to seeing it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=75.0s)]
*  Not surprised. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=78.0s)]
*  We knew what we had done and we're talking about child poverty tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=80.0s)]
*  Know that this was the biggest middle class tax cut in our lifetime, Chris. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=83.0s)]
*  So this was giving 85 to 90 percent of families in New Jersey tax breaks more of their federal tax dollars back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=90.0s)]
*  So this was an extraordinary program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=97.0s)]
*  And by the way, it mirrors what our industrial competitors have. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=100.0s)]
*  They keep their child poverty rates a lot lower because what they often call a child allowance is higher. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=103.0s)]
*  America is the one that chooses to put such a financial strain on families holding a lot of their tax dollars. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=108.0s)]
*  Now, this was a great program because it made it fully refundable, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=115.0s)]
*  which basically means if you didn't earn enough money to pay that level of federal taxes, you still got that anyway. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=119.0s)]
*  And so it lifted millions of Americans' children out of poverty and helped so many struggling families [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=125.0s)]
*  who are still trying to figure out ways to make their kitchen table economics work. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=131.0s)]
*  So this is outrageous that in this country we are favoring other kind of tax expenditures. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=136.0s)]
*  Carried interest is something you've talked about a lot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=142.0s)]
*  For the wealthiest folks, we have a lot of little tax loopholes or tax breaks that we give them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=145.0s)]
*  But when it comes to something that is in the national interest, like raising children above poverty line, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=151.0s)]
*  because it literally saves our economy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=157.0s)]
*  For every dollar you invest in lifting a child above the poverty line, you save over $5 for our economy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=160.0s)]
*  because children, unfortunately, below the poverty line have higher health care costs, have lower lifetime productivity and the like. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=165.0s)]
*  There's just no justification whatsoever for allowing this policy to lapse. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to pull that graphic up again because it's so stark, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=176.0s)]
*  You don't get signals amidst the noise this often in any policy discussion, right, where you have like, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=180.0s)]
*  oh, there's a bunch of confounding variables and what really caused this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=185.0s)]
*  This is just, there was a policy, it gave 80% of households with children money, it was near universal, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=188.0s)]
*  child poverty plummeted, now it has gone back up. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=194.0s)]
*  Here's my question about the political economy of this, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=197.0s)]
*  and I want to ask you a question about the sort of moral insight that you had there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=199.0s)]
*  On the political economy, there was hope that this would be one of those things of how could you take it away, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=203.0s)]
*  If you did it for a year, you know, Manchin didn't want to do it for more than that, let's see what happens. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=208.0s)]
*  There would just be the kind of political energy behind it that would be impossible for anyone to vote to let it lapse. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=214.0s)]
*  And yet that happened. What did you learn from that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=220.0s)]
*  You know, it was a hard lesson. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=223.0s)]
*  A lot of folks said that once we get it out the door, we'll get it, we'll see this almost 50% cut in child poverty. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=225.0s)]
*  All Americans, at least upwards of 80 to 90%, will see a benefit from it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=231.0s)]
*  But amidst a lot of the pandemic stimulus checks and a lot of the other things that were going on, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=236.0s)]
*  I saw a lot of data that a lot of folks didn't know what it was or who was responsible for it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=242.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure if it developed the kind of political constituency, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=248.0s)]
*  obviously should have right now in a time of inflation and tight family economics. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think also, I mean, my own theory on this is that because it was part, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=258.0s)]
*  there was a lot of COVID programs that were happening that people understood as temporary as opposed to, you know, longstanding. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=262.0s)]
*  So I think that probably obscured things a little bit. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=269.0s)]
*  Joe Manchin is really, I mean, again, I don't want to take the pressure off the Republicans [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=271.0s)]
*  because they uniformly and unanimously voted against this, even, you know, Mitt Romney or whoever your favorite Republican senator is. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=275.0s)]
*  Joe Manchin is the decider ultimately because he was with you guys on the first year and not the second year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=282.0s)]
*  West Virginia's got one of the worst child poverty rates in the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=289.0s)]
*  Have you had conversations about this with him? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=292.0s)]
*  You know, this has been about six of us, three House members, three senators, Sherrod Brown, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=295.0s)]
*  Michael Bennett that have been working on this for years and years and years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=300.0s)]
*  So, of course, I had a lot of conversations with Joe Manchin, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=303.0s)]
*  as well as some Republicans about the urgency of this policy, the fiscal prudence of this policy, the moral urgency of this policy, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=307.0s)]
*  but was not able to get anywhere. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=317.0s)]
*  And now, by the way, we have data from this one year that's extraordinary, including just the brain development of children. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=319.0s)]
*  You could see it affected because children in poverty have a lot of cortisol pumping, a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=327.0s)]
*  and it literally affects the way their brains develop. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=333.0s)]
*  So we have a lot of compelling data. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=336.0s)]
*  I have not given up, nor has the sort of six of us that are fighting for this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=338.0s)]
*  And we're going to continue to try it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=343.0s)]
*  And one of the things we're going to say is often at the end of years, they try to pass these big corporate tax extenders. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=345.0s)]
*  And I know extender time in Washington. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=351.0s)]
*  Yes. That's when K Street goes to town. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=354.0s)]
*  Yes. And a lot of us, therefore, have a lot of leverage in the Senate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=357.0s)]
*  And, you know, our team, we're going to prioritize children and not just lifting children out of poverty. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=360.0s)]
*  This is going to help tens of millions of families with children have less financial stress. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=366.0s)]
*  And the stories about what people were using it for, helping kids get athletic equipment, paying rent, utility bills, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=371.0s)]
*  food was the biggest thing people were using it for to feed their children. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=378.0s)]
*  This is what we should want. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=382.0s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker, who has been working on this for a long time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=384.0s)]
*  I've followed it, reported. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=388.0s)]
*  I know Michael Bennett and Chair Brown III, you particularly have been particularly invested. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=390.0s)]
*  I hope this isn't the end of the road. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=393.0s)]
*  I actually think this is not going away. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=395.0s)]
*  So we're going to stay on this as well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah. Martin Luther King said child poverty is moral violence, violence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=400.0s)]
*  And it really is. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=406.0s)]
*  So I just I have faith in our nation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=407.0s)]
*  But thanks to you and others talking about this policy that a lot of people don't know what child tax credit is, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=409.0s)]
*  I want more people to know about it and more people beginning to demand that we do it again. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=415.0s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Senator. Appreciate it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=419.0s)]
*  I spent my last 25 years in public service of one kind or another. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=423.0s)]
*  At the end of another term, I'd be in my mid 80s. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=428.0s)]
*  Frankly, it's time for a new generation of leaders. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=432.0s)]
*  They're the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=437.0s)]
*  Today, that man, Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, announced he would not run for reelection [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=442.0s)]
*  and would step down when his term expires in January 2025. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=447.0s)]
*  And thus will end the political career of a man who has, to my mind, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=451.0s)]
*  has to my mind, improbably become one of the most fascinating political figures of our times. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=455.0s)]
*  Romney is in the twilight, as you said, of his political career. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=461.0s)]
*  And he staked out a non-MAGA Republican position after he was elected in 2018, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=464.0s)]
*  spending his Senate term as basically a relatively normal, conscientious, non-Trump conservative. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=469.0s)]
*  That itself undersells just how freakishly rare such a stance was. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=476.0s)]
*  He was basically the only one. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=481.0s)]
*  And now he's taking no prisoners on his way out by way of a forthcoming tell-all biography [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=483.0s)]
*  written by McCabe Coppins, who was given extraordinary access to the Senator and his files, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=488.0s)]
*  including journals and diaries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=493.0s)]
*  Excerpts were published from that book today in The Atlantic, and in them Romney recounts several stories, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=495.0s)]
*  including during the investigation that led to Donald Trump's first impeachment, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=500.0s)]
*  when then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told Trump to stop attacking Romney on Twitter. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=504.0s)]
*  And he wrote, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=509.0s)]
*  You're lucky, McConnell continued, you can say the things we all think. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=511.0s)]
*  You're in a position to say things about him we all agree with but can't say. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=517.0s)]
*  Tim Miller is a former spokesman for the RNC and former communications director for Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=521.0s)]
*  He's now a writer at Larif the Bullwork, where he wrote today about Romney's announcement. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=527.0s)]
*  You're shaking your head because it's like, what I found... [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=531.0s)]
*  This, by the way, the excerpt's amazing. I think the book's going to be phenomenal. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=533.0s)]
*  But I found fascinating about it. Again, it was a little like when Jack Smith charged Trump. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=537.0s)]
*  Just the like, I'm not crazy. Like, obviously the people up close to Donald Trump look at the guy and think, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=543.0s)]
*  This guy should not be president. Of course he shouldn't be president. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=550.0s)]
*  And Mitt Romney just saying, yes, behind closed doors, that's what they all say, was not surprising. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=553.0s)]
*  But there was something like, water is wet, two plus two equals four about it, for me. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=560.0s)]
*  For sure. First I just have to say, it just caught me off guard when I heard him say that he'd be in his mid-80s again. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, the milk, there's something about the milk diet, you know, because Romney looks great. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=572.0s)]
*  He sure does. He's got some picture of himself in an attic. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=576.0s)]
*  And the thing that was like, shaking my head a half there was Mitch McConnell saying, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=579.0s)]
*  You're saying the things that we can't say. But that's wrong, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=582.0s)]
*  Like, Mitt is saying the things that they won't say, that they're unwilling to say. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=586.0s)]
*  And not really very many people tried to say them and survive. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=590.0s)]
*  You know, I always said to the Republican politicians that still called me, that's a dwindling number. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=595.0s)]
*  But the ones who did, I was like, you don't have to be me. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=600.0s)]
*  You don't have to go on Chris Hayes and just troll Trump and every possible opportunity. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=602.0s)]
*  But you just have to do the right things at the right time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=607.0s)]
*  You have to convict him when he tries a coup. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=610.0s)]
*  You have to speak out when he's saying that we should send American black women back where they came from. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=612.0s)]
*  That's all. That was the minimum bar we were asking for. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=618.0s)]
*  And for some reason, Mitt Romney was the only one that stood over it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=623.0s)]
*  And so I think it's sad that he's leaving for that reason. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=626.0s)]
*  That's the other thing about Romney that I find fascinating. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=628.0s)]
*  Again, every time that he would talk about like things in the parameters of normal politics, almost not every time, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=631.0s)]
*  but often I'd be like, No, you're wrong, dude. I wouldn't like them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=637.0s)]
*  Things he said about the deficit, about the child tax cut, about abortion. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=641.0s)]
*  Like, I disagree with it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=644.0s)]
*  But it was like you are recognizably in a small D sense, a Democrat, meaning committed to the project of American democracy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=646.0s)]
*  Like you, you're on the same team of like, we want this thing to continue and not feeling like you have that faith in other members of the party is what's so scary about these times to me. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=655.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the turnover, right? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=666.0s)]
*  Like the more these people leave, you know, they're going to be replaced by uglier and uglier folks. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=669.0s)]
*  You know, just in Utah, there was actually a house prior. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=674.0s)]
*  Didn't get a lot of attention where there was one kind of Romney shot, maybe even a little more moderate, frankly, a candidate. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=676.0s)]
*  And it was a three way race that she almost kind of luckily stuck through just because of the nature of the primary. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=682.0s)]
*  But she did end up with this super mega. That is what is going to happen again. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=687.0s)]
*  And so, you know, Romney and I think even viewers who are very progressive, very liberal, like the other thing that Romney did when he got in there is he was serious about governing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=692.0s)]
*  Yes, small D democracy. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=700.0s)]
*  It's used to have governing. He, he did work with Joe Biden and with Democrats on, you know, maybe not the child tax credit. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=701.0s)]
*  I'm with you. He probably should have. But on infrastructure chips on the gun reform bill on the electoral count act. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=708.0s)]
*  But like this is like again, what should be the minimum of what we want from our from our legislators. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=716.0s)]
*  But there are just so few of them left. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=722.0s)]
*  He's also a contrast to another person, I think, who who sort of holds himself out in similar fashion, I think, to Mitt Romney in some ways as a man of integrity of a man of devout belief, which is Mike Pence. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=725.0s)]
*  Romney says this about Pence in the book and in the excerpt. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=734.0s)]
*  He long been put up by Pence's pious brand of Trump sycophancy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=738.0s)]
*  No one, he told me, had been more loyal, more willing to smile when he saw absurdities, more willing to ascribe God's will to things that were ungodly than Mike Pence, which is a pretty good turn of phrase. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=742.0s)]
*  And here's what it got. Mike Pence. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=752.0s)]
*  Take a look at Mike Pence on the campaign trail today. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=754.0s)]
*  I think this is in Iowa and decor. I take a look. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=757.0s)]
*  Mike Pence, we need to get the fuck out of our country. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=761.0s)]
*  I need to get the fuck out of Iowa. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=767.0s)]
*  I'm going to put him down as maybe you, but. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=769.0s)]
*  Mike Pence, who is sort of despised across the political spectrum and has the lowest favorabilities. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=774.0s)]
*  It's a pretty good line there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=780.0s)]
*  But Pence and Romney are really fascinating contrast because they do have some root in some thing that we used to see as kind of religiously imbued conservatism. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=782.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the contrast is in two ways, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=793.0s)]
*  I thought that Mitt put it better than I could of all the reasons why Mike Pence doesn't deserve the credit that he does, despite doing the right thing on one day just because of the level of sycophancy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=795.0s)]
*  But the other interesting thing, I think in its comments in the Atlantic Internet video, he still is saying that he Mitt Romney believes in these more traditional conservative values, these old classically small liberal values. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=805.0s)]
*  But he's also saying he thinks that a big part of the Republican Party is actively hostile to them and anti-constitution. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=817.0s)]
*  Whereas Mike Pence is thought they're kind of saying we can still fight for this. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=823.0s)]
*  And I think that's another just reality check difference that that's on the right side of. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=826.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tim Miller, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=830.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on The Chris Hayes Show. We always like that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEChXBSK2o&t=833.0s)]
