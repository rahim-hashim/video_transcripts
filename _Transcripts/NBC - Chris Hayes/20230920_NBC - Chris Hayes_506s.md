# ‘It’s not polling, it’s real’: Dems overperform in 24 of 30 special elections so far in 2023
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and I want to start with some news tonight that is not in the headlines. You probably won't see anywhere else. In fact, it may not even cross your radar screen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, most of the political dialogue has been focused on the national polls and a lot of hand wringing among Democrats over President Joe Biden's reelection chances. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=9.0s)]
*  We actually just had last night two elections. Last night, real people actually voted. They went to polling places and cast their ballots in two different states. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=17.0s)]
*  And I submit there is a strong case to be made that those results last night tell us way more about the state of our democracy and the political strength of the pro-democracy forces in this country than all of today's other political headlines put together. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=26.0s)]
*  So one of those races was in Western Pennsylvania to fill an open state house seat in District 21. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=40.0s)]
*  Now this special election was key because it would decide which party controls the narrowly divided Pennsylvania state house. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=49.0s)]
*  The Democratic candidate, 32-year-old Lindsay Powell, won as expected in the heavily Democratic district. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=55.0s)]
*  But here's the thing to pay attention to. Her margin of victory was even better than expected. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=62.0s)]
*  The district she's running in, the 21st district, is 17 percentage points more Democratic, more or less, than the country as a whole. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=67.0s)]
*  If last night's results hold, Lindsay Powell will have won by 30 points. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=75.0s)]
*  That is what we call an overperformance of 13 points, that D plus 13. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=80.0s)]
*  Also last night, there was another special election, this one in a very, very different kind of district. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=86.0s)]
*  This was in New Hampshire. And to me, this is an even more interesting and more representative story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=91.0s)]
*  In this district, House District 1, it's a Republican-leaning area. It's near the capital of Concord. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=96.0s)]
*  It narrowly went for Donald Trump in 2020. That's a Trump district. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=102.0s)]
*  It leans six points further to the right than the nationwide average. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=105.0s)]
*  But yesterday, Democrat Hal Rafter defeated an extreme, MAGA Republican by 12 points, making for a whopping 18 points swing to the left. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=110.0s)]
*  Now, to be fair, let's be clear here. This is a tiny district. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=120.0s)]
*  The New Hampshire state house notoriously is enormous. It has 400 members, each representing about 3,300 people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=124.0s)]
*  This is a small sample. It's a little glimpse into the ginormous landscape of this country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=130.0s)]
*  But the really important thing to understand and the reason I am leading tonight's show with this news is that this is not an isolated incident. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=135.0s)]
*  In fact, it's part of what continues to be one of the most surprising and reliable political trends of the last few years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=143.0s)]
*  And this trend has done a much better job of telling us where the pulse of the nation really is than a lot of polling. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=152.0s)]
*  And certainly a lot of the political discourse. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=158.0s)]
*  Remember the context here as I speak to you in the fall of 2023. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=161.0s)]
*  Last year around this time, right, run up to the midterms, almost everyone in the political media believed the Democrats were going to be shellacked. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=166.0s)]
*  The conventional wisdom, again, not crazy, was that Joe Biden and his party were focusing on the wrong things. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=175.0s)]
*  They were talking too much about abortion and about democracy, not enough on inflation and kitchen table issues. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=181.0s)]
*  And voters just had enough. Democrats were going to lose control of the House and the Senate. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=187.0s)]
*  And it was going to be a red wave. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=193.0s)]
*  Be an analyst for a second. Does it feel like a red wave? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=197.0s)]
*  It feels like a red wave, Brian. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=200.0s)]
*  You know, your predictions of a red wave are accurate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=202.0s)]
*  So I met a surfboard said the red wave is coming. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=205.0s)]
*  Red wave rising. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=207.0s)]
*  That red wave that I'm convinced is coming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=209.0s)]
*  The reports I'm seeing show a big red wave coming. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=211.0s)]
*  Sleepy Joe just guaranteed a red wave in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=215.0s)]
*  Democrats are bracing for the worst case scenario. A red tsunami. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=217.0s)]
*  We are officially on a red tsunami watch. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=221.0s)]
*  Of course, then election night came and the folks at Fox News and a lot of the political world was shocked. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=224.0s)]
*  Instead of a red tsunami, Joe Biden and Democrats pulled off the best midterm performance for an incumbent president in a quarter century. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=230.0s)]
*  If you're a Republican, things are really not looking very good for you right now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=240.0s)]
*  First of all, you underperformed all of these expectations of a red wave or some sort of big, big victory. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=244.0s)]
*  It just didn't happen. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=252.0s)]
*  This wasn't even a red wave. It's not even a red little ripple in a pond. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=254.0s)]
*  Everything lined up for Republicans yet you see them underperforming the way they did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=258.0s)]
*  The only red wave this season is going to be a German Shepherd commander knocks over the cranberry sauce on our table. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=263.0s)]
*  Whoever wrote that joke. Nice one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=270.0s)]
*  Now, nobody saw it coming, but I submit that they could have. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=272.0s)]
*  At least in retrospect, it's clear there were some real indicators. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=277.0s)]
*  And one of the most important was looking at how Democrats were doing in special elections. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=280.0s)]
*  The trend emerged in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=287.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, Democrats were overperforming in special election after special election all over the country in Republican areas and in Democratic areas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=292.0s)]
*  It began last September last summer with Nebraska, Minnesota and New York. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=300.0s)]
*  And the story continued all through this year. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=304.0s)]
*  The folks at 538 compiled this chart, 30 different special elections so far in 2023. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=308.0s)]
*  These are all different districts, legislative state districts all over the country. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=313.0s)]
*  Again, in areas with different profiles, demographically, different politics. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=318.0s)]
*  When you look through this list, you see Democrats overperforming their baseline over and over and over again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=323.0s)]
*  In fact, that is the case in 24 out of these 30 races. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=331.0s)]
*  Now, in some instances where you see these big Democratic swings, the Republican candidate still won the election, but they won by a lot less than you would expect. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=335.0s)]
*  Look at one of the first special elections of the year. It's in Virginia's 24th House District. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=344.0s)]
*  The Republican won resoundingly by 25 points, but that was a 14 point underperformance for the party. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=348.0s)]
*  Or look at Pennsylvania's 35th House District. Democrat won by 49 points, overperforming for the district by 37. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=355.0s)]
*  Even in Kentucky, the Democrats swung Senate District 19 29 points to the left. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=362.0s)]
*  And we've seen it in Georgia and in Wisconsin, in New York, in Louisiana, in Maine and Tennessee. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=368.0s)]
*  The combined average of all 30 of these races, again, a somewhat random sample of the country, shows Democrats overperforming the baseline margin by 11 points. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=375.0s)]
*  This is a real phenomenon. It's really there. It's not polling. It's real. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=386.0s)]
*  It represents what you might even cheekily call the silent majority. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=392.0s)]
*  Folks showing up to register their preference in the only polls that really matter. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=397.0s)]
*  It's the silent majority that showed up in 2020, propelling Joe Biden to victory with a margin of more than seven million votes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=402.0s)]
*  It's the silent majority that also showed up in contested districts and contested statewide races across the country to reject extreme Trump-aligned candidates like Blake Masters, and Curry Lake, and Arizona, and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=408.0s)]
*  It's the same silent majority that showed up last night on a random Tuesday in September. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=423.0s)]
*  Right? Like there's not usually an election. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=430.0s)]
*  And they showed up in New Hampshire and they showed up in Pennsylvania to vote for center left pro-democracy candidates. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=434.0s)]
*  That says something robust and inspiring about where we stand at this moment nearing another presidential election year. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=442.0s)]
*  Of course, you know, I know we were made in a very polarized country. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=452.0s)]
*  And the threat to democracy in the person of Donald Trump and the faction he represents and the forces that he's channeling is real and it is terrifying. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=455.0s)]
*  But if you feel that way, you are not alone. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=464.0s)]
*  When you stand in the pro-democracy coalition, remember, you are in the majority. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=469.0s)]
*  You are with those folks you've never met who don't write about politics for a living and who are out there showing up for special elections on a Tuesday night in September to vote in line with those values. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=473.0s)]
*  . [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGweHQ2t4s&t=503.0s)]
