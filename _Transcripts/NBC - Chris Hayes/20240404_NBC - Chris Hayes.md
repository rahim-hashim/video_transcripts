# Trump walking around with ‘Bribe Me’ sign on his neck, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI)
*  Donald Trump's financial situation is not quite as desperate as it was just two weeks ago when he was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=0.0s)]
*  scrounging around the couch cushions for half a billion dollars to cover the bond in his New York civil fraud case. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=5.28s)]
*  He still squeezed and vulnerable and basically walking around with a big bribe me sign hanging around his neck. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Remember Trump wriggled out of that immediate peril in New York after an appellate court knocked down the bond amount by more than 60% [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=16.8s)]
*  and gave him a 10 extra days to figure it out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=23.56s)]
*  Before that ruling, which came without any real rationale to be honest, Trump was in danger of having his assets seized. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=27.04s)]
*  If he did not post this bond, New York attorney general Letitia James could take possession of some of his multimillion dollar properties, which span several states. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=34.4s)]
*  Just in the nick of time, though, Donald Trump found a billionaire benefactor to come to his rescue. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=43.6s)]
*  This is Don Hankey, an 80 year old California businessman worth more than seven billion dollars. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=48.56s)]
*  Hankey owns an auto services empire that includes a real estate firm, an auto insurance company and a rental car company. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=54.16s)]
*  But his real claim to fame and fortune is as the king of subprime car loans. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=60.16s)]
*  We had cases where people would come into our lot to buy a used car or a new car and they'd have poor credit, but they had a good down payment. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=66.8s)]
*  So we decided to carry our own paper. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=74.56s)]
*  And so buy here, pay here is what it's called. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=76.56s)]
*  So if somebody had three thousand dollars and we had a car that maybe we're in four thousand, we get three thousand dollars down from them, sell the car for six thousand and then we would collect. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=80.0s)]
*  They're receivable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's nice work. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=93.6s)]
*  And you can get it to be clear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=94.88s)]
*  These kinds of loans are people with low credit scores who desperately need a car for their lives to get to work. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=96.0s)]
*  They don't have quite enough cash up front. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  So what they do is they end up paying usurious interest rates like you just heard and very high fees. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=104.8s)]
*  And perhaps not surprisingly, that turns out to be an incredibly profitable business. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=110.56s)]
*  It catapulted Don Hankey to number one hundred and twenty eight on Forbes most recent list of the richest people in America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=115.28s)]
*  A position he certainly seems to enjoy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=121.52s)]
*  I think I can live without a large boat. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=124.56s)]
*  I had I had a boat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=126.8s)]
*  I can't live without big houses. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=127.84s)]
*  What I really love to have is a nice view wherever I am, I think, and technology for the last few years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=129.52s)]
*  I've been getting picked up in the morning and taken home in a Mercedes Maubach. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, Hankey told The Washington Post that it was his wife, Debbie's idea to use their fortune to help Donald Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=143.44s)]
*  They first reached out to Trump's team to negotiate a deal before a court reduced the bond. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  And Trump said he had the cash to post it himself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=153.36s)]
*  Then, to his surprise, the Trump team last week revived the talks and asked Hankey if he would back the new amount. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=156.16s)]
*  Hankey promptly agreed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=162.32s)]
*  He is in the subprime loan business after all, saying that his company is charging Trump a, quote, modest fee, which he declined to disclose. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=164.32s)]
*  Hankey says he's been a Trump supporter, quote, but wouldn't consider himself a major supporter. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  While he's never spoken directly to the former president, he did receive a call from Trump's son, Eric, thanking him for posting the bond. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=177.2s)]
*  So, you don't know for sure why Don Hankey decided to do this. He's got a lot of money. He likes Donald Trump. Maybe that's enough of a reason. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=183.6s)]
*  Hankey told The New York Times, quote, I looked at it as business, number one. And number two, I was happy to help someone, which is sweet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=190.0s)]
*  What do you think would happen if Donald Trump gets back in the Oval Office where he would make appointments to the federal agencies that regulate [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=197.12s)]
*  subprime auto loans or if legislation comes up that would seek to rein them in or regulate them? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=203.28s)]
*  Don Hankey just put up $175 million of Donald Trump. He saved Trump from the humiliation of admitting he did not have the cash of having his property seized. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=209.04s)]
*  What do you think would happen when Hankey needs a favorable or favorable policy from a Trump administration? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=219.04s)]
*  Again, this is just one example of the, let's say, shady interest capitalizing on Donald Trump's financial insecurity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=224.64s)]
*  Tomorrow, the LIV Golf Miami tournament begins at Trump's Doral Golf Course. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=231.92s)]
*  LIV is an upstart league sponsored by Saudi Arabia's Sovereign Wealth Fund, essentially a kind of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=237.28s)]
*  influence operation controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=242.72s)]
*  While Trump Organization executives said the direct payments from LIV were relatively small, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  the tournament itself is, of course, a boon for the business. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Occupancy is way up at the resort where the asking price for hotel rooms more than doubled as the event approached. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=256.22s)]
*  Private chalets to watch the tournament are rented out for up to $89,000. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=262.32s)]
*  We've got new reporting that Donald Trump recently spoke with the Saudi leader. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=267.12s)]
*  Remember, Trump already led a slavishly pro-Saudi administration. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=270.72s)]
*  The Gulf state was in fact his very first international trip as president, which is unheard of. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=274.64s)]
*  And since he left office, this foreign actor, again, the one that murdered a Washington Post columnist, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=280.16s)]
*  with specific material interests in front of the United States government, has been throwing money at him and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=286.48s)]
*  On top of all of that, new reporting from the Guardian reveals that Trump's social media company, which is another big sort of like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=294.48s)]
*  bribe-me stand, which just went public, had actually been kept afloat in 2022 by emergency loans [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=300.46s)]
*  provided in part by a Russian-American businessman under scrutiny in a federal insider trading and money laundering investigation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=306.56s)]
*  So there's another figure with money who presumably now is the ear of the guy who may be running government this time next year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=314.64s)]
*  Look, Trump already led the most flagrantly corrupt administration, I think in U.S. history, at least in recent memory, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=322.08s)]
*  the first time around. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  But now he is under significant financial stress, again, personally and also politically. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=331.76s)]
*  He's open for business with just about anyone willing to shove money in his pocket, no matter what kind of favors [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=336.64s)]
*  they may come knocking for [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=341.52s)]
*  if he becomes the next president. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA6zPBbQeVI&t=343.35999999999996s)]
