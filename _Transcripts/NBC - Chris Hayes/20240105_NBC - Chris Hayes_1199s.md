# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 4
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. In the last 24 hours, more than a thousand pages of newly unsealed documents from a case involving the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein were released to the public. They were unsealed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=0.0s)]
*  That includes about 300 in just the past few hours, which we've been sifting through here. And journalists both in our news organization and all over have been pouring over those documents. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=14.0s)]
*  And I have to say, so far we've not learned much that we did not already know, despite the tantalizing promise there would be some big reveal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=23.0s)]
*  For instance, we know that Epstein actively cultivated relationships with powerful men and in some cases women in prominent institutions from government to finance to academia to philanthropy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=30.0s)]
*  We know that Epstein trafficked and sexually abused young women and girls. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=41.0s)]
*  We know he owned a private island in the Caribbean where some of this abuse took place and that he flew some of those same rich men he cultivated relationships with there on his private jet. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=46.0s)]
*  But the lack of some big bombshell revelation in the new documents has not stopped Fox News and others in right wing media from going absolutely all in on this story. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=56.0s)]
*  And while information on Epstein and the horrible things he did to his victims is absolutely newsworthy, we've covered it on the show quite a bit. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=68.0s)]
*  The extent to which Jeffrey Epstein has become a kind of totem among a certain sort of conspiratorial right wing politics is both fascinating and quite instructive to me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=76.0s)]
*  To some on the right, Jeffrey Epstein is the skeleton key that unlocks the Illuminati and the secret cabal of child sex traffickers that the proverbial they don't want you to know about. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=90.0s)]
*  And with that comes a host of cascading associated conspiracies about everything from vaccines to cell phone towers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=101.0s)]
*  And to be quite clear here, it really is the case that Jeffrey Epstein was a mesh in the upper echelons of American society in a totally disgusting and shameful way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=108.0s)]
*  That reality, though, is sort of the bedrock for what's built atop it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=118.0s)]
*  And that is built atop it is an obsession with him that has transcended those basic facts in a way that gets tied up with a whole number of other right wing fever dreams. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=125.0s)]
*  They actually saw just a perfect example this couple days ago when Aaron Rodgers, the broken down NFL quarterback and vaccine conspiracy peddler, went on an ESPN program that he's paid to go on and baselessly smeared late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as one of Epstein's associates. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=135.0s)]
*  It's got something to do with the Epstein list that came out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=154.0s)]
*  Feels like it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=157.0s)]
*  Feels like it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=158.0s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=159.0s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=161.0s)]
*  Look at this guy. He's been waiting in his wine cellar. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=162.0s)]
*  I've been waiting in my wine cellar for this thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=164.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, that are really hoping that doesn't happen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=166.0s)]
*  Please. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=171.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=173.0s)]
*  All right. Obviously a clip from this particular program was run on Jimmy Kimmel's show whenever Aaron brought up the list and then Jimmy mocked him for it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=174.0s)]
*  Aaron has not forgotten about that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=184.0s)]
*  But here we are sitting right in front of that nice bottle of scotch. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=186.0s)]
*  What do you say? I'm waiting to celebrate something. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=189.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=191.0s)]
*  He's been waiting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=192.0s)]
*  That's the one. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=193.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=194.0s)]
*  If that list comes out, I definitely will be popping some sort of bottle. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=196.0s)]
*  Right. So you get that right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=200.0s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers, who's sort of deep in this conspiracist world, who's done incredible amounts of actual tangible damage with his vaccine denialism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=202.0s)]
*  I mean, huge amounts, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=209.0s)]
*  Sitting there like this big moment, this big reveal, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=210.0s)]
*  The secret cabal is going to be revealed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=213.0s)]
*  And maybe Jimmy Kimmel's on the list. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=216.0s)]
*  Now, Jimmy Kimmel did not appreciate being smeared in that way. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=218.0s)]
*  The late night host, who we must stress has zero connection to Epstein, was not in the documents released, lit into Rogers on social media and threatened to take him to court. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=222.0s)]
*  And the very next day, the host of that program had to go on TV and try to clean up Aaron Rodgers mess. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=232.0s)]
*  I can see exactly why Jimmy Kimmel felt the way he felt, especially with his position. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=239.0s)]
*  But I think Aaron was just trying to talk now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=243.0s)]
*  Did it go too far? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=245.0s)]
*  And a lot of people, Jimmy Kimmel certainly said that was the case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=246.0s)]
*  We and I immediately potted happening, trying to be like, you know, but that is Aaron and Jimmy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=250.0s)]
*  But that is just one example of the way that Epstein conspiracies are sort of weaponized, this kind of all purpose tool against the conspiratorial rights perceived enemies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=255.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=269.0s)]
*  And I have to say it is really just so unbelievable that Fox News, Republicans conserves have made Jeffrey Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein, the focal point of their worldview about who the bad guys are in society. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=270.0s)]
*  Because let's just look at the facts here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=282.0s)]
*  The guy in American politics, most closely associated with Epstein and particularly Epstein's scandals, is, I think, inarguably Donald Trump. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=285.0s)]
*  Back in 2019, when Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking charges, there was renewed interest in his past misdeeds, including crucially that he had been nailed for this before and had pled guilty in 2008 for what prosecutors called soliciting an underage prostitute. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=297.0s)]
*  But it was that subsequent, that sweetheart deal that Epstein received as a result that became an issue. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=313.0s)]
*  The highly unusual plea agreement allowed billionaire hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein to spend a mere 13 months in county jail when the federal government may have had enough evidence to put him in prison for life. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=321.0s)]
*  This, according to police and prosecution documents obtained by NBC News. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=335.0s)]
*  And tonight, there's a new focus on the prosecutor who helped arrange that deal a decade ago. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=340.0s)]
*  Now the Secretary of Labor. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=346.0s)]
*  Okay, remember this? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=349.0s)]
*  The number one example of the elite lack of accountability for this guy Jeffrey Epstein is the fact that a US attorney hammered out this plea deal that was just unheard of, that just basically let him get away with it and then go back to reoffending. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=350.0s)]
*  The guy that gave him that deal, Donald Trump appointed him, Alex Acosta, in his cabinet, the guy who gave the Epstein deal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=368.0s)]
*  He got a cabinet position because he was appointed by Donald Trump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=375.0s)]
*  And it was a big scandal at the time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=378.0s)]
*  Acosta ultimately resigned in 2019 amid renewed interest in the Epstein case, although he defended the plea deal until the end. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=380.0s)]
*  A lengthy investigation from Trump's Department of Justice ultimately found that Acosta exhibited poor judgment, although it cleared him of any official misconduct. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=388.0s)]
*  Now, around the time that Epstein was negotiating that deal, the one that basically allowed him to more or less get away scot-free and go back to reoffending, he was represented by a number of high profile attorneys, including former counsel OJ Simpson Alan Dershowitz and former Bill Clinton investigator Ken Starr. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=397.0s)]
*  You may remember those two men for a different reason. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=415.0s)]
*  Back in 2020, Donald Trump brought both of them on to assist his legal defense during his first impeachment trial. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=418.0s)]
*  Get me the Epstein defense team. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=425.0s)]
*  We should note both men have defended their actions as Epstein's lawyers. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=428.0s)]
*  Dershowitz also declined to comment to NBC News about these new Epstein documents. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=432.0s)]
*  And not long before that impeachment trial that they defended him in, remember, Jeffrey Epstein famously died in federal custody in a federal detention center here in New York City. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=437.0s)]
*  That that was the incident sparked countless Epstein didn't kill himself means that went everywhere in the in the conspiratorial part of the Internet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=448.0s)]
*  It transformed the sex offender into the current status of kind of fulcrum of right wing conspiracy theories worldwide. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=456.0s)]
*  Now, investigators later said Epstein was not killed, that it was in fact a suicide and that it occurred amid quote significant mixed conduct at the federal prison, a federal prison under the purview of the Department of Justice, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=463.0s)]
*  which at the time was run by let me see if I have this right here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=477.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Trump's attorney general Bill Barr. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=480.0s)]
*  Bill Barr called Epstein's death a perfect storm of screw ups, sort of a passive way to describe a debacle that happened under your authority. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=484.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump's Justice Department was overseeing Jeffrey Epstein when he died in prison. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=494.0s)]
*  Of course, the real link here is the personal relationship between Donald Trump Epstein himself, the one you see on your screen right now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=500.0s)]
*  Trump has denied any connection to Epstein's crimes. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=507.0s)]
*  He declined to comment NBC News about these new documents, but it's undeniable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=510.0s)]
*  It's just an established fact. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=514.0s)]
*  The two men were once friendly back in 1992 before Epstein's first arrest. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=516.0s)]
*  The two men were captured on video partying at Trump's Mar-a-Lago golf home and crucially leering at women together. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=521.0s)]
*  One decade later, Trump went on the record with New York Magazine to praise Epstein in these words, and I will quote them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=528.0s)]
*  I've known Jeff for 15 years. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=535.0s)]
*  Terrific guy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=537.0s)]
*  He's a lot of fun to be with. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=539.0s)]
*  It is even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=541.0s)]
*  And many of them are on the younger side. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=545.0s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=549.0s)]
*  Jeffrey enjoys his social life. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=551.0s)]
*  That's a hell of a quote, isn't it? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=554.0s)]
*  About a guy who we would later find out was trafficking girls, sexual abuse. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=558.0s)]
*  And though Trump later claimed he and Epstein had a falling out, his well wishes didn't end there. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=565.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=570.0s)]
*  Just listen to how Donald Trump responded from the White House briefing room after being asked about Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=579.0s)]
*  I haven't really been following it too much. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=580.0s)]
*  I just wish her well, frankly. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=582.0s)]
*  I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=584.0s)]
*  But I wish her well. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=590.0s)]
*  I wish her. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=592.0s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=596.0s)]
*  They had just had the Alex Acosta scandal. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=597.0s)]
*  Everyone knows what happened with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=600.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, as president from the podium, says, oh, yeah, knew her socially. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=603.0s)]
*  Wish her well. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=607.0s)]
*  Rooting for her. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=608.0s)]
*  Hope she's doing fine. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=609.0s)]
*  Again, to be clear, at the time, Ghislaine Maxwell was in prison after being charged federally with conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=610.0s)]
*  But even when given the opportunity to walk those comments back, Trump refused. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=618.0s)]
*  Her friend or boyfriend Epstein was either killed or committed suicide in jail. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=622.0s)]
*  She's now in jail. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=629.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wish you well. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=630.0s)]
*  I'd wish you well. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=631.0s)]
*  I'd wish a lot of people well. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=632.0s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=633.0s)]
*  Let them prove somebody was guilty. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=634.0s)]
*  I mean, you do know that you're saying you hope she doesn't die in jail. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=636.0s)]
*  Is that what you mean by wish her well? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=639.0s)]
*  Her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happen? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=640.0s)]
*  Was it suicide? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=644.0s)]
*  Was he killed? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=645.0s)]
*  And I do wish you well. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=646.0s)]
*  Two things here that are important. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=648.0s)]
*  One is you can see the parts of the Internet and the media world that Trump gets his own information from. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=650.0s)]
*  I mean, remember, this guy's the president who directs the Department of Justice, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=655.0s)]
*  That report to him that had Epstein in custody, like maybe someone killed him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=660.0s)]
*  Maybe he died. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=664.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=665.0s)]
*  We should also note that they did prove somebody was guilty. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=667.0s)]
*  Gillain Maxwell was convicted by a jury on those charges as serving a 20-year sentence in prison. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=671.0s)]
*  But of course, the facts, you know, I mean, I'm banging my head against the wall here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=677.0s)]
*  I know full well the facts don't matter to the conspiracy crowd. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=683.0s)]
*  These are the type of folks who engage in what has become quite clearly a kind of watered down QAnon talking point. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=686.0s)]
*  Promote acts anti-vaccine nonsense. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=694.0s)]
*  Things are all false flags, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=697.0s)]
*  It's the kind of world and particularly the kind of voters, in short, who seem most drawn to support conspiracy theorist Robert F. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=699.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. for president. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=707.0s)]
*  You weren't ever on Jeffrey Epstein's jet, were you? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=710.0s)]
*  I was on Jeffrey Epstein's jet two times. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=715.0s)]
*  I was on it in 1993 and I was on it and I went to Florida with my wife and two children to visit my mom over Easter. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=718.0s)]
*  My wife had some kind of relationship with Gillain Maxwell and they offered us a ride to Palm Beach. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=734.0s)]
*  So I went then and on another occasion I flew again with my family with I think four of my children and and and marry my wife to Rapid City, South Dakota to go fossil hunting. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=743.0s)]
*  You were not after these get well, I mean, twice, you know, with my family wants to go fossil hunting. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=762.0s)]
*  But aside from that, now, Kennedy denies any wrongdoing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=766.0s)]
*  He's not been accused of any misconduct. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=769.0s)]
*  Be clear because, you know, lots of people, it seems again, this is part of what sort of makes the scandal so tantalizing for you. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=771.0s)]
*  Right. Lots of people flew on Epstein's private jet, including former President Bill Clinton. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=777.0s)]
*  That's also established and well known. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=782.0s)]
*  But again, to the conspiracist crowd that traffics almost exclusively in loose connections in Uendo, it should presumably be relevant that two of the three most prominent candidates for president of the United States of America have tangible connections to Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=784.0s)]
*  In fact, if you at home watching this or something of a single issue anti Epstein voter, there's only one major candidate for president without any meaningful ties to Epstein. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=800.0s)]
*  His name's Joe Biden. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=809.0s)]
*  Keep that in mind the next time Fox News tries to use Epstein to smear the left. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=811.0s)]
*  You've probably heard the phrase bend the knee long predates HBO's Game of Thrones, but it was often used on that show when a monarchial figure managed to impose their will on a subjugated populace. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=818.0s)]
*  Reinforcing that this new person was fully in charge. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=828.0s)]
*  I offer you a choice. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=833.0s)]
*  Bend the knee and join me. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=835.0s)]
*  Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it or refuse and die. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=837.0s)]
*  That brutal pre democratic vision of governance through force is, I think, one of the few sincere beliefs that's held by the ex president. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=858.0s)]
*  Donald Trump underscores it all the time when he congratulates Kim Jong Un or Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=877.0s)]
*  He has conducted himself in that fashion no more so than within the Republican Party, where he views himself as a king to whom everyone must pledge loyalty. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=883.0s)]
*  And amazingly, it has worked as documented in new reporting from the New York Times. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=891.0s)]
*  Quote, In October, Trump sunk a top candidate for speaker Tom Emmer by posting that voting for him would be a tragic mistake. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=896.0s)]
*  On Wednesday, Emmer capitulated and endorsed him. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=902.0s)]
*  They always bend the knee, Trump said privately of Emmer's endorsement. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=905.0s)]
*  Timmy Snyder is a professor of history at Yale University, an expert on the history of fascism, author of On Tyranny, 20 Lessons from the 20th Century, and he joins me now. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=909.0s)]
*  I guess one of the things that I've been thinking about with this story is there's some line of like normal, rough and tumble democratic politics, which is like cajoling people to get endorsements and maybe even kind of threatening them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=919.0s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, I'm going to come after you in the press if you don't. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=932.0s)]
*  And then there's the vision of loyalty in a sort of autocratic way. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=935.0s)]
*  And what makes him on the other side of that line in your mind? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=942.0s)]
*  I think because, first of all, it's all personal. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=947.0s)]
*  There's never any loyalty to the law or to institutions or to the Constitution or to the government or to the country. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=951.0s)]
*  It's all personal. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=958.0s)]
*  And that's where the line is. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=960.0s)]
*  Sure, a normal democratic politician will trade favors. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=962.0s)]
*  We'll want this for that. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=965.0s)]
*  But there's usually some sense of operating within the rules. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=967.0s)]
*  For Mr. Trump, there aren't rules. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=970.0s)]
*  There's just the idea of him as a person. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=973.0s)]
*  There's also the aspect, and I don't think this is the case in like Tom Emmer's case, that he was worried about physical violence or threats. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=976.0s)]
*  But it is the case, clearly. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=983.0s)]
*  And you see it in the discourse and you've commented on this a little bit even about how people react to the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ruling, that if you go along with this, there will be violence. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=985.0s)]
*  And we know firsthand from a number of different accounts, including McKay Coppin's biography of Mitt Romney and other former members of Congress, that people have made calculations about how they will politically relate to Donald Trump based purely on fear and fear of threats for them and their family. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=996.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1014.0s)]
*  Like, Mr. Trump, there's no dragon, right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1016.0s)]
*  I mean, he's not physically fearful. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1019.0s)]
*  You know, the only source of fear is what he's going to say about you on social media and then how other people might react to that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1021.0s)]
*  So there's a pretty profound cowardice inside his own threats. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1028.0s)]
*  He's not actually facing anybody directly. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1033.0s)]
*  But what you say about the Supreme Court is really important. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1036.0s)]
*  I mean, if we exist at all, we exist as a nation under law. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1039.0s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has the Constitution in which the very clear, very clear wording of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment makes it clear that an insurrectionist like Mr. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1043.0s)]
*  Trump or like a number of other people can't hold the presidency or for that matter any other state or federal office. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1052.0s)]
*  And yet we find a lot of people saying, well, you know, we're kind of afraid of what his supporters might do if we enforced the law of the land. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1058.0s)]
*  And if once you take that step, once you preemptively concede that you don't really believe in the law because you're afraid of a threat that hasn't even been made, then you're you know, then you're taking part in undoing the republic. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1066.0s)]
*  There was another story today that struck me about this sort of, you know, cult of personality or sort of this sort of, you know, king like view of loyalty, right? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1078.0s)]
*  Which to me is just fundamentally deeply anti-democratic in its ethos. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1088.0s)]
*  At least Stefanic withdrew her endorsement of a Republican candidate in Ohio who mildly criticized Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1092.0s)]
*  This is what the Craig Rydell said. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1100.0s)]
*  He said, I think he's arrogant. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1102.0s)]
*  I don't like the way he calls people names. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1103.0s)]
*  I just don't think that's very becoming of a president, he said in an audio recording. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1105.0s)]
*  Stefanic said this earlier this week. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1108.0s)]
*  I informed Craig Rydell that I will be withdrawing my endorsement. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1111.0s)]
*  I was very disappointed in his inappropriate comments regarding President Trump. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1114.0s)]
*  As we begin 2024, my focus is on ensuring we nominate the strongest candidates in the ballot who are committed to electing President Trump this November and expanding our House GOP majority. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1119.0s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1128.0s)]
*  I think it's striking that anyone would think that appropriate and inappropriate are the criteria that one would apply to to Donald Trump. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1130.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1139.0s)]
*  The way she's using the word inappropriate is we must simply follow along with whatever the man says and we must simply anticipate his every need and do what that is. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1140.0s)]
*  That's a standard of appropriateness and inappropriateness which has nothing to do with policy or with the law or what's good for the country. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1151.0s)]
*  It just has to do with the whims of someone who you regard as a leader. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1158.0s)]
*  For me, that's the distinction going back to your earlier question. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1162.0s)]
*  He's not meant to be a candidate or a president or an executive officer. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1165.0s)]
*  From this point of view, he's a leader with a capital L. He's just a person. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1169.0s)]
*  He's not somebody who holds an office. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1174.0s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, as always. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1176.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1178.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tEOGbnxxY&t=1195.0s)]
