# Hakeem Jeffries: Democrats will deliver the House votes to avoid default
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI)
*  I'm joined now by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=0.0s)]
*  And Congressman, first let me just ask you your sort of top line understanding of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=4.0s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, good evening, Chris. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=13.84s)]
*  I think President Biden accomplished three very important objectives. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=14.84s)]
*  First to make sure that we avoided a devastating and catastrophic default and stopped the extreme [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=18.76s)]
*  mega Republicans from crashing the economy, triggering a job killing recession, which [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=24.8s)]
*  would have hurt millions and millions of everyday Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  The second thing that was accomplished here is to make sure that the debt ceiling was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  suspended for two years, taking it into the early part of 2025 and removing their ability [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=38.4s)]
*  for the balance of this Congress to take the country down another hostage taking exercise. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=47.32s)]
*  Third, President Biden was able to protect some really important Democratic priorities, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=54.0s)]
*  protect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect Medicaid, protect veterans, protect [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=60.36s)]
*  the country from the types of extreme right wing cuts that the Republicans were demanding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=65.12s)]
*  in the bill that they passed in April, the Default on America Act, 22% cuts they were [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=71.12s)]
*  proposing across the board. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=76.28s)]
*  And so I think on balance in this circumstance, where he was dealing with an extreme, unreasonable [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=79.1s)]
*  group of people who were determined to bring about a bad result for the American people, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  that President Biden did an incredibly good job in a very difficult situation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about the sort of hostage shaking aspect of this, because there's a sort of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  critiques of the substance of the bill and then there's the critiques of essentially [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  incentivizing this again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=105.36s)]
*  So we saw in 2011, they did it again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=106.61999999999999s)]
*  It's now pushed through to 2025, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=108.78s)]
*  The next time they'll have to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=111.42s)]
*  Now, let's say you have a President Biden in a Republican Congress again. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=112.94s)]
*  Not a crazy idea, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=116.06s)]
*  It's like, okay, we're going to go through this every time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  Has it changed anyone's thinking among your House colleagues that you have to get rid [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=121.06s)]
*  of this thing once and for all, whether it's to do what Gephardt did when he was a Democratic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=125.18s)]
*  leader and essentially come together and just get rid of it statutorily, whether the White [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=129.02s)]
*  House has to look into saying, look, the Constitution doesn't allow us not to pay our debts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=132.78s)]
*  Where are you on that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=137.06s)]
*  Because that seems to me still the kind of unfinished business of this deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I think very good point, Chris. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=144.1s)]
*  It's an it's an all of the above approach. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  First thing that we have to do is get through this moment, make sure the country pays our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  bills, avoid a default, and we can continue to build an economy that works for everyday [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  Americans building upon the great record of accomplishment that came out of the last Congress. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=157.22s)]
*  But we also have to find our way out of enabling extreme right wing individuals in the Congress [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=162.74s)]
*  to use the debt ceiling down the road to take us down this hostage taking exercise and try [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  to extract a painful ransom. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=176.38s)]
*  And so we need to look at the options legislatively. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  I think that would be the best solution that's in front of us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=181.86s)]
*  And to see where the opportunities are moving forward. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=185.8s)]
*  McConnell had agreed on a proposal initially several years ago that would change the formula [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=188.82s)]
*  related to the debt ceiling and effectively give the administration through the secretary [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  of treasury the ability and presumption to be able to do this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=200.26s)]
*  Yes, without, you know, Congress being able to weigh in at the front end. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=204.66s)]
*  So I think we need to look at that because it's a proposal that the Senate Republicans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=208.9s)]
*  have at least supported in the past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=213.12s)]
*  And then the administration can explore some of the options that may be available to it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=215.26s)]
*  outside of the context of the crisis that we're in right now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=222.98s)]
*  I'd forgotten the McConnell proposal was basically it defaults to it being raised. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=223.98s)]
*  And if you want to stop it from being raised, then you have to act to pass legislation as [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=228.14s)]
*  opposed to the way that we have it now, which is, as you said, perfectly sets up this sort [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=232.62s)]
*  of this hostage negotiation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=236.54s)]
*  In terms of the process, how involved? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=239.14s)]
*  I mean, who who cut this deal and how involved were you? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=240.9s)]
*  Well, President Biden and his team had the laboring or, but they were in close communication [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=246.34s)]
*  with Leader Schumer and with myself and House Democrats every step of the way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=251.5s)]
*  And I greatly appreciate that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=256.74s)]
*  And House Democrats were unified. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=258.58s)]
*  We were unified in getting behind the discharge petition to make it clear that there was an [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=259.58s)]
*  option here if we couldn't find an acceptable resolution. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=265.9s)]
*  We were unified in all voting against the House Republican extreme default on America [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=269.7s)]
*  Act, making it clear that there was no room, no leverage in terms of trying to peel off [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=275.18s)]
*  Democrats that we all stood strongly behind President Biden and his team in avoiding default [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=282.02s)]
*  and arriving at a resolution that protected our values and that was acceptable to Democrats [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=288.4s)]
*  in the House and in the Senate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=294.28s)]
*  I want to play you what when the deal was coming together, Congressman Matt Gaetz, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=295.98s)]
*  I think late last week when the sort of contours were being public, sort of offered a prediction [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=299.58s)]
*  about what how he thought this would go. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=304.7s)]
*  And I thought it it looks like it's fairly astute. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=306.54s)]
*  And I'm curious to get your reaction. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=308.62s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=310.3s)]
*  I think that it will pass with about 80 to 100 Democrat votes and between 140 and 160 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=312.38s)]
*  Republican votes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=320.78s)]
*  I think the coalition opposed to this will be like the squad and the Freedom Caucus, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=321.82s)]
*  and it will it will rocket through the Senate after it passes the House. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=329.61999999999995s)]
*  And I think that there is no serious threat to McCarthy's speakership. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  Basically a pass on a bipartisan basis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=339.82s)]
*  I guess the question for you is, are you whipping votes for this? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  Is this is this a vote that you're going to go around and and really get Democrats to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  vote yes on? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, we're continuing the process of engaging with the administration and making sure that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=352.5s)]
*  they are presenting information, which they have been doing in a very clear and comprehensive [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=355.94s)]
*  way to members as it relates to the contours, the four corners of the resolution. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=361.5s)]
*  And we'll be hearing from them tomorrow in person at a caucus meeting. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=367.29999999999995s)]
*  But I do expect that Democrats will make sure that we don't default and that this agreement [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=371.17999999999995s)]
*  that is presented is able to pass out of the House through the Senate and gets to President [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=376.98s)]
*  Biden's desk. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=382.02s)]
*  But it's important for House Republicans to produce at least 150 votes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=383.42s)]
*  This is an agreement that they themselves negotiated and they should be able to produce [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=389.1s)]
*  the votes necessary, consistent with what Representative Gates said in order to help [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=395.26s)]
*  get this thing over the finish line. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=399.38s)]
*  That's interesting because that's those two parts of the answers are somewhat in tension [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=401.3s)]
*  with them. Right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=404.58s)]
*  You're saying like, look, we, you know, the leadership in the White House, the White House [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=405.06s)]
*  that we generally trust thinks it's a good deal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=408.34s)]
*  They're explaining why they think it's a good deal, why a membership vote. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  But then the second part is, Kevin, buddy, you negotiated this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=413.06s)]
*  This is what you're doing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=417.9s)]
*  We can't give you you got to do the heavy lifting on these votes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, he's got to do his part to avoid a default. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=424.14s)]
*  But I do think that for the reasons that I outline and the protection of those Democratic [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=426.94s)]
*  values, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, you know, vulnerable individuals, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=432.38s)]
*  the homeless, people who are aging out of foster care. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=436.65999999999997s)]
*  These are all communities and issues that we fight hard for as Democrats. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=440.26s)]
*  They're President Biden protected. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=444.26s)]
*  But at the same time, if we're going to have a bipartisan resolution to this, that means [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=445.62s)]
*  that in addition to House Democrats helping to avoid a default, that's exactly what House [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=451.26s)]
*  Republicans should do as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=456.58s)]
*  All right, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, I appreciate you taking some time with us tonight. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=458.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwnU7B5AlI&t=462.02s)]
