# Trump official doubts seniors would mind if their Social Security checks stopped
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw)
*  And then on top of all this are the comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=0.0s)]
*  he's worth probably more than a billion dollars, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=7.32s)]
*  who gave this answer to some other billionaires on a podcast to a question about people trying to intimidate Doge. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=10.4s)]
*  Is it basically to put fear into people that are trying to find this waste and fraud? Is that what that is? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=17.6s)]
*  The burning of the dealerships, the... [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=25.2s)]
*  If you're... I describe it to people this way. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=27.2s)]
*  Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=31.16s)]
*  My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=37.24s)]
*  She just wouldn't. She'd think something got messed up and she'll get it next month. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=47.2s)]
*  Anybody who's been in the payment system and the process system knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=54.32s)]
*  Because whoever screams is the one stealing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=62.56s)]
*  Congressman Suha Souramanyam is a Democrat representing Northern Virginia and he joins me now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=66.12s)]
*  Congressman, I want to talk about a really raucous town all you had this week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=72.56s)]
*  But first I want to ask if you think Mr. Lutnick, and God bless his mother-in-law, who I certainly hope gets her check, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=77.28s)]
*  do you think this is a good idea for detecting fraud to stop all Social Security payments and just see who complains because those people are cheating the system? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=85.64s)]
*  No, it's a terrible way. But let's be real. This is not about waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=94.64s)]
*  This is really about trying to cut Social Security altogether. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  I actually heard from many constituents today that their appointments were cancelled. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=103.84s)]
*  So first they're saying that, yes, you need to come in person now to do a lot of your stuff. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  And then they're cancelling the appointments. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=113.76s)]
*  I heard from another constituent who actually works at the Social Security office who said that half her office has been fired, so they can't even fulfill these appointments. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=115.68s)]
*  So they're trying to cut Social Security. Social Security is an earned benefit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's a promise that we made to our seniors that they paid into for decades. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=127.84s)]
*  And I just think it's terrible what he said and it's terrible what this administration is doing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=132.4s)]
*  It seems to me like there's a possibility that, you know, the congresswoman, your colleague from Wyoming, basically said the president has been very clear he's not going to cut Social Security. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=136.72s)]
*  And he has said things like this many times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=146.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk calls it a Ponzi scheme. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And it seems like one way to understand what's happening, I don't know if this is happening, but I want to get your feedback, is the way that they're getting out of this is we promise not to cut it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=150.32s)]
*  But we really want to cut it is to kind of back door cut it by making it really hard for people to get their checks. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=159.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. And they're doing this across the government. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=166.0s)]
*  They're saying that they're going around waste, fraud and abuse is the problem, that they're fixing it by firing all these lazy federal workers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  But the federal workers actually live in my district. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=176.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, they do incredibly important work to make us safe, make us healthy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=178.88s)]
*  And what's happening with Social Security is happening across the government with veterans being fired at the VA. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=184.4s)]
*  And I'll just tell you, like, this is this is really troubling because what's going to happen is they're going to they're coming after seniors now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=189.52s)]
*  They're coming after veterans. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=196.44s)]
*  Even if you're not in that class, they're coming after you next, because they are not they're touching the third rail of politics that has never been touched before. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should note that the acting Social Security commissioner, who is now the acting commissioner of Social Security and seems to be kind of a Doge partner, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  a guy by the name of Leland Dudek, he was ordered by a judge that Doge had to stop going through the data at Social Security. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=215.44s)]
*  The judge said that Doge was essentially engaged in a fishing expedition there in search of a fraud epidemic based on little more than suspicion that it never identified or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=222.72s)]
*  articulated even a single reason for which the Doge team needs unlimited access to the entire record systems. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=231.72s)]
*  We know they've been saying this nonsense about 200 year old people getting checks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=237.36s)]
*  And so in response to that, the acting administrator, again, this is Trump's person there, said today that he is consulting with agency lawyers in the Justice [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=242.12s)]
*  Department and threatening to shut down the agency in response to that court ruling blocking must team. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  Such a dramatic move would be unprecedented in the agency's history, would immediately begin halting payments for millions of Americans. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=258.8s)]
*  What would that mean to the people you represent? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=265.88s)]
*  I mean, for some people, they rely on Social Security. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  At a town hall last night, we had someone say that their son is on food stamps and Social Security is their lifeline and they paid into it their whole life. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=271.64s)]
*  Right. And so for some people, you know, it's going to leave them in a horrible situation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  But, I mean, you know, again, we just you have to look at this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  This is not about cutting waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=288.36s)]
*  I mean, really what they're doing is they're testing the American people right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=290.36s)]
*  They want to say you heard him. He said his grandma or his mother wouldn't say anything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=294.44s)]
*  But I know a lot of seniors who would. And people need to speak out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=298.72s)]
*  People need to fight back right now. We as a party, me as a legislator, we have to fight back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=302.36s)]
*  But also the American people need to speak out, too, because if we don't say anything, if we let this be the norm, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=307.68s)]
*  then we're heading in a really dark place in the wrong direction. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLCj_IO_jw&t=313.6s)]
