# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 20
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and I want to start with some news tonight that is not in the headlines. You probably won't see anywhere else. In fact, it may not even cross your radar screen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, most of the political dialogue has been focused on the national polls and a lot of hand wringing among Democrats over President Joe Biden's reelection chances. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=9.0s)]
*  We actually just had last night two elections. Last night, real people actually voted. They went to polling places and cast their ballots in two different states. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=17.0s)]
*  And I submit there is a strong case to be made that those results last night tell us way more about the state of our democracy and the political strength of the pro-democracy forces in this country than all of today's other political headlines put together. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=26.0s)]
*  So one of those races was in Western Pennsylvania to fill an open state house seat in District 21. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=40.0s)]
*  Now this special election was key because it would decide which party controls the narrowly divided Pennsylvania state house. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=49.0s)]
*  The Democratic candidate, 32-year-old Lindsay Powell, won as expected in the heavily Democratic district. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=55.0s)]
*  But here's the thing to pay attention to. Her margin of victory was even better than expected. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=62.0s)]
*  The district she's running in, the 21st district, is 17 percentage points more Democratic, more or less, than the country as a whole. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=67.0s)]
*  If last night's results hold, Lindsay Powell will have won by 30 points. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=75.0s)]
*  That is what we call an overperformance of 13 points, that D plus 13. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=80.0s)]
*  Also last night, there was another special election, this one in a very, very different kind of district. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=86.0s)]
*  This was in New Hampshire. And to me, this is an even more interesting and more representative story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=91.0s)]
*  In this district, House District 1, it's a Republican-leaning area. It's near the capital of Concord. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=96.0s)]
*  It narrowly went for Donald Trump in 2020. That's a Trump district. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=102.0s)]
*  It leans six points further to the right than the nationwide average. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=105.0s)]
*  But yesterday, Democrat Hal Rafter defeated an extreme MAGA Republican by 12 points, making for a whopping 18 point swing to the left. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=110.0s)]
*  Now, to be fair, let's be clear here. This is a tiny district. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=120.0s)]
*  The New Hampshire state house notoriously is enormous. It has 400 members, each representing about 3,300 people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=124.0s)]
*  This is a small sample. It's a little glimpse into the ginormous landscape of this country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=130.0s)]
*  But the really important thing to understand and the reason I am leading tonight's show with this news is that this is not an isolated incident. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=135.0s)]
*  In fact, it's part of what continues to be one of the most surprising and reliable political trends of the last few years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=143.0s)]
*  And this trend has done a much better job of telling us where the pulse of the nation really is than a lot of polling. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=151.0s)]
*  And certainly a lot of the political discourse. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=158.0s)]
*  Remember the context here as I speak to you in the fall of 2023. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=161.0s)]
*  Last year around this time, right, run up to the midterms, almost everyone in the political media believe the Democrats were going to be shellacked. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=166.0s)]
*  The conventional wisdom, again, not crazy, was that Joe Biden and his party were focusing on the wrong things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=174.0s)]
*  They were talking too much about abortion and about democracy, not enough on inflation and kitchen table issues. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=180.0s)]
*  And voters just had enough. Democrats were going to lose control of the House and the Senate. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=187.0s)]
*  And it was going to be a red wave. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=193.0s)]
*  Be an analyst for a second. Does it feel like a red wave? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=196.0s)]
*  It feels like a red wave, Brian. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=200.0s)]
*  You know, your predictions of a red wave are accurate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=202.0s)]
*  So I met a surfboard said the red wave is coming. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=205.0s)]
*  Red wave rising. That red wave that I'm convinced is coming. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=207.0s)]
*  The reports I'm seeing show a big red wave coming. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=211.0s)]
*  Sleepy Joe just guaranteed a red wave in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=215.0s)]
*  Democrats are bracing for the worst case scenario. A red tsunami. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=218.0s)]
*  We are officially on a red tsunami watch. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=221.0s)]
*  Of course, then election night came and the folks at Fox News and a lot of the political world was shocked. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=224.0s)]
*  Instead of a red tsunami, Joe Biden and Democrats pulled off the best midterm performance for an incumbent president in a quarter century. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=230.0s)]
*  If you're a Republican, things are really not looking very good for you right now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=240.0s)]
*  First of all, you underperformed all of these expectations of a red wave or some sort of big, big victory. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=244.0s)]
*  Just didn't happen. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=252.0s)]
*  This wasn't even a red wave. It's not even a red little ripple in a pond. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=254.0s)]
*  Everything lined up for Republicans yet you see them underperforming the way they did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=258.0s)]
*  The only red wave this season is going to be a German shepherd commander knocks over the cranberry sauce on our table. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=263.0s)]
*  Whoever wrote that joke. Nice one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=270.0s)]
*  Now, nobody saw it coming, but I submit that they could have. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=273.0s)]
*  At least in retrospect, it's clear there was some real indicators. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=277.0s)]
*  And one of the most important was looking at how Democrats were doing in special elections. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=280.0s)]
*  The trend emerged in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=287.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, Democrats were overperforming in special election after special election all over the country in Republican areas and in Democratic areas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=292.0s)]
*  It began last September last summer with Nebraska, Minnesota and New York. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=300.0s)]
*  And the story continued all through this year. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=304.0s)]
*  The folks at five thirty eight compiled this chart. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=308.0s)]
*  Thirty different special elections so far in twenty twenty three. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=310.0s)]
*  These are all different districts, legislative state districts all over the country. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=313.0s)]
*  Again, in areas with different profiles, demographically, different politics. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=318.0s)]
*  When you look through this list, you see Democrats overperforming their baseline over and over and over again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=323.0s)]
*  In fact, that is the case in twenty four out of these 30 races. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=331.0s)]
*  Now, in some instances where you see these big Democratic swings, the Republican candidate still won the election, but they won by a lot less than you would expect. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=335.0s)]
*  Look at one of the first special elections of the year. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=344.0s)]
*  It's in Virginia's 24th House District. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=346.0s)]
*  The Republican won resoundingly by 25 points. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=348.0s)]
*  But that was a 14 point underperformance to the party. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=352.0s)]
*  Or look at Pennsylvania's 35th House District. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=355.0s)]
*  Democrat won by 49 points overperforming for the district by 37. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=357.0s)]
*  Even in Kentucky, the Democrats swung Senate District 19, 29 points to the left. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=362.0s)]
*  And we've seen it in Georgia and in Wisconsin, in New York, in Louisiana, in Maine and Tennessee. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=368.0s)]
*  The combined average of all 30 of these races, again, a somewhat random sample of the country shows Democrats overperforming the baseline margin by 11 points. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=375.0s)]
*  This is a real phenomenon. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=386.0s)]
*  It's really there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=388.0s)]
*  It's not polling. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=389.0s)]
*  It's real. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=390.0s)]
*  It represents what you might even cheekily call the silent majority. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=392.0s)]
*  Folks showing up to register their preference in the only polls that really matter. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=397.0s)]
*  It's the silent majority that showed up in 2020, propelling Joe Biden to victory with a margin of more than seven million votes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=402.0s)]
*  It's the silent majority that also showed up in contested districts and contested statewide races across the country to reject extreme Trump-aligned candidates like Blake Masters and Curry Lake in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=408.0s)]
*  It's the same silent majority that showed up last night on a random Tuesday in September. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=423.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=430.0s)]
*  Like there's not usually an election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=431.0s)]
*  And they showed up in New Hampshire and they showed up in Pennsylvania to vote for center left pro-democracy candidates. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=433.0s)]
*  That says something robust and inspiring about where we stand at this moment nearing another presidential election year. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=441.0s)]
*  Of course, you know, I know we were made a very polarized country. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=451.0s)]
*  And the threat to democracy in the person of Donald Trump and the faction he represents and the forces that he's channeling is real and it is terrifying. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=455.0s)]
*  But if you feel that way, you are not alone. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=463.0s)]
*  When you stand in the pro-democracy coalition, remember, you are in the majority. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=467.0s)]
*  You are with those folks you've never met who don't write about politics for a living and who are out there showing up for special elections on a Tuesday night in September to vote in line with those values. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=473.0s)]
*  But there are a number of Trump lawyers and allies who have not been charged specifically in that Georgia case. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=484.0s)]
*  People like this guy. Remember him? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=491.0s)]
*  Former Trump lawyer, Lin Wood. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=493.0s)]
*  He first gained notoriety in the 90s, the lawyer for the security guard accused of the 1996 Olympic Park bombing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=496.0s)]
*  He later represented the parents of murdered six year old John Dane Ramsey. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=502.0s)]
*  Eventually, Lin Wood found his way to becoming a leading big lie conspiracy theorist. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=506.0s)]
*  And he was so incredibly zealous and vitriolic that in the run up to the Georgia runoff, he basically got on stage and told Georgians that things were so rigged, they just shouldn't vote at all. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=511.0s)]
*  Where's Kelly Lauper here? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=522.0s)]
*  Where's David Perdue? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=525.0s)]
*  He ought to be standing right here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=527.0s)]
*  Those two people want your vote? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=529.0s)]
*  Then they ought to tell you what we're telling Brian Kemp. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=532.0s)]
*  Get a special session of the legislature now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=536.0s)]
*  Do not be fooled twice. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=539.0s)]
*  This is Georgia. We ain't dumb. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=542.0s)]
*  We're not going to go vote on January 5th in another machine made by China. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=545.0s)]
*  You're not going to fool Georgians again. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=550.0s)]
*  If Kelly Lauper wants your vote, if David Perdue wants your vote, they've got to earn it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=554.0s)]
*  Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=561.0s)]
*  For God's sakes, fix it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=566.0s)]
*  You've got to fix it before we'll do it again. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=569.0s)]
*  Can you imagine being the staffer that goes up to David Perdue or Kelly Leffler and shows them that clip on the phone while they're trying to win this election? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=573.0s)]
*  It infuriated Republicans who would, of course, go on to lose both of those runoff races by narrow margins. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=582.0s)]
*  Well, today we learned in a new court filing the reason why Lin Wood was named in the Georgia indictment but not charged. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=588.0s)]
*  He is slated to be a witness for the state in District Attorney Fonny Willis's Rico case against Trump, Giuliani, and 17 others. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=594.0s)]
*  Joining me now are Anna Bauer, the Fulton County correspondent for the Legal Blot Law Fair, and Harry Lippman, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=602.0s)]
*  It's good to have you both. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=610.0s)]
*  Anna, let me start on the Lin Wood development. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=612.0s)]
*  This morning it seemed like, okay, well, maybe he's like full out cooperating. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=615.0s)]
*  He's cooperating and then this is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporting, and I just want to read what they're reporting. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=618.0s)]
*  They talked to him. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=624.0s)]
*  He said, I didn't flip on President Trump. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=625.0s)]
*  That's just pure nonsense. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=627.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have any knowledge to flip on him. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=628.0s)]
*  He said he would be told he will be subpoenaed by the prosecution, but he's not had any conversations with Willis about what questions he will be asked. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=630.0s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=637.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=640.0s)]
*  So I think that there could be a few things going on here. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=641.0s)]
*  One is that we know that Lin Wood testified before the special grand jury that investigated a 2020 election interference for more than seven months last year. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=644.0s)]
*  So he already has had this experience of testifying in Fulton County about these matters. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=654.0s)]
*  He has some knowledge of the election lawsuits, as you pointed out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=659.0s)]
*  He also has some knowledge of some of the early conversations that were going on when he hosted people like Sidney Powell at his plantation in South Carolina. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=663.0s)]
*  It was there, according to January 6 committee transcripts, that they first began discussing access to voting machines. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=673.0s)]
*  And that is precisely what Sidney Powell, of course, is indicted for in addition to the racketeering charges in Fulton County. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=682.0s)]
*  So he has some knowledge about a variety of things that he could testify to. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=691.0s)]
*  So it could be that he's just willing to respond to the subpoena and testify truthfully. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=697.0s)]
*  Another thing that could be going on here, Chris, is that the state wants to use him to get evidence into the case. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=704.0s)]
*  There's something called authentication that sometimes means that you have to put forward a witness who's able to say that documents or other materials are genuine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=712.0s)]
*  So it may be that they want him for some limited purpose like that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=723.0s)]
*  They want to put him on the stand so that he can say that some kind of documents or recordings or emails are in fact what the state says they are. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=726.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does seem clear that at first I thought, oh, maybe he sort of cut a deal because he was, you know, in the clip we showed, he's advocating, you know, this like facially authoritarian pooch, basically, where the, you know, the legislature just overrides the votes of the people of Georgia and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=734.0s)]
*  contravention of both Georgia state law, the Constitution, the state's electoral count act. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=749.0s)]
*  Harry, that doesn't look like it's the case, but it also reminds me that Fannie Willis' office as of now has to put, I mean, has to put a case together against the first two defendants, Sydney Powell and Kenneth Chesbrough in like a month. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=754.0s)]
*  Yeah, jury selection starts in what, five weeks? Yeah, I can't see it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=772.0s)]
*  So she now, the reason he's named is because she makes a motion saying there's different lawyers who have represented different witnesses. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=777.0s)]
*  He's called a witness for the state here. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=785.0s)]
*  But look, he testified because he was called to testify before the special grand jury that recommended indicting him. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=787.0s)]
*  I don't see any reason that the state would call him now in the cross-examination. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=794.0s)]
*  This is a guy who most recently didn't even defend his license rather because it was such an overwhelming case. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=799.0s)]
*  He just agreed to let it go. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=805.0s)]
*  He's a terrible witness, but I think they're being comprehensive. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=807.0s)]
*  It's easier to take somebody off a witness list than to add it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=811.0s)]
*  And remember, they came out in front of McAfee and gave that number of all their witnesses. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=816.0s)]
*  I just think it automatically includes the people who were in the special grand jury and that sort of as a kind of abundance of caution and connected specifically to this motion. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=820.0s)]
*  You should talk to the various parties about whether they're comfortable with their lawyers who represented other people at different times. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=830.0s)]
*  Right. And one of the things that's being identified here, right, the possible sort of antagonistic interests between co-defendants, right, that has to be sorted out and sort of looming all over all this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=838.0s)]
*  And we've seen this pop up in some of the things Jack Smith has said is this the question of like whose people who who are the lawyers representing the various defendants and who's paying for them and whose interests, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=847.0s)]
*  Are they defending? And one of the things that seems really clear, I just talked about Cassidy Hutchinson, who famously went from a Trump paid lawyer to another lawyer and came out and sort of gave the full truth in her in her telling. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=858.0s)]
*  That's how she says it happened. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=869.0s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani right now is being sued by his former lawyers claiming he owes them a one point four million in unpaid legal fees. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=871.0s)]
*  We know that he's been begging Trump to pay for his legal fees that Trump sort of reluctantly did a fundraiser. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=878.0s)]
*  But and I can imagine like this question right now, who is going to pay for all the lawyers and are you going to keep people in the tent is an enormous question of enormous consequence. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=884.0s)]
*  Right. It is a question of enormous consequence, and it's it's a it's a question of enormous consequence, especially for those defendants here who do not have some of the resources that people who are have deeper pockets do. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=896.0s)]
*  You know, the Puerto Rico trials are last very long in Georgia. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=912.0s)]
*  They cost a lot of money, and so there's a lot of incentives often for people to plea out early on because they do realize that, you know, it's something that they might not be able to afford defending the case. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=915.0s)]
*  And there are some of the defendants here who are charged alongside Trump, who are, you know, former teachers. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=928.0s)]
*  They've they've sought to raise some funds, you know, there or they're relying on the Georgia Republican Party for for their funding. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=934.0s)]
*  But if if some of those funding streams dry up, you really have to wonder if they see an incentive to make a deal. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=942.0s)]
*  Yeah, you also I mean, Jenna Ellis, for instance, who's publicly complained, she's also one of those people. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=948.0s)]
*  She's publicly complained, Harry, about the fact that her legal she can't pay her legal bills. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=953.0s)]
*  She's now said she won't vote for Trump. She called him a narcissist, I believe, which is like, OK, well, yeah, welcome to the party. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=958.0s)]
*  But but again, this does seem to create intense incentive for cooperation. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=964.0s)]
*  Completely keep your friends close and your enemies closer. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=969.0s)]
*  Look, Jen Ellis is the perfect example here. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=973.0s)]
*  She's got a GoFundMe site that I think if it continues at its robust pace, might fund two days of trial. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=976.0s)]
*  You know, what are they really supposed to do other than get public defenders, which a witness in Mar-a-Lago, by the way, did before telling the truth. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=982.0s)]
*  So even apart from the conflict problem, there's literally are they going to be bankrupt? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=990.0s)]
*  And then what? Look to Trump at the very end. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=994.0s)]
*  These are dangerous people in dangerous times for Trump. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=997.0s)]
*  . [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO27sB5STvE&t=1012.0s)]
