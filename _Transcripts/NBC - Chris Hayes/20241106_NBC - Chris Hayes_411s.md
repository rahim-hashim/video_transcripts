# ‘Pry them from our hands’: Chris Hayes shares post-election message
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A)
*  Welcome back to our second hour of our special election coverage. Everyone today, I think, is making sense to the extent it's possible. What happened last night? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=0.0s)]
*  Fair to say that most of the people watching right now, all of the people I think up here on this panel, I think it was a very bad outcome for the country. I certainly do. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=9.0s)]
*  But there's a question of why it happened and what comes next. And I do actually think it's really important to be as clear-eyed as possible about why it happened and what happened. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=18.0s)]
*  Donald Trump won a majority of votes in Electoral College, and for the first time in his three presidential runs, he appears poised to win the national popular vote. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=26.0s)]
*  But if you look at why he won, I also think it's clear it was primarily the driver, a rejection of the status quo in a period where many voters feel alienated from their leaders and squeezed by high prices. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=34.0s)]
*  The right track, wrong track numbers were two to one, people saying the country's on the wrong track. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=48.0s)]
*  And here's the thing that's really important. They feel that way across the Western world, where incumbent parties left, right, and center have met the exact same electoral fate post-COVID in an era of exploding inflation that no one had experienced in 30 years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=53.0s)]
*  This was an election defined by a rejection of a status quo that big majorities did not like, even people that voted for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=67.0s)]
*  Now, the thing about this is Trump and Republicans have an interest, vested interest, in interpreting this as a mandate for all of their worst governing impulses. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=77.0s)]
*  All the Stephen Miller-style Project 2025 dark fantasies of smashing the administrative state. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=87.0s)]
*  But those ideas were never popular. Remember, we've been through this. They were polling at 6%. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=93.0s)]
*  Trump tried to distance himself every chance he had from them because they polled so terribly. When you wrote down what they wanted to do, people didn't like it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=98.0s)]
*  That was not the source of this victory. You can see it all over America in last night's results. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=108.0s)]
*  You can see what happened down ballot in North Carolina. Voters picked Trump by a slight margin at the same time they elected Democrats as governor and lieutenant governor, attorney general, school superintendent. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=114.0s)]
*  They may have flipped enough legislative seats to take away the Republican supermajority and veto power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=123.0s)]
*  And you can see it in referenda around the country and in seven states, including the Trump states of Arizona, Missouri, and Montana, voters approved measures enshrining abortion rights. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=128.0s)]
*  Voters in deep red Missouri and Alaska also approved raises in the minimum wage. They joined Nebraska in mandating paid sick leave to workers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=137.0s)]
*  Just to add to all that, New Jersey elected its first Asian American senator. Maryland elected its first black and female U.S. senator. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=145.0s)]
*  So did Delaware, meaning the U.S. will have two black female senators for the very first time in its history. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=153.0s)]
*  Delaware has given Congress its first openly trans member. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=159.0s)]
*  What I want to say is that this is an addition that because of last night has suddenly signed on wholesale to the far right agenda of MAGA and Trump and the Republican Party. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=163.0s)]
*  But we know they're going to interpret this election as a mandate for precisely that, for full MAGAism. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=171.0s)]
*  And we also know they have a plan. It really is a destructive plan to the American Constitution, to American democracy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=177.0s)]
*  Most importantly to so many of our fellow Americans, mixed status families, trans folks, women, working class voters who are going to take it on the chin from tariffs and gutting labor law. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=184.0s)]
*  And we also know Donald Trump is an aspiring authoritarian. I mean the guy does not have a democratic bone in his body. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=194.0s)]
*  He tried to overthrow the Constitutional order with violence. We all saw it happen on national television. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=201.0s)]
*  He celebrated, talked about using political violence repeatedly in his campaigns. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=207.0s)]
*  And because of all that, we know they're going to try to do things to subvert and alter the Constitutional order. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=211.0s)]
*  But the most important thing to those of us who are committed to stopping them is to remember their success is not foreordained in any way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=217.0s)]
*  They're going to try and there are going to be a lot of people try to stop them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=225.0s)]
*  And the outcome of that is as yet undetermined. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=228.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying this from some place of airy hope. We've been covering Trump since 2015. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=232.0s)]
*  We covered his first term. He tried to do lots of bad things and failed to do them because he is completely distractible and inconstant because he's a vortex of chaos, because he cannot be stopped from doing stupid self-destructive things all the time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=237.0s)]
*  None of that changed because he won an election. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=251.0s)]
*  They're all the same people. He's the same guy. Are Republicans better prepared this time? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=254.0s)]
*  Are they more loyal and suggesting more in their favor? Yes, yes, and yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=259.0s)]
*  But does that mean the outcome is foreordained? No. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=263.0s)]
*  The reason I say that is that public opinion, mass opinion, it's not a fixed thing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=267.0s)]
*  It's a real force and it changes and it flows and reacts to events. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=272.0s)]
*  And even Donald Trump has backed down when he found himself on the wrong side of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=276.0s)]
*  He has tried to move away from his most extreme anti-abortion position. He's tried to distance himself. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=280.0s)]
*  He understands it's unpopular because there was mobilization against it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=284.0s)]
*  One of the most monstrous things he did in his first term, as documented in my colleague, Jacob Soboroff's incredible documentary and book, Separated, was to essentially kidnap migrant children from their families. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=290.0s)]
*  And as the press reported this and as the courts reviewed it, it became clear this was both cruel and illegal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=301.0s)]
*  And while it was a federal judge that first blocked it, freezing it, the thing that ended child separation was a full rejection by the Democratic polity. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=307.0s)]
*  Thanks to organizing and mobilization and protest, Americans across the spectrum rightly came to see it as monstrous, rejected it loudly, and then rejected it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=318.0s)]
*  In the end, Trump signed the executive order ending the practice and then, classic, tried to take credit for getting rid of the heinous policy he had implemented. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=328.0s)]
*  But in the end, they had to abandon it because it was so unpopular. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=339.0s)]
*  That's just one example. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=344.0s)]
*  There will likely be things he doesn't abandon, but in the face of that, it really is important not to concede in advance that the United States is not going to abandon it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=347.0s)]
*  And I think that there is a need to concede in advance that politics don't matter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=356.0s)]
*  They do. Public opinion still matters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=362.0s)]
*  Politics didn't go away in America because three out of 100 people switched their presidential vote, which is to be clear what happened last night between 2020 and 2024. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=365.0s)]
*  And politics depends on the work of organizing and mobilizing and persuading our fellow Americans. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=377.0s)]
*  None of those tools have gone anywhere. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=383.0s)]
*  Some are even more important this time around. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=384.0s)]
*  We have to pick them up and we can't let anyone pry them from our hands. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4dlZrRwa0A&t=386.0s)]
