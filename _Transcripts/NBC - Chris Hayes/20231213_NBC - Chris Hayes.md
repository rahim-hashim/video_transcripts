# ‘Bizarre whining’ Trump lawyers call Jack Smith the Grinch in new court filing
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g)
*  There is news tonight from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=0.0s)]
*  The D.C. court has agreed to rule as soon as it can on Donald Trump's claim that his [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=5.96s)]
*  president is immune from criminal prosecution for the crimes he is accused of committing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  while in office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=15.68s)]
*  That two-page ruling signed by a George H.W. Bush-nominated judge and two Biden nominees [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=17.28s)]
*  grants a request from special counsel Jack Smith for an expedited hearing on Trump's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=22.48s)]
*  immunity claim. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=27.68s)]
*  Normally that would be good news for a defendant. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=29.12s)]
*  Hey, your appeal is going to be heard quickly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=31.16s)]
*  For Trump, whose lawyers were pushing for a longer, slower appeals process in hope it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=33.72s)]
*  might postpone his January 6 trial until after the election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=39.04s)]
*  Earlier this week, Smith called Trump's bluff. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=42.6s)]
*  He's also pursuing a parallel ruling on Trump's appeal not just in the D.C. appeals court, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=45.24s)]
*  which is normally where you go after this kind of thing, but all the way up to the Supreme [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=50.28s)]
*  Court. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  And now Trump has to submit his arguments to both courts next week. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=54.52s)]
*  Kimi Daya Ogongo-Williams, a former federal prosecutor who was senior investigative counsel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=58.56s)]
*  to the January 6 committee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  Donya Perry served as deputy New York state attorney general and as well as assistant U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=64.44s)]
*  attorney to Southern District New York, and they join me now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, I don't want to get too in the procedural weeds here because this is a very [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=70.84s)]
*  weird case, but basically Trump says at the district level, I was president, I'm immune. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=73.76s)]
*  Judge Shetkin says, I don't buy it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=79.72s)]
*  She issues a ruling I found very persuasive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  So the next step up is D.C. court of appeals, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  So that's happening. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=86.4s)]
*  Jack Smith is also going to the Supreme Court and saying, hey, this is going to get to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=87.64s)]
*  you eventually. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=90.28s)]
*  Can we just get along with it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=91.28s)]
*  So those are both sort of happening right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=92.28s)]
*  But the D.C. court of appeals responding today and saying like, yeah, we can move this along. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=94.32s)]
*  Tim Idaya, what do you make of that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=99.56s)]
*  I think they are taking this extremely seriously. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=101.32s)]
*  And I think it's important. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=103.48s)]
*  You know, Judge Shetkin today stayed all the deadlines in the trial, which means the discovery [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=104.84s)]
*  deadlines, the pretrial motions, all the work that has to happen to prepare for the March [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=110.72s)]
*  4 trial. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=114.96s)]
*  That's all on pause because of this appeal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=116.32s)]
*  But what great news for Jack Smith today is that because the appeals court is expediting, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=118.6s)]
*  Jack Smith is now on two tracks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=123.88s)]
*  He can win on the appeals court, but he's also prepping the Supreme Court to get that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=125.72s)]
*  potential victory there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=129.88s)]
*  Makes it more likely we have a trial next year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=131.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=133.12s)]
*  So that I mean, that was the one too today, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=134.12s)]
*  Judge Shetkin says, look, I have to she's not vacating them, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=135.12s)]
*  She's not saying these are gone. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=138.76s)]
*  The trials not happening. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=140.76s)]
*  She's just saying it's all pause. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=141.76s)]
*  We've got to see how this turns out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=142.76s)]
*  Now the balls of the court of these appeals courts, Donya. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=144.28s)]
*  And the big question here is like how fast are you going to move? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=146.24s)]
*  It does seem like the D.C. appellate court is signaling like we can go here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=148.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=152.6s)]
*  As is the Supreme Court. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  They very quickly agreed to expedite this process to determine whether or not they will [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=155.36s)]
*  allow this leapfrogging to happen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=162.0s)]
*  So all of this is happening essentially next week with the next week or so. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=164.56s)]
*  So we'll see if they if they grant it, it will just skip over this process, go even [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=168.6s)]
*  more quickly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=172.46s)]
*  There's a funny thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=173.5s)]
*  I remember once it was it was in a Supreme Court argument, I believe, over a trap law. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=174.5s)]
*  It might have been Women's Whole Health where, you know, before Roe v. Wade was overturned, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=178.78s)]
*  right, anti-abortion advocates would try to like create a bunch of like onerous regulations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=184.5s)]
*  on abortion clinics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=188.86s)]
*  It'd be like the hallways have to be eight feet wide. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=189.86s)]
*  And I remember this moment in Justice Kagan being like, do we have to pretend that you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=192.22s)]
*  guys actually care about this here? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=196.28s)]
*  Like we know what you're there to do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  And I remember it's like so I loved it so much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=199.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think there's a certain degree of law where like you're sort of presuming good faith. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  But this just seems like so obvious, the bad faith here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, here's here's Trump's lawyers complaining about their Christmas vacations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=209.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  They this is their reply brief. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  They say this proposed schedule will require attorneys and support staff to work around [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=216.82s)]
*  the clock through the holidays, inevitably disrupting family and travel plans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=221.1s)]
*  It is as if the special counsel growled with his grinch fingers nervously drumming. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=224.33999999999997s)]
*  I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=228.42s)]
*  But how and citation to Dr. Seuss? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=231.02s)]
*  Like what are we doing here? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=233.22s)]
*  I mean, I got to say, it's almost a bit offensive. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  I think Jack Smith in every filing he's put forward has reminded the American people what [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  is at stake, that we're dealing with a former president who directed violence, who uses [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  political process to undermine the transfer of power. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=249.74s)]
*  And when you have former President Trump's lawyers here citing children nursery rhymes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=252.72s)]
*  I think it really undermines the significance of what we're doing here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=258.46s)]
*  I'm also like, bro, I don't give a damn about your family vacation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=262.18s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  Like more at stake. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  There's stuff happening here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  Like it just seems like bizarre special pleading and whining. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  But again, the goal here is to delay. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=275.94s)]
*  Well, you're to your point earlier. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  Typically, if a defendant gets a bad ruling, they would like to move this forward faster, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=280.58s)]
*  more slowly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=287.34s)]
*  And so here it does kind of really betray the true colors here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=288.38s)]
*  They say again, and this is the Trump's lawyer brief, they say it's a blatant attempt to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=294.34s)]
*  interfere the 2024 presidential election to disenfranchise the tens of millions of voters [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  who support President Trump's candidacy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=304.7s)]
*  It does seem to me that that explicit argument is going to be made increasingly up this appeal [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=306.9s)]
*  chain. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=312.82s)]
*  And I wonder if you think even justices coming from an ideological background more adjacent [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=314.06s)]
*  to Donald Trump or appointed by him are going to are going to cotton to that argument. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=321.46s)]
*  Well, I think Jack Smith's response is a good one, which he's also focused on the American [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=325.46s)]
*  people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=330.26s)]
*  What he's saying is that the American people have a right to this answer to know exactly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=331.26s)]
*  So I think it actually is empowering the American people the way Jack Smith is framed is that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=335.52s)]
*  they should know whether the former president in fact engage in his conduct. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=338.85999999999996s)]
*  Frankly, if you were a defendant, what you want, that's typically right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=342.84s)]
*  You want to be absolved more quickly should be cleared before he appears stands for the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=346.84s)]
*  trial. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=354.11999999999995s)]
*  And if he truly is as innocent as he claims and he's going to he would want to have his [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=355.12s)]
*  deigned court. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  He won't want to remove the shadow from his candidacy and go into November without it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  So what are the things you're looking for again, because it's all this weird timing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=364.76s)]
*  game, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=368.12s)]
*  The actual outcome matters, although I think that the argument for immunity is so thin [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=369.36s)]
*  that I don't maybe you guys disagree with me, but I don't think anyone's on the same [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=373.76s)]
*  page. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=377.56s)]
*  Yeah, like it's just it's a ludicrous argument, honestly, that that what are you looking for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=378.56s)]
*  next week as these sort of these deadlines start to come in? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=383.36s)]
*  Like what we're going to see happen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=386.96s)]
*  I mean, it's going to play. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=388.6s)]
*  I mean, we'll see. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=390.16s)]
*  There's a little bit of play, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=391.76s)]
*  There's the the Supreme Court is getting briefs on the 20th. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=393.9s)]
*  Right. And then we have the 23rd for the for the Court of Appeals. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=399.16s)]
*  So it's you know, it's possible this Supreme Court could rule more quickly and then bypass [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=402.52s)]
*  the Court of Appeals. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=408.32s)]
*  We know what the arguments are. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=409.72s)]
*  Jack Smith said in his papers for the expedited appeal, we already know what the arguments [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  and maybe, you know, too bad, so sad if it bumps into your holiday plans. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=416.64s)]
*  But this is largely briefed already. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=421.44s)]
*  Yes, not going to be any new arguments. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=423.56s)]
*  And so we I don't think there's going to be any real surprises. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=425.76s)]
*  And we'll see, you know, there's plenty of precedent, although it is a unique context, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=429.68s)]
*  right? Can a former president be prosecuted criminally? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=434.84s)]
*  There's a lot of precedent in in favor of, you know, affirming that ruling. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=438.2s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, my colleague here at MSNBC, who covers legal affairs for us, made the point. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=443.84s)]
*  She was she said, you know, the Supreme Court, to give one example, can move quickly when [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=448.64s)]
*  it wants to. And she talked about Bush v Gore, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=454.64s)]
*  I mean, Bush v Gore was like, all of a sudden, they just like swooped in. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  They're like, stop, stop counting. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=459.28s)]
*  We're going to like look at this in expedited review, which is to say, like, this is all [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  volitional at some level. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=464.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=465.52s)]
*  I mean, the Supreme Court is fully in control here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think they are them and their law clerks are going to be fully considering the wide [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=469.2s)]
*  range of possibilities here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=474.08s)]
*  They're going to be considering the political implications. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=475.56s)]
*  I mean, they may not put that on paper, but I guarantee you they're thinking what happens [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=477.08s)]
*  next. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  Whatever decision they make here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, I mean, I want to ask you one more question, but save it for next time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. It's a little bit of a procedural one, but it's thinking about it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=488.64s)]
*  Timmy Dyle, Ganga Williams, Tonya Perry. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OeNAwdu55g&t=494.52s)]
