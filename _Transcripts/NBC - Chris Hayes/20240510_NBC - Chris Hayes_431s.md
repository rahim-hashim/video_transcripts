# 'Quid pro quo:' Trump vowed to gut climate laws in exchange for $1B from oil bosses
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q)
*  Last month, Donald Trump summoned a who's who of top lobbyists and executives from the oil and gas industry to the upscale [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  La Quinta slash bribery palace [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=6.46s)]
*  He calls Mar-a-Lago and proceeded to solicit a billion dollars from the fossil fuel companies to get him elected as [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=8.74s)]
*  Multiple outlets have now reported in exchange the Washington Post reports quote [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=15.44s)]
*  He vowed to immediately reverse dozens of President Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=19.62s)]
*  New York Times says quote Trump told the group that they should donate a billion dollars to his presidential campaign [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  Because if elected he would roll back environmental rules that he said hamper their industry [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=32.36s)]
*  He told executives the amount of money they would save in taxes and legal expenses after repealed regulations [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=37.6s)]
*  Would more than cover a billion dollar contribution [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=43.12s)]
*  And to be clear this is not [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=46.16s)]
*  Prosecutable under current law particularly in the way that Supreme Court has come to define bribery as a crime which is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Extremely attenuated these days [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=54.02s)]
*  But in common parlance it is a political quid pro quo [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=56.06s)]
*  One that is so shocking that while we don't know the sources of these articles it sure looks like Trump's offer managed to stun [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=60.46s)]
*  Even a bunch of oil executives who are used to the most craven parts of big money in politics as anyone in the entire country [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=66.38s)]
*  Lisa Friedman is an author of that article for the New York Times where she covers climate policy and politics and she joins me now [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=73.82s)]
*  It's great to have you we just described to me the setting the conditions under which this event happened what the folks who were [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=80.7s)]
*  invited were told [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=87.22s)]
*  Sure, thanks so much for having me. So [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=88.94s)]
*  last month around April 11th a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=92.22s)]
*  number of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  executives and lobbyists for oil and gas companies [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=97.9s)]
*  Arrived at Mar-a-Lago for what was described as an energy roundtable [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  They dined on chopped steak we were told by by people in the room and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=106.78s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump promised to unravel president Biden's climate change agenda [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=113.54s)]
*  top on the list we were told were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=119.7s)]
*  led regulations that were put in place recently [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  encouraging in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=126.5s)]
*  electric vehicle deployment [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=128.02s)]
*  wind energy was a target and of course a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=130.58s)]
*  Temporary ban that the Biden administration imposed on permitting new liquefied natural gas terminals [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=133.74s)]
*  the president the former president then told the crowd that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=141.22s)]
*  we were told that they should want to raise a billion dollars for him because [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=145.62s)]
*  this was going to help their industries and the money that they would save in in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=150.5s)]
*  taxes and legal fees [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=155.62s)]
*  fighting regulations would would [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=158.1s)]
*  Would be dwarfed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=161.18s)]
*  So there's there's sort of two pieces of context here one is that citizens united before citizens united this this wouldn't even really be a plausible [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=162.82s)]
*  Ask right. I mean if you're trying to raise a billion dollars in hard money, you know campaign limited [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=170.02s)]
*  $2,600 bytes is not gonna happen. It is in the environment [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=176.1s)]
*  We live in now where the ask if audacious is plausible in the sense that you know, the American Petroleum Institute [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=179.62s)]
*  Could get a billion dollars [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=187.54s)]
*  Channelled into something that some super PAC, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=189.7s)]
*  Certainly, I you know, I would note that the way the way it was relayed to us [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=194.06s)]
*  was less of a you do this for me, I'll do this for you and more of a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=198.22s)]
*  you in the room should want to raise a billion dollars for this campaign because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=204.34s)]
*  Trump to will be ready on day one to unravel the regulations and policies that are hurting your businesses [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=209.42s)]
*  Now one of the the other interesting bits of context here is that obviously the people in that room [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  I think are opposed to the Biden climate agenda [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=221.94s)]
*  On green energy and also opposed to those regulatory stances you took new no new permitting on exporting liquid [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=225.54s)]
*  Ni-Fi natural gas a pause on permits the Gulf and extra co taking Alaska offline, etc, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=232.22s)]
*  But if I'm not mistaken [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=238.54s)]
*  We're pumping more oil and gas than any country in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=241.06s)]
*  History ever and they're making record profits, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=245.58s)]
*  It's incongruous, isn't it? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=250.38s)]
*  You know, you're absolutely right. The Biden administration is overseeing record oil and gas production [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=253.54s)]
*  He is getting no credit for that from the oil and gas industry [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=259.7s)]
*  and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=265.46s)]
*  He also and you know in the administration also has been pretty quiet about that fact [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=268.02s)]
*  You have to mention also they're not eager to to tout that they you know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  They're they're very worried that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=278.86s)]
*  environmental groups, especially young people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  remain concerned about a number of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=284.18s)]
*  Green lights that the administration offered, you know last year particularly on willow a major oil development in Alaska [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=289.22s)]
*  There's a lot of lingering anger over that especially with young people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  And so we're finding the administration is not you know, isn't isn't out there [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=300.42s)]
*  Telling people right that they're doing a lot of development totally but the people who do know it [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=306.38s)]
*  I would suspect are the people in that room [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=312.62s)]
*  And they give you no credit. They probably know that they're pumping more oil and gas and doing pretty well, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=315.74s)]
*  I mean, I think they know that but they're still very angry at him is my sense from people [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  I've talked to inside the the energy world in the US [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=326.94s)]
*  You know, I've talked to executives with some major oil and gas companies who are very much in favor of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=331.46s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act the the landmark climate law that has pumped [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  370 some odd billion dollars into [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  renewable energy also carbon capture and storage something [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  You know something the fossil fuel industry is is eager for also direct air capture also hydrogen. Yes at the same time [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=351.48s)]
*  when [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=360.36s)]
*  President Biden made the decision to pause LNG exports [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=361.56s)]
*  It really touched off a nerve within the oil and gas community that was already [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=366.08s)]
*  angry and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=372.36s)]
*  Frustrated over decisions like curtailing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and other places [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=373.84s)]
*  This has really struck a nerve and there has been a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=379.96s)]
*  You know certainly no credit given to the administration for the record output of oil and gas that we're seeing right now [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=383.6s)]
*  The the argument from the oil industry is that that is because of policies that preceded the Trump administration [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=390.08s)]
*  Yes, they're gentle. They're gentle souls and and they get they get they get very upset when things don't go their way [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=397.0s)]
*  and so maybe they'll come up with a billion dollars for the guy who's promising the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=403.8s)]
*  Agenda their dreams Lisa Friedman. Thank you very much [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImlxYSxq1Q&t=408.06s)]
