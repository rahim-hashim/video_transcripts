# ‘Rule of law is for suckers’: How Donald Trump turned the GOP into the ‘Pro-Crime Party’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the most seismic stories of the past few years is the rise and fall of what you might call the Trump crime wave. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=2.0s)]
*  The wave began in 2020 when, remember, Donald Trump was president, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=8.0s)]
*  amidst the backdrop of the social dislocation and chaos of the pandemic and, of course, the George Floyd protests and the police response to them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=13.0s)]
*  And, of course, then President Trump also threw fuel on the fire at every opportunity. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=22.0s)]
*  We saw an enormous spike in crime across red and blue states, in small towns and big cities. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=28.0s)]
*  The murder rate jumped by a record 30 percent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=34.0s)]
*  As you can see in this graph, violent crime overall was up more than 5 percent in 2020. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=38.0s)]
*  Over the past three years, with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office, we have seen a huge nationwide decline in crime. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=42.0s)]
*  Latest data even suggests the violent crime rate may have dropped another 15 percent in just the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=50.0s)]
*  So the trends in crime are down, even with some holes in the data from various cities. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=61.0s)]
*  But the overall picture is clear. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=66.0s)]
*  Now, of course, the Trump crime wave is about much more than just the macro statistics. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=68.0s)]
*  Those are the most important for people to live to experience. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=72.0s)]
*  It is, of course, also about the fact that the man himself is a criminal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=76.0s)]
*  Just convicted of 34 felony counts here in New York, a man who surrounds himself with criminals, bringing them on stage at a recent rally and even into the courtroom with him during trial. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=80.0s)]
*  Donald Trump believes that following the rule of law, and this is crucial, is for suckers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=89.0s)]
*  He has imbued the Republican Party with his mafia ethos. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=95.0s)]
*  Snitches get stitches. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=99.0s)]
*  The top dog should get away with everything. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=100.0s)]
*  And for all the talk among Trump and his allies about backing the blue, it is clear that when law enforcement is not under his control, as it would be in a sort of authoritarian enterprise, then it becomes the subject to suspicion and even insults. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=102.0s)]
*  Just look at what happened at the Pennsylvania State House earlier this month. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=116.0s)]
*  Democrats there welcomed two Capitol police officers who were injured by the violent pro-Trump mob that was out for blood on January 6th. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=121.0s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump praises the insurrectionists who beat the cops bloody as warriors and hostages who he promises to free from prison if he is reelected. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=129.0s)]
*  So when these two officers were introduced on the State House floor, listen to how Republicans reacted before they were drowned out by the Democrats. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=140.0s)]
*  This morning, it is with incredible honor and humility that for the first time on the floor of this house, we are so thrilled to welcome former United States Capitol Police Sergeant Aquino Gonell and former United States Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=151.0s)]
*  Both of these men were present, physically and verbally attacked, but bravely defended democracy and the United States Capitol against rioters and insurrections on January the 6th, 2021. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=171.0s)]
*  They are traveling the nation and sharing their stories to raise awareness to the threats of democracy in our nation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=187.0s)]
*  Sergeant Gonell and Officer Dunn, please stand. Welcome to the floor of the House. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=196.0s)]
*  So Pennsylvania Republicans, you could have heard it there when she talked about threats to democracy, they not only booed and jeered at Sergeant Gonell and Officer Dunn, many of them actually walked out, according to several lawmakers who were there on the floor. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=205.0s)]
*  Again, it doesn't stop there, right? Whenever any parts of the machinery of law enforcement, state level, federal level, is brought to bear in Donald Trump or his followers, then those folks who are involved in that become the target of violent intimidation and threats. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=217.0s)]
*  Just about always. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=230.0s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=232.0s)]
*  Last week, a Texas man was arrested and charged with threatening an FBI agent involved in the Hunter Biden investigation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=233.0s)]
*  Now to be clear, because this headline you might have seen in the periphery, this man was not a Biden fan angry about the conviction of the president's son. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=239.0s)]
*  No, no, rather, he was a Trump supporter, angry about a slew of false claims about Hunter Biden and the 2020 election. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=248.0s)]
*  And you might say, well, these are just the fringes and there's something to that, but it does go well beyond that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=257.0s)]
*  Last month, Donald Trump's allies in the right wing media went on this crusade against Joe Biden's Department of Justice and the FBI. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=263.0s)]
*  They took a totally standard part of the warrant used for the document search of Mar-a-Lago, and they turned it into an assassination conspiracy theory. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=271.0s)]
*  The Biden administration authorizing the use of deadly force during the FBI's raid on former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in August of 2022. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=281.0s)]
*  They were actually thinking of using deadly force or it's on the table that that might be necessary at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=289.0s)]
*  Authorized armed agents to use deadly force in the Mar-a-Lago raid. That is insane. Is there any justification for that? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=296.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. My mind as a prosecutor goes to maybe they wanted the engagement of physical force. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=306.0s)]
*  Maybe they wanted to come in without FBI, without, you know, DOJ, without all of that identifying so that they could engage in deadly physical force. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=313.0s)]
*  Why was Merrick Garland prepping for a possible, what, shootout? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=321.0s)]
*  Deadly force. Does that mean that Joe Biden was authorizing the FBI to, if it came to that and he resisted arrest, it would be OK to kill Donald Trump? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=326.0s)]
*  That's what it seems. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=339.0s)]
*  That's just a sample of the cover. Right. This got spun up that this was essentially a Biden assassination plot against Donald Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=340.0s)]
*  And of course, Trump himself jumped right on the conspiracy bandwagon. He blasted out a fundraising email trying to make money off it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=348.0s)]
*  Quote, breaking Biden's DOJ was authorized to shoot me. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=355.0s)]
*  Joe Biden was locked and loaded, ready to take me out and put my family in danger. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=359.0s)]
*  Now, as we've seen, as I just told you about the guy who was threatening the FBI agent, those words are obviously very dangerous, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=368.0s)]
*  which is why Special Counsel Jack Smith has asked the judge overseeing the documents case, Aileen Cannon, Trump appointee, to bar Trump from making statements that endanger law enforcement. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=376.0s)]
*  In Smith's second petition, after Judge Aileen Cannon denied his first request for gag order, he writes the former president's deceptive and inflammatory assertions, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=388.0s)]
*  irresponsibly put a target on the backs of the FBI agents involved in this case, as Trump well knows. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=397.0s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. In response, a group of 24 Republican state attorneys general from across the country filed an amicus brief. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=405.0s)]
*  Again, this is a gag order petition in a Florida court, an amicus brief supporting Trump calling Jack Smith's request, quote, presumptively unconstitutional. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=417.0s)]
*  Of course, defending the boss's right to falsely accuse the FBI of an assassination plot against him, tangibly endangering lives, is just now what you do in the Trump crime family. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPodWhIYEks&t=427.0s)]
