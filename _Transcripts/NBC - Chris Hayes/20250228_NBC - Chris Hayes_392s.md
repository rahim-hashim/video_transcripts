# ‘A mugging’: Blumenthal slams Trump’s attack on Zelenskyy as ‘pathetic ambush’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4)
*  Purging the civil service, deputizing billionaire oligarchs, using the DOJ to settle scores, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=0.0s)]
*  now getting into a yelling match with the Ukrainian president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=5.12s)]
*  Donald Trump appears to be Putinizing the American presidency at a very rapid pace. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=8.28s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Richard Blumenthal of Democratic Connecticut, part of a bipartisan [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  group of senators who met with the Ukrainian president earlier today before Donald Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=16.04s)]
*  kicked him out. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=19.92s)]
*  I want to ask you about that meeting. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=20.92s)]
*  But first, just on that story I was talking about, which has not kind of blown up into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=22.2s)]
*  in the way the Eric Adams scandal was, but has very similar contours in so far as the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  kind of huge red flag of the line attorneys, the professionals being like, I can't do this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=32.16s)]
*  But to me is even worse in so far as it represents the Justice Department being used as not a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=36.96s)]
*  shield, not protecting someone, but as a sword. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=42.94s)]
*  Both are terrifying. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=48.44s)]
*  And especially to one like myself, a former prosecutor, U.S. attorney and attorney general [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=50.14s)]
*  for the state of Connecticut for 20 years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=57.14s)]
*  An investigation, a prosecution, charges, an indictment can ruin lives. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=59.02s)]
*  And the weaponization of justice smacks of Stalinist Russia. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=66.58s)]
*  As Stalin's chief of his secret police said, show me the man and I'll show you the crime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=73.9s)]
*  That's the way the so-called justice system operated in that autocracy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=79.89999999999999s)]
*  We are facing the same terrifying weaponization of justice here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=84.78s)]
*  I know that you've written to the acting U.S. attorney for D.C., Ed Martin, who seems to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  be quite a character about some of what he's said. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  And he is only acting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=99.13999999999999s)]
*  Personally, I think that some of these are impeachable offenses from officers in the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=100.78s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=104.33999999999999s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=105.33999999999999s)]
*  I have much trust in the current Republican Congress. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=106.34s)]
*  You met, I think Roger Wicker, was he in a meeting with you today? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  He was. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so Roger Wicker, who is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, Mississippi [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  senator, he posted this picture. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=117.78s)]
*  It was saying that the deal was a huge step forward in securing mutual prosperity and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=122.06s)]
*  peace for Americans and Ukrainians. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=125.62s)]
*  It was a picture of him shaking hands with Zelensky. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=128.3s)]
*  He then deleted that post afterwards. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=132.54s)]
*  What was the bipartisan meeting like? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=135.04s)]
*  The bipartisan meeting was extremely positive. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=136.88s)]
*  We were on one side, he on the other, ten of us, bipartisan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=140.48s)]
*  And he was hailed as a hero. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=144.92s)]
*  Zelensky was ready, willing, and able to sign that agreement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=147.76s)]
*  And what was most striking, Chris, is the recognition that we have a mutual and common [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=151.12s)]
*  interest with Ukraine, defending democracy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=156.98s)]
*  Putin will keep going against other democracies if he's not stopped in Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=161.24s)]
*  And this mineral deal, I happen to differ with the underlying premise that Ukraine should [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  be paying America. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  We should be thanking Ukraine and we should be helping it without demanding an exploitive [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  deal in this way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=180.12s)]
*  But there was support for the deal and Zelensky clearly was ready, willing, and able to sign it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=181.72s)]
*  I want to play what Senator Lindsey Graham was saying, I think it was at Munich. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=186.24s)]
*  Were you in Munich? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=193.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=194.24s)]
*  So Munich's the big security conference, a bunch of US senators go. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=195.24s)]
*  I believe this original sound is from Munich, February 14th, I think that's right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=197.8s)]
*  This is him talking about Zelensky just two weeks ago and then talking about what happened [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=201.68s)]
*  today in the Oval Office. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=206.8s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  I want to tell you and your people, you're the ally I've been hoping for all my life. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Well one American has died defending Ukraine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=214.96s)]
*  You've taken our weapons and you've kicked their ass. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=218.4s)]
*  And I'm very proud to have you as our ally. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=221.68s)]
*  So would I think complete utter disaster. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=224.36s)]
*  What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don't know if we can ever do business [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=229.0s)]
*  with Zelensky again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=234.4s)]
*  He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with or he needs [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=236.56s)]
*  to change. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=242.12s)]
*  How do you take this guy seriously? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=243.52s)]
*  Lindsey Graham was right two weeks ago. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=246.28s)]
*  I was in the room in Munich when he said that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Lindsey Graham and I have traveled to Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=250.36s)]
*  I've been there six times. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=253.88s)]
*  And every time I've been there, Zelensky has exemplified the courage and strength of his [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  people beginning right after the invasion when they pushed the Russians back, belittling [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=263.48s)]
*  and demeaning a hero. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=271.18s)]
*  He is really a hero and he'll be more of a hero now in Ukraine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=273.94s)]
*  Well, what do you, I mean look, there's probably 80 US senators, I would say, probably 80 to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=278.14s)]
*  85 that would in a secret ballot basically support Zelensky, support US weapons, support [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=283.3s)]
*  security guarantees, want to give them the strongest hand possible in any negotiations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=293.38s)]
*  That's not the position of the president of the United States and the leader of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=298.18s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  He wants to give part of Ukraine to Putin. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=301.32s)]
*  He likes Putin. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=304.48s)]
*  He doesn't like Ukraine and Zelensky. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=305.48s)]
*  He likes the authoritarian model. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't like democracies. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=309.14s)]
*  I'm done asking like when Republican senators are going to speak up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=310.58s)]
*  They're not going to, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=313.86s)]
*  So now what happens? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=315.32s)]
*  Well, first, you're absolutely right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=316.32s)]
*  There's a through line here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=318.26s)]
*  Trump's sycophancy to Putin, whether Helsinki or today, and the Republican sycophancy to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=321.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=328.16s)]
*  But what we need to do is mobilize the American people who truly believe in Zelensky. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  It's one thing to be looking for gratitude. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  It's another to be demanding groveling, which is what they did today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=342.72s)]
*  And it was a pathetic ambush, I think a mugging, a bait and switch. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  They invited Zelensky to come. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=353.72s)]
*  He was ready to sign this agreement, which favors the United States. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=355.46s)]
*  And they, in effect, ambushed him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  So I think we need a mutuality of interest to be recognized here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  Senator Richard Blumenfall, Connecticut, thank you for your time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=370.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbKoDlxBUI4&t=385.34s)]
