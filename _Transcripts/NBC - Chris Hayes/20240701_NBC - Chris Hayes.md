# Lawrence reveals the ‘very bad news’ for Trump in the immunity decision
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc)
*  We are, as I said, expecting the President of the United States to issue an address, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=0.0s)]
*  to give a live address today from the White House in response to Supreme Court ruling, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=3.72s)]
*  something that's extremely rare that should be happening just in a little bit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=8.52s)]
*  We will, of course, bring that to you when that happens. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=13.08s)]
*  I want to bring in Joy Reid, whose hour this is, and I'm sure has a lot to say about today's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=15.68s)]
*  momentous 6-3 decision from the Roberts Court. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=20.36s)]
*  Joy? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=22.92s)]
*  Hey, Chris. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was something to read today, both the decision and the dissent. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=24.92s)]
*  And I guess the sort of best way for me to kind of sum it up is, I don't know if everyone [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  here watches Game of Thrones, but if you're a Game of Thrones fan, you will note that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=35.28s)]
*  in Westeros, there is a king, and then there is the hand of the king. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=40.84s)]
*  And when the king is very young or very old or very mad, the hand of the king is effectively [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  the king. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=51.0s)]
*  And what I think you saw in this ruling today was the Supreme Court declare their preferred [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=52.48s)]
*  president, of course, because they know no Democrat would exercise these powers in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  way they would very much like their next president to. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=62.08s)]
*  They've declared the president and former presidents to be kings. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=66.24s)]
*  But they've also declared themselves the hand of the king. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=70.0s)]
*  This is the key part I just want to read. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=72.28s)]
*  This is from page 110 from the dissent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=74.0s)]
*  This is from Katanji Brown Jackson's dissent, Justice Jackson, with its adoption of a paradigm [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=78.0s)]
*  that sometimes exempts the president from the dictates of the law when the court says [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=82.24s)]
*  so. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=86.44s)]
*  This court has effectively snatched from the legislature the authority to bind the president [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=87.6s)]
*  or not to Congress's mandates, and it has also thereby substantially augmented the power [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=92.08s)]
*  of both the office of the presidency and itself. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  What John Roberts said today is that he and his five fellow Leonard Leo appointees will [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=101.96s)]
*  decide when the president has erred. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=108.56s)]
*  They will decide when he has stepped beyond the bounds of official acts, and only they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=110.92s)]
*  can make that decision. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  They are the hand of the king. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=116.72s)]
*  And the last thing I will say is that they repeatedly call for boldness and decisive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=119.6s)]
*  action, that we need to see boldness and decisive action, and that only absolute immunity and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=123.92s)]
*  presumed immunity can give a president such boldness. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=129.4s)]
*  One wonders then how previous presidents have figured out how to implement the Trail of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  tears and force indigenous people to march along with enslaved people across this country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=139.12s)]
*  mainly to their deaths. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  How President Lincoln essentially deleted the human property, $10 billion worth of human [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=144.36s)]
*  property from every state in rebellion by fiat. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=150.66000000000003s)]
*  How presidents, let's talk about the presidents in the 20th century. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=154.68s)]
*  Harry Truman unleashed a nuclear holocaust on two parts of Japan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=158.4s)]
*  He did that boldly and decisively without fear of prosecution. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=164.88s)]
*  How then does a new president, a future president, need such boldness to come from the fiat of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  the Supreme Court? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=174.48s)]
*  Yeah, there has been no lack of boldness and decisiveness from American presidents and executives [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=175.96s)]
*  through the years, particularly when operating in the conduct of war, particularly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=181.68s)]
*  Andrew, I think this has been a shocking trajectory for you, particularly as someone who knows [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=186.56s)]
*  the law quite well and the Department of Justice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=191.92s)]
*  What was your reaction to this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=194.04s)]
*  Well, I definitely agreed with Rachel that I just did not expect that there would be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=195.04s)]
*  five votes for this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=200.28s)]
*  This is a watershed moment, big picture. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  I just want to make sure people understand with respect to the Department of Justice [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=207.12s)]
*  on pages 20 and 21, the decision makes it absolutely clear even if there is a known [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=210.84s)]
*  sham prosecution, that is off limits. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=217.76s)]
*  If you have a president, let's say who is on tape, saying bring a false prosecution, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=221.44s)]
*  cannot prosecute. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=227.8s)]
*  No matter how strong the evidence is, and this is not a hypothetical because you actually [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=229.84s)]
*  have people talking about it right now about weaponizing if they get back into office. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=234.4s)]
*  That part is just so anathema to the idea of a rule of law when you're talking about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=240.4s)]
*  Department of Justice that the whole principle is to be separate and independent and not [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=246.12s)]
*  be sort of have a norm of not in fact obeying what the president says you have to do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=252.32s)]
*  I think the whole piece of this where the legal intersects actually collides violently [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=260.68s)]
*  with the political is that in 2016, Trump was, you could go back and say maybe there [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  were other reasons to run. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=272.44s)]
*  In 2024, that's not the case. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=273.6s)]
*  The only reason he's running is for retribution and the only way Trump defines retribution [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  is official. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=279.8s)]
*  He wants to use official access. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't want private retribution. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=282.6s)]
*  Forget about us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=283.6s)]
*  Forget about the free press's analysis of something that the justices actually wrote [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=287.92s)]
*  down and put in writing, which is that we do now have a king. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  That's radical and amazing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  But we also have a guy running for president who is today ahead in the polls who is running [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=295.88s)]
*  to take official acts to seek out in his words retribution against his political enemies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=300.5s)]
*  He is only interested in the official parts of the job and he only ever was. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=304.86s)]
*  I mean, the only reason he wanted a Roy Cohen to pick up on Rachel's point is so that he [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=309.7s)]
*  could have someone architect the White House around officially seeking out punishment for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=314.02s)]
*  his enemies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=319.82s)]
*  2017, there was a story in the New York Times that he wanted to prosecute Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=320.82s)]
*  He fired Jim Comey because he doesn't, quote, see to it to let Mike Flynn go, let Mike Flynn [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=324.06s)]
*  go. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=327.82s)]
*  He never wanted to commit crimes disguised as official acts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=328.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=332.54s)]
*  I mean, I think he said this publicly a thousand times to Nicole's point. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=333.54s)]
*  And I was reading today, if anybody's following along on the lovely Project 2025 plan on page [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  560. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=344.02s)]
*  This is the first line of that part. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=345.02s)]
*  The next conservative administration should embrace the Constitution and understand the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=347.5s)]
*  obligation of the executive branch to use its independent resources and authorities [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=351.1s)]
*  to restrain the excesses of both the legislative and judicial branches. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the plan that Steve Bannon has been holding up in his recent interviews before [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=359.66s)]
*  he went to jail today, of course, to say this is what we're going to do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=363.74s)]
*  And the justices, what they did today is basically, I mean, I worked for two presidents, Nicole [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=367.26s)]
*  worked for a president. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=371.06s)]
*  You haven't needed this immunity in the past. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=372.18s)]
*  There have been bad things that have happened under presidents. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=375.66s)]
*  But like they haven't, they've been restricting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  Right, but they've done the bad things even without. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  They've done the bad things even without. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  Nobody's walking around waiting for the immunity. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  The presidents I worked for didn't wait, didn't meet, didn't look for the immunity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=385.1s)]
*  And now you have the person, so you're asking the American public, to Rachel's point, to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=388.86s)]
*  vote for people and trust the presidents they elect will have the morality and the benevolence [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=393.46s)]
*  to not abuse. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=399.5s)]
*  That's essentially what they're doing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=400.86s)]
*  So the very bad news for Donald Trump in this decision today and for candidate Trump, very, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=402.58s)]
*  very bad, is that Mike Pence is going to walk into a federal courtroom, raise his right [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=407.86s)]
*  hand, take an oath to tell the truth and testify against Donald Trump in this case [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=413.18s)]
*  in September. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=420.46s)]
*  It's going to happen much faster. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  You're saying it's an evidentiary hearing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=424.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=425.98s)]
*  So what this is, what this is, is we've created an absolute immunity on one paragraph of the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=426.98s)]
*  indictment, applying to exactly one paragraph of the indictment. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=432.94s)]
*  All of the rest of the indictment goes back to Judge Chutkin's courtroom, and she schedules [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=437.06s)]
*  this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=443.38s)]
*  This Supreme Court has ordered her to have a hearing about the evidence in the case to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=444.38s)]
*  determine whether the act in question is an official act, whether it might have some kind [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=449.58s)]
*  of protection or not. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=455.29999999999995s)]
*  And that's for everything in the case except for one conversation that he had with the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  acting attorney general. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=461.78s)]
*  The Department of Justice. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=462.78s)]
*  So what you're looking at here is basically there'll be some briefs on each side, and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=463.78s)]
*  then the judge will schedule a day and say, OK, we start today. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=469.02s)]
*  Mr. Smith, who's your first witness? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=472.74s)]
*  And it's exactly like a prosecution. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=474.34s)]
*  And for what Jack Smith's going to have to do, and sometimes in pretrial evidentiary [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=476.82s)]
*  stuff, prosecutors don't want to turn over all their cards, he's going to have to turn [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=481.34s)]
*  over every single one of them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=484.78s)]
*  Because the Supreme Court has said to him, in effect, we need to see every single one [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=486.58s)]
*  of your cards. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=491.28s)]
*  So every witness he has, he's going to bring into that courtroom. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=492.28s)]
*  They're all going to be under oath, and the defense is going to be able to cross-examine [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=497.24s)]
*  them. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  The defense probably won't bring in any witnesses at all. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  But you're going to see this incredible January 6 hearing on steroids, possibly for six, eight [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=504.88s)]
*  weeks, September, October maybe. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=512.16s)]
*  Quickly, Andrew, do you think that's going to happen? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=514.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=517.64s)]
*  I'd always thought the sort of silver lining, but it's a small one because the big picture [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=518.64s)]
*  here is this decision is horrendous for American democracy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=523.3s)]
*  But Lawrence is right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=526.76s)]
*  There is going to be a hearing, and the Supreme Court has actually said there has to be. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=527.76s)]
*  So obviously there's going to be a lot of fighting about the timing of it, but Judge [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=532.16s)]
*  Chuckin does not have to wait the 81 days that she said she would wait for the trial. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a hearing, so she can have briefing and she can set up a hearing with witnesses [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=541.48s)]
*  who are called. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=545.64s)]
*  Joy, just before we go to break, there's also the, to your point earlier about the sort [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=546.64s)]
*  of clarity of this or the stakes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=551.4s)]
*  The one thing I was thinking about too, and this is Rachel's point, is just how clarifying [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=554.76s)]
*  this is about the stakes of the election. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=559.12s)]
*  To the extent there's some activating small d democratic energy that can be brought out [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  of what I think is a genuinely appalling move by the court. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=565.28s)]
*  I wonder if you feel the same way about that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  It's very clarifying. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=572.2s)]
*  They might as well have added, by the way, please Google Project 2025 because we are [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=573.32s)]
*  essentially authorizing and not just authorizing, really sort of calling on Donald Trump. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=579.12s)]
*  They repeatedly talk about bold and decisive action. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=583.92s)]
*  What bold and decisive action do they have in mind? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=586.92s)]
*  Probably the exact same bold and decisive action the Heritage Foundation has in mind. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=589.64s)]
*  Heritage Action has in mind. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=594.76s)]
*  Leonard Leo has in mind. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  Steve Bannon has in mind. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=597.76s)]
*  And what I think they're saying to the American people is that if we get, we, this Leonard [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Leo stakes, get our preferred president back, we are going to encourage him to break the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=605.24s)]
*  boundaries of the law, to push it to the limit, to feel free to even use violence, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=610.32s)]
*  to use mass incarceration. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=616.0s)]
*  Go ahead and do those camps. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  Do whatever you need to do to take the bold and decisive action that we repeatedly have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  said is necessary for the function of the presidency to get the agenda done. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=623.72s)]
*  And we'll protect you and we'll let you know, Donald Trump, when you've gone too far. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  And only then will you be stopped. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a clarion call to every American. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=635.96s)]
*  By the way, that debate is like 34 felony counts old and it does not matter anymore. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=640.08s)]
*  All that matters is that you do not allow the person back into office who will use this [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=646.44s)]
*  power that he's been given by this court, this imperial court to implement that agenda [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=651.8s)]
*  they wrote down and published because they know that no one will stop them except voters. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=657.56s)]
*  It doesn't matter if Biden is old. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=663.88s)]
*  It don't matter. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=665.44s)]
*  It don't matter if he's old. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=666.44s)]
*  What matters is that the other guy wants to be a king and this court has said, yes, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  you are a king and we are the king's hand. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=673.48s)]
*  And together, the seven of us will rule this country. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_Rkop0noc&t=676.6s)]
