# Bernie Sanders goes off No ‘blank check’ for Netanyahu
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY)
*  It has been over 400 days since the war in Gaza started. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=0.0s)]
*  Since then, 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, nearly 44,000 in Gaza, including [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  over 11,000 children. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=9.8s)]
*  The devastation and destruction in Gaza is just near total, visible from space everywhere [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  you look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=17.8s)]
*  There is rampant hunger and famine and disease. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=18.8s)]
*  Now we're exactly two months away from Donald Trump returning to power. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=22.04s)]
*  It has become abundantly clear that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=24.36s)]
*  and is now biding his time until then. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=29.42s)]
*  In the meantime, in an attempt to block the Biden administration providing more arms to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=32.14s)]
*  Israel, a group of U.S. senators led by independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont is trying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=36.46s)]
*  to stop the $20 billion sale of offensive U.S. reprimand to Israel, arguing that Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=41.02s)]
*  has waged a war on the Palestinian people and that providing additional arms to Israel [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=46.94s)]
*  violates both international and, crucially, U.S. law. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=51.06s)]
*  The United States government cannot provide weapons to countries that violate internationally [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=56.5s)]
*  recognized human rights or block U.S. humanitarian aid. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=64.46s)]
*  That is not my opinion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=71.58s)]
*  That is what the law says. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=74.38s)]
*  A partnership should be a two-way street, not a one-way blank check. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=77.66s)]
*  And at a minimum, the Netanyahu government should comply with American law. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=83.06s)]
*  We must not continue to provide offensive weapons that make the United States complicit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=89.18s)]
*  in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, the injury of 100,000 more innocents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=94.22s)]
*  Now I should say this vote is still ongoing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=102.06s)]
*  We're looking at it live. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=104.62s)]
*  Somewhat remarkably, and we should sort of level set here, this vote was not expected [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  But so far, 18 senators have voted in favor of banning the sale of tank rounds, which [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=112.3s)]
*  is part of the package here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  19 senators have voted to ban the sale of high-explosive mortar rounds. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  Just to give a context here, as we await the possibility of senators joining us, though [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=125.38s)]
*  I don't know if he will be able to, because as you can see, that vote has not gaveled [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=131.94s)]
*  close and his job is to vote. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=136.5s)]
*  You see Mitch McConnell there talking on the floor. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=138.34s)]
*  I want to read from the senators op-ed today, speaking about the war efforts. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=140.86s)]
*  He says, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=147.82s)]
*  There was reporting yesterday that the White House had sent out a memo, a talking point, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=171.78s)]
*  saying that a vote for this resolution would embolden Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=176.22s)]
*  And this is something that the senator responds to in The Washington Post as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=182.9s)]
*  He says, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=186.78s)]
*  You do not effectively combat terrorism by starving thousands of innocent children. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=200.78s)]
*  You do not effectively combat terrorism by bombing schools and hospitals. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=205.7s)]
*  You do not effectively combat terrorism by turning virtually the entire world against [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=209.3s)]
*  your country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=213.02s)]
*  Just for a little bit of context here, I believe we do now have the center in the... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=214.66s)]
*  Just for a little bit of context here, just to give people a sense of the scale of destruction [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=222.98s)]
*  that we've seen in Gaza over the past year and it can be very difficult to communicate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=228.5s)]
*  It's something we've wrestled with. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=231.58s)]
*  I want to just give a sense of children who die in conflict. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=232.58s)]
*  Obviously, children are definitionally should be non-combatants and should not be targeted [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=237.22s)]
*  in war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=242.9s)]
*  In terms of the average number of children casualties, in the Ukraine war, for instance, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=244.78s)]
*  we have a graphic that shows us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=251.38s)]
*  In the case of the war in Ukraine, Russian attacks there... [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=253.5s)]
*  Russian attacks in Ukraine, you see that 500 children have died per year in that war. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=261.82s)]
*  During the Syrian war, which was one of the bloodiest and most catastrophic wars in recent [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=269.22s)]
*  memory, Bashar al-Assad, there were 4,700 deaths a year. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=273.14s)]
*  And in Gaza, we have seen an unprecedented 11,000 deaths of children a year. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=279.9s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders now joins me by phone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=285.5s)]
*  Senator, thanks for joining us in the middle of this vote. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  What's your reaction to how the vote is going? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=292.06s)]
*  Given the kind of opposition we've faced from the Democratic leadership, Senator Schumer, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=295.34s)]
*  from the White House, from AIPAC, the fact that we got a one vote, 19 U.S. senators all [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=300.82s)]
*  within the Democratic caucus to say, no, we're not going to give more money than that to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=306.85999999999996s)]
*  continue this horrific war against the Palestinian people, I feel pretty good about that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  How active were whipping activities by the White House, which put out a statement saying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=319.61999999999995s)]
*  this is a bad idea, opposing it, saying that it would essentially benefit groups like Hamas [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=325.14s)]
*  and Hezbollah? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I don't know exactly because they didn't quite calm me up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=331.97999999999996s)]
*  But I could tell you that Senator Schumer was very active in AIPAC, which put $100 million [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=335.42s)]
*  into the last campaign, including defeating Democrats in primaries. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=341.38s)]
*  They were very active as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=345.86s)]
*  I can't help but notice, as is often the case on votes like this, that while you did get [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  18 colleagues in the Democratic caucus, not a single Republican has voted for this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  And I can't imagine a single Republican will. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  What do you think that augurs for what the posture of the incoming administration and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=359.82s)]
*  Congress will be? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=364.42s)]
*  Well, I think the Republicans are making the bet that they will win Jewish support in this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=365.42s)]
*  country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=372.74s)]
*  I'm not so sure they're right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=373.74s)]
*  According to a poll from J Street, 62 percent of the Jewish people that they poll oppose [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  giving more money to Netanyahu unless he agrees to an immediate ceasefire. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=383.26s)]
*  And by the way, I just don't think that the average American feels very good about putting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=388.86s)]
*  billions of dollars into an Israeli government which is starving thousands and thousands [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=393.66s)]
*  of children. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't care whether you're Democrat, Republican, progressive, conservative. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't think people feel good about that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  So I would say that the Republicans are making a guess. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=407.1s)]
*  I think they're going to lose on that bet. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you a question, and I don't want you to betray any confidences so you [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  can sort of speak in general terms. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=416.18s)]
*  But I can't help but know there are votes here in support of your resolution that wouldn't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=417.66s)]
*  have necessarily been there three or six months ago. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=421.38s)]
*  I think it's fair to say there are more votes now than there would have been. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=423.78s)]
*  And can you characterize to what you attribute that movement in the conversations you've [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  had with your colleagues? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=431.78s)]
*  I think growing frustration with the fact that we are putting billions of dollars into [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=432.78s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=440.02s)]
*  We have always conditioned, have conditions on military aid. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=442.14s)]
*  If you want U.S. military aid, you cannot starve children. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=448.26s)]
*  You cannot bomb schools. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think the American people and members of the Democratic caucus are seeing Netanyahu [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=458.02s)]
*  take the money and reject every proposal coming from the Biden administration or anybody else [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=464.14s)]
*  to protect civilian lives. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=472.68s)]
*  So I think that is the bottom line as to why we're seeing more and more opposition to military [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=474.58s)]
*  support of Israel. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=480.9s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, who has led that floor effort today that we've been covering, thank [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  you very much, Senator. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=486.46s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJBmupl-oY&t=487.46s)]
