# Hayes: Tricia Cotham owes an explanation to North Carolina on abortion vote
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE)
*  House has overridden the governor's veto and the bill becomes law not withstanding the governor's objections somebody notified [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=0.0s)]
*  That was a moment last night when North Carolina's Republican supermajority [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=13.32s)]
*  Overrode the Democratic governor's veto and instituted a 12-week abortion ban all abortions after 12 weeks after that first trimester [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=18.44s)]
*  Starting in July people in North Carolina will not have access to that abortion care and despite the fact [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=27.2s)]
*  This is a devastating blow to abortion access both in the state and across the South [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=32.1s)]
*  Republicans are trying to brand this as a compromise [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=37.04s)]
*  There were certainly a lot on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=40.6s)]
*  My side of the aisle who felt like a six-week bill likes being debated in South Carolina other states would be more appropriate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=42.8s)]
*  And then of course there's some that wanted more weeks than 12 and so the compromise came down to 12 weeks [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=49.18s)]
*  There are so many extra [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=55.08s)]
*  Restrictions packed onto this bill that make it really hard to get care before 12 weeks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=57.68s)]
*  So I would really push back strongly against that narrative that this is any sort of compromise approach [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=63.48s)]
*  I mean listen talk about compromise they rolled back a right women had had in this country for 50 years [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=68.92s)]
*  That's the starting point. Okay and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=74.88s)]
*  Banning abortion at 12 weeks isn't even popular in the state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=77.8s)]
*  Recent poll showed that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=81.52s)]
*  57% of North Carolina voters 57% either support the state's current 20-week ban or would expand it meaning further out than 20 weeks [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=83.04s)]
*  only [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=90.72s)]
*  35% just over a third of voters wanted to restrict access to 15 weeks or less and they went lower than that and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=91.88s)]
*  Here's the thing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=99.0s)]
*  North Carolina is not a dyed-in-the-wool red Republican state. It's basically a 50-50 state [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=100.68s)]
*  They have a Democratic governor Roy Cooper [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=106.6s)]
*  They have a Democratic secretary of state and attorney general Donald Trump won the state in 2020 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=108.44s)]
*  Narrowly look at that less than 50% of the vote. It's a pretty evenly state [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=113.72s)]
*  Split state and yet and yet and yet through aggressive gerrymandering [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=118.2s)]
*  Republicans have been able to secure a majority in both houses of legislature [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=123.24s)]
*  Even as they lost the governor's mansion twice in a row [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=126.72s)]
*  But even that gerrymandering couldn't get them the super majority that they would need to do things like Institute a veto proof [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=129.76s)]
*  abortion ban [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=137.28s)]
*  What allowed them to do that is one person? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=138.6s)]
*  state representative Trisha Cotten [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=142.16s)]
*  Last year Cotten ran to represent the 112th district as a Democrat [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=145.56s)]
*  She pledged during her campaign to oppose further restrictions on abortion [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=150.96s)]
*  She was backed by Emily's List which works to support women candidates who are pro abortion rights [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=155.96s)]
*  and she won that seat with 59% of the vote and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  Then when she got to the legislature [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=165.8s)]
*  She fulfilled her campaign promise by signing on as a co-sponsor to a bill that would codify Roe v [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=167.56s)]
*  Wade's abortion protections in the state of North Carolina [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  In fact on the state houses website to this day. She is still listed on the bill as a co-sponsor [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=177.56s)]
*  But in April just five months after she was elected as a Democrat who wanted to secure abortion rights out of the blue [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Trisha Cotten switched parties and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  That switch of parties it was that decision and her vote that then turned the Republican majority of North Carolina into a super majority [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=196.76s)]
*  Here's her incredibly roundabout non-explanation for why she took such a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=206.48s)]
*  catastrophically [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  consequential step to become a Republican I [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=214.76s)]
*  Have decided to change my party affiliation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=218.36s)]
*  Joining the Republican Party and have been welcomed with open arms by my colleagues this now where we are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  modern-day Democratic Party has become [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=230.8s)]
*  Unrecognizable to me and to so many others throughout this state and this country [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=234.8s)]
*  The party wants to villainize anyone who has free thought [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=241.28000000000003s)]
*  Free judgment has solutions who wants to get to work to better our state [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=247.36s)]
*  Did someone roast you really bad on Twitter and then you changed your party? Is that what happened? I [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=254.52s)]
*  Mean state representative Cotham never addressed why she changed for everything about the Democratic Party. Let's say she's right about that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=261.88s)]
*  Why did she change her position on abortion? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Fine, you're a Republican now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=271.76s)]
*  Why did you change your abortion position so radically like what changed in five months? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=274.2s)]
*  From a Democrat who has spoken movingly about her own abortion and reproductive rights who supports codifying Roe v [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=282.2s)]
*  Wade who's a co-sponsor on legislation listed on the state website to this day to a Republican who voted to override a congressional of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=289.52s)]
*  Governorial veto for a 12-week abortion ban that only a third of voters want [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=297.36s)]
*  What happened we got nothing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=302.68s)]
*  She owes that explanation to the people of her state to the voters in the 112th district who sent a Democrat [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=307.2s)]
*  Who wanted to protect Roe and abortion to the statehouse a woman who just put a 12-week abortion ban on the books? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=313.76s)]
*  You [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swen8O6wqHE&t=331.8s)]
