# Raskin reacts to Trump saying Jan. 6 committee members ‘should go to jail’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag)
*  Six months after the insurrection on the Capitol, the House Select Committee on January 6 was formed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a bipartisan effort with seven Democrats and two Republicans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=5.5s)]
*  For about a year and a half, the committee made its case to the public in televised hearings [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=9.5s)]
*  that then President Donald Trump fomented a coup to overthrow our democracy after his defeat in 2020. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=13.5s)]
*  American carnage. That's Donald Trump's true legacy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=20.5s)]
*  His desire to overthrow the people's election and seize the presidency interrupted the counting of electoral college votes for the first time in American history, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=25.0s)]
*  nearly toppled the constitutional order, and brutalized hundreds and hundreds of people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=35.0s)]
*  The Watergate break-in was like a Cub Scout meeting compared to this assault on our people and our institutions. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=42.0s)]
*  Now we're just a month away from Trump taking the oath, and already he's very clear-eyed on what he would like to do to those who served on that select committee. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=50.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Drillability of Drills. Joining me now is someone who was on that January 6 committee, Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=80.5s)]
*  Congressman Raskin is also running unopposed to be the top Democrat in the House Judiciary Committee. That should happen soon. Congressman, good to have you in the program. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=86.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, Chris. I had not seen that footage before, and it's a relief to hear him say he's focusing on drill baby drill and not jail baby jail. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=95.5s)]
*  Well, I don't know how seriously either you or I take him saying that. I mean, obviously the threats of jail at some point are ludicrous, like jail for what? People don't just get thrown in jail. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=103.0s)]
*  But I guess, you know, given the fact this first interview he had with Kristen Welker this weekend, it's clear that the finish the job of January 6, meaning pardon the folks who have been convicted and who are in prison for it, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=113.0s)]
*  go after people on the committee, is still what he wants to do. What is your preparation for that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=128.5s)]
*  Well, under the American rule of law, people are sent to jail only after having been convicted by a unanimous jury of their peers for having committed a criminal offense. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=137.5s)]
*  And then the prosecution has to satisfy the burden of proving that they committed every element of that offense, and then they're sent to jail. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=152.0s)]
*  So you don't go to jail simply because a president considers you a political foe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=159.0s)]
*  And so, you know, one of the tragedies of what he's doing is that he's miseducating a lot of people, a lot of young people in the country, about how our justice system works. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=165.0s)]
*  Well, I think he's modeling how he would like it to work, which brings us to the question of Christopher Wray's resignation today. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=177.5s)]
*  First, your reaction to Wray's decision, which a lot of people feel, you know, Senator Blumenthal said it was essentially obeying in advance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=183.5s)]
*  I've seen other criticisms of that sort. What do you think? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=192.5s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, it does seem to violate Tim Snyder's principle number one, don't obey in advance. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=196.0s)]
*  But look, we need people who are ready for the fight, and there are people who are exhausted by it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=204.0s)]
*  There are people who have been worn out and demoralized, and we just need new generations of pro-democracy, pro-freedom patriots to take the roles that, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=211.0s)]
*  that need to be occupied in order to defend our constitutional order against these people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=222.5s)]
*  So, you know, I thank him for his service. I wish he had hung around for a few years and forced Donald Trump to fire him for the imaginary offenses that are floating around in his mind. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=226.5s)]
*  But apparently he didn't want to go through that for whatever reason, and he might have good reasons for it. It's hard to know. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=240.5s)]
*  The main thing is we just need to be mobilizing people to get ready for this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=247.0s)]
*  And, you know, the new FBI director, designate anyway, is a pure political sycophant whose political philosophy is embodied in a children's book that he wrote about King Donald, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=251.0s)]
*  whose hero is Cash, who is the protector of King Donald, who fights off Queen, I think Hillary Quinton was the name of the comic book hero in this comic book vision of American politics. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=268.5s)]
*  So, you know, there is a jovial and absurdist quality to these people, but they're taking over the most powerful institutions in the government. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=283.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess I feel there's two things. It seems to me that there's a certain line of thinking among Democrats, excuse me, which is that the sort of 100% resistance posture last time didn't work and has been discredited, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=292.0s)]
*  and that arguments about democracy fell flat with the electorate, so no one wants to hear it, save it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=307.5s)]
*  And I just like, I just wonder what, what are all you going to do? What's everyone doing here? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=314.5s)]
*  As the incoming president is making very obvious noises and very obvious actual decisions designed to subvert the American rule of law and basically finish the project that he started on January 1st. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=321.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, we lost an election by around three million votes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=337.5s)]
*  Joe Biden had beaten Donald Trump four years before that by more than seven million votes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=343.5s)]
*  So obviously the country is closely divided. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=349.5s)]
*  And so we're going to alter some tactics and strategies and figure out how the right has captured a lot of the social media. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=352.5s)]
*  And I think we have been outflanked there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=362.0s)]
*  There was nothing wrong with the massive ground game in the door knocking and the canvassing that took place in the election. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=364.0s)]
*  But there are clearly some changes that need to be made. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=370.0s)]
*  We're not going to change our values. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=373.0s)]
*  We're not going to abandon American constitutional democracy because we lost an election by 1% or one and a half percent. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=375.0s)]
*  We're not going to abandon the rule of law. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=383.0s)]
*  We're going to be recruiting and mobilizing hundreds of thousands of millions of more people to get out there and be leaders in this fight. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=385.5s)]
*  What else can we do? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=391.5s)]
*  This is not a game of volleyball or badminton where we're going to quit the game or something. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=392.5s)]
*  I mean, this is the fight of our lives that we're in now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=398.5s)]
*  All right, Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=401.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfESX1ZLag&t=415.0s)]
