# ‘Humiliation parade’ DeSantis, Haley speak at RNC after Trump’s relentless attacks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0)
*  You mentioned the theme of tonight, Chris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm into themes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=2.0s)]
*  The official theme, as you say, is make America safe once again. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=3.5s)]
*  But judging by the speakers' list tonight could just have easily been called the night of a thousand humiliations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=8.0s)]
*  Prime time speakers, as you may know, include two of Trump's fiercest Republican primary opponents, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=15.0s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=21.0s)]
*  Now, while losing candidates often speak at the victors' convention, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=25.0s)]
*  Trump's humiliation of these particular rivals reached a different order of magnitude during the Republican primary. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=29.0s)]
*  The problem with Ron DeSantis is that he needs a personality transplant. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=38.0s)]
*  He's not a talented politician, obviously. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=43.0s)]
*  Ron DeSantis was walking off the stage and his feet, it's weird. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=45.0s)]
*  Because his cowboy boots, so they have a high heel outside, but inside you got a big deal going on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=51.0s)]
*  And he's walking like... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=58.0s)]
*  After mocking Governor DeSantis for allegedly wearing lifts in his cowboy boots, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=63.0s)]
*  DeSantis eventually dropped out and Trump focused his attentions on Nikki Haley, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=68.0s)]
*  who in the closing hours of her candidacy called Trump not qualified to be president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=72.0s)]
*  Trump, in return, zeroed in on Haley's race, suggesting her parents' status as immigrants from India [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=78.0s)]
*  might somehow disqualify her from the presidency. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=83.0s)]
*  Trump misstated Haley's given name, Nimrada, repeatedly calling her Nimbra and Nimrada. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=87.0s)]
*  And he explained to Fox News that those mistakes were definitely intentional. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=94.0s)]
*  She says that you're using a nickname based on her given name, Nimrada. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=100.0s)]
*  You called her Nimbra in a post the other day. Why do you do that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=105.0s)]
*  I do that with a lot of people. With her it's just something that came. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=108.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of a takeoff on her name, you know, her name, wherever she may come from. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=111.0s)]
*  Wherever she may come from. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=116.0s)]
*  In addition to the thinly veiled xenophobia, Trump also engaged in explicit misogyny, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=117.0s)]
*  calling South Carolina's first female governor essentially a bimbo. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=122.0s)]
*  But if you think that bird brain, I mean Nikki, becomes president, she's not tough enough, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=128.0s)]
*  she's not smart enough, and she wasn't respected enough, she cannot do this job. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=133.0s)]
*  Despite the never before heard humiliations and apparently significant reservations last week, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=139.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley released the 97 delegates she won during this year's Republican primary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=145.0s)]
*  so that they in turn could vote for Donald Trump yesterday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=150.0s)]
*  And tonight both Haley and DeSantis are choosing to publicly pledge loyalty to Donald Trump, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=153.0s)]
*  despite the fact that Donald Trump does not plan to meet with either of them this evening [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=159.0s)]
*  even after they address his convention. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, not even bothering to meet with them is really just the last humiliation maybe? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=166.0s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean one of the things I find fascinating about this, and we've seen it time after time after time, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=173.0s)]
*  JD Vance of course being one of the most extreme examples, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=176.0s)]
*  this sort of trajectory of supplication, of submissiveness, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=179.0s)]
*  Of these sort of politics of domination where you make fun of someone, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=184.0s)]
*  you cow them, you bully them, and then they sort of end up, you know, kneeling before you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=187.0s)]
*  And this happens time and time and time again, and it's a huge part of the sort of Trump mystique and schtick [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=192.0s)]
*  within the base that he's the powerful one, he's the sort of dominant one. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=197.0s)]
*  What I find remarkable is there's these two twin impulses in any human psychology like these folks, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=201.0s)]
*  which is ambition and ego and self-regard, and it's wild to watch. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=207.0s)]
*  They're very divorced from one another in this particular, yes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=213.0s)]
*  That's my point, they're in total war with each other. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=215.0s)]
*  In a weird way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=217.0s)]
*  What I find remarkable is to watch, I just feel like, just speaking for myself, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=218.0s)]
*  like I don't have it in me to humiliate myself that way because my ego's too big and I have too much vanity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=223.0s)]
*  What I find amazing is that they don't, they just, everyone, and you, I will say, Alex Wagner, sitting at this desk, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=232.0s)]
*  or actually another desk, you were like, Haley's going to fall in line on those primaries. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=239.0s)]
*  I have to say, I was the naysayer, I didn't believe it, I don't understand what the point of her candidacy was. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=243.0s)]
*  I know someone who does understand me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=249.0s)]
*  Fearless forecaster. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=251.0s)]
*  Yes, someone who does. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=252.0s)]
*  Joining us now live from the arena there in Milwaukee, McKay Coppin, staff writer for The Atlantic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=254.0s)]
*  McKay, let me ask you this first because Alex made this point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=260.0s)]
*  So this is always the case at conventions, that there are unity events, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=263.0s)]
*  and particularly after contested primaries, they feature the other contestants, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=268.0s)]
*  So that is part of what a convention is for, right, that we're all rallying behind the nominee, and look, we have all these people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=273.0s)]
*  In 2016, Ted Cruz famously did not do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=280.0s)]
*  I was actually inside watching him give that speech when he said, vote your conscience. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=283.0s)]
*  It does feel like there is an added dimension, though, here and now in Milwaukee and in the modern Republican Party [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=287.0s)]
*  that's above and beyond just the normal falling in line. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=294.0s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=299.0s)]
*  As you two were talking, I was thinking about how in some ways this feels like the same story we've been doing for eight years, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=301.0s)]
*  This story of dominance and submission, of humiliation, of abject loyalty tests. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=310.0s)]
*  We've been talking about this since 2016. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=316.0s)]
*  But I was thinking back to that convention in 2016. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=318.0s)]
*  I was there too. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=321.0s)]
*  And there were still, back then, signs of kind of the fractiousness within the party. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=322.0s)]
*  You know, Ted Cruz famously did not endorse Trump during his speech. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=329.0s)]
*  You had Mike Lee, along with the Utah delegation, on the floor screaming their protests to Trump's formal nomination. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=334.0s)]
*  There were signs that there was still some resistance to Trump. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=343.0s)]
*  And at the time, I will admit to this, you know, as a reporter who had covered the Republican Party pretty extensively, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=347.0s)]
*  I was sort of naively surprised for the same reasons that you just laid out, that people like Paul Ryan, like Marco Rubio, had been so willing to fall in line. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=354.0s)]
*  Eight years later, I'm not surprised. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=365.0s)]
*  And I will say I've been at this convention for a couple days. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=367.0s)]
*  And there is no sign of resistance. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=370.0s)]
*  There is no sign of fractiousness within the party. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=374.0s)]
*  Everybody is completely in lockstep with Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=377.0s)]
*  And the handful of Republicans out there who are not just didn't show up in Milwaukee. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=380.0s)]
*  That's the difference, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=385.0s)]
*  Like, if you are not fully on board, you just don't come and you're really not participating in the National Party. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=386.0s)]
*  I want to bring in Tim Miller, who once served as the spokesman for the RNC. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=393.0s)]
*  He's now, of course, a writer at large for the bulwark and one of our most trusted soothsayers, seers on all things Republican. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=397.0s)]
*  Tim, you know, McKay makes a point about what the sort of the humiliation process is different and more extraordinary this go round when it comes to people like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=404.0s)]
*  But with her, the Nikki Haley voter, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=415.0s)]
*  Like, they're up until the end of this primary period. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=417.0s)]
*  There were still people that weren't voting for Donald Trump in those Republican primaries. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=420.0s)]
*  Do they do they to capitulate? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=425.0s)]
*  I mean, do you have a sense that that resistance even exists anymore? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=427.0s)]
*  Chris is nodding yes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=430.0s)]
*  I think they're divided like the Nikki Haley voter was like basically three different types of people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=431.0s)]
*  Something I kept trying to say during the primary like she's getting 21 percent. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=437.0s)]
*  That means 21 percent of Republicans are for us like it was about eight percent probably of Republicans that might go back to Trump and then eight percent of my people, former Republicans that are like still registered distigily from the past that voted for Joe Biden already in 2020. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=440.0s)]
*  And then like five percent of political obsessive Democrats and independents who crossed over because they hate Donald Trump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=454.0s)]
*  Super frisked. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=460.0s)]
*  Right. Super frisked. Sickos. Real sickos. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=461.0s)]
*  We say this lovingly. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=463.0s)]
*  We call them engaged citizens. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=465.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I literally saw one in one of our focus groups. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=466.0s)]
*  She was like, David Plouffe on MSNBC told me to cross over and so I'm going to do it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=469.0s)]
*  So there's some and that eight percent could very much matter. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=474.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=477.0s)]
*  Right. And I think Nikki Haley speaking to that group tonight is going to offer them a pitch. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=478.0s)]
*  This is where it ties into the J.D. Vance thing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=484.0s)]
*  The J.D. Vance pick was not a move for the Nikki Haley voter. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=486.0s)]
*  It was a move for the other side of the horseshoe. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=490.0s)]
*  You know, running up numbers even more about working class white men running up numbers even more with like younger base voters. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=492.0s)]
*  You know, and based not based voters. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=499.0s)]
*  The Vance pick makes the Haley speech tonight absurd. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=502.0s)]
*  It'll be interesting to watch. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=506.0s)]
*  Good point. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=508.0s)]
*  You know, because she's like, oh, I'm doing this because Donald Trump will still make people safe. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=509.0s)]
*  But it's like he both of them now want to give Ukraine to Putin. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=512.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=515.0s)]
*  Although one of the things I'll say and McKay, I'm curious. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=516.0s)]
*  I mean, we've been listening to some of the speeches, which again, let's just be clear. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=518.0s)]
*  Your median convention speech is just not great oratory and, you know, eminently forgettable. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=522.0s)]
*  That's true of all parties and all the conventions I've been to. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=528.0s)]
*  But McKay, when am I looking here? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=530.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=532.0s)]
*  McKay, the question I have for you is so one thing that conventions can do very effectively. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=533.0s)]
*  And I think you saw this in 2020 with the Trump convention when he swore in the new immigrants in the White House is to play against type. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=542.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=549.0s)]
*  You're trying to get you're trying to get people to vote for you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=550.0s)]
*  You've got this big platform to vote for you that aren't already there. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=555.0s)]
*  You can play against type. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=558.0s)]
*  So George W. Bush, all the compassionate conservative stuff. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=559.0s)]
*  Donald Trump did a little of that in 2020. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=562.0s)]
*  I remember watching John Kerry in 2004 basically was going to like crawl through the mud to like kill Osama bin Laden himself. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=564.0s)]
*  Right. That was the stick there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=571.0s)]
*  Is there any of that happening atmospherically, thematically from what you're seeing there about sort of playing against type to folks that maybe are turned off by like the harder edges of magism? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=573.0s)]
*  I would say to Tim's point, if anything, they're they're going the other direction. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=585.0s)]
*  Right. Like that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=591.0s)]
*  I have not seen a lot of appeals to Mitt Romney Republicans, Nikki Haley Republicans, you know, Reaganism like that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=592.0s)]
*  That is so fully in the rearview mirror. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=600.0s)]
*  Now, I guess the caveat is that there are a lot of kind of speeches that are not broadcast in primetime that are just kind of very standard anodyne Republican talking points that like. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=602.0s)]
*  You've heard a thousand times. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=613.0s)]
*  Yeah. But for the most part, the big moments are not appealing to that that that left behind faction of the Republican Party. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=614.0s)]
*  They've got the teamsters on stage and I, you know, they're they're trying to appeal more to the kind of disenfranchised or frustrated parts of the Democratic coalition. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=623.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=634.0s)]
*  You know, I can say having spent some time in the last couple days texting with some of those old guard Republicans, they have not seen a single thing in this convention so far that makes them excited about Donald Trump. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=636.0s)]
*  If anything, they feel more alienated. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=648.0s)]
*  Hey there, MSNBC fans. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ru2WxIbA0&t=651.0s)]
