Tammy Duckworth joins Chris Hayes to discuss the Senate confirmation hearing of Trump’s Pentagon nominee Pete Hegseth. “He’s already told us that he’s willing to pay off somebody.

# 'You’re not qualified': Hegseth stumped by ‘101-level’ military questions
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI)
*  Senator Tammy Duckworth is a Democrat from Illinois who serves on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=0.0s)]
*  She's an Army veteran who received her Purple Heart for injuries in Iraq, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=5.5s)]
*  after a rocket-propelled grenade crashed her Black Hawk helicopter, and she joins me now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=9.0s)]
*  Senator, thank you for joining us on what is a very busy day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=14.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. Yes, it was a very busy day, a very insightful day, I think. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, let me ask you there. Did you learn something new? Did your mind change at all in anything? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=22.0s)]
*  What was your takeaway from the lengthy hearing today? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, my mind didn't change, and unfortunately it further solidified my opinion that Mr. Hec-Seth is not qualified to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=31.0s)]
*  He couldn't even answer some of my very basic questions about our alliances in the Indo-Pacific region. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=40.0s)]
*  And he, you know, made it clear that he'd never let an audit, for example, even though he says he wants to audit the Pentagon, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=46.0s)]
*  he had never, in fact, he'd never let an audit in any of the businesses that he ran before. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=53.0s)]
*  And in fact, he so badly mismanaged the finances of the not-for-profits he ran that they had to bring in a forensic accountant to figure out what audit he messed up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=58.0s)]
*  And now this man wants to run an $825 billion budget. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=67.0s)]
*  I want to play that exchange you had about, because I think if you're just looking at, does this guy have the resume? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=71.0s)]
*  Like, does he pass the resume test? If you were sorting resumes, you were sitting in an office, like you got an open position, you get a bunch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=78.0s)]
*  Like, no. Does he even make it into the we should interview him pile? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=85.0s)]
*  Here's the exchange you had about whether he'd ever let an audit. Take a listen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=90.0s)]
*  Yes or no, have you led an audit of any organization of which you were in charge? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=95.0s)]
*  Senator, in both of the organizations I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=100.0s)]
*  Yes or no, did you lead an audit? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=105.0s)]
*  Yes or no, did you lead an audit? Yes or no? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=107.0s)]
*  What are you afraid of? You can't answer this question. Yes or no, did you lead an audit? Do you not know this answer? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=109.0s)]
*  There was a lot of that today. I have to say even questions about a straightforward question about did you sexually assault the woman that accused you of sexual assault? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=116.0s)]
*  He said it's a smear, not a smear, but he wouldn't answer it, which was strange to me. You could just say no. You could say no, I've never led an audit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=125.0s)]
*  Like, it seemed like there was a lot of that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=132.0s)]
*  There was a lot of that. He was basically trying to tap dance his way through the hearing, and you know, at one point he was asked, if you were under oath, would your answer still be the same? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=135.0s)]
*  And he wouldn't even answer that. Look, here's what I'm afraid of. He's already had to pay off a woman who accused him of sexual assault in order to keep his last job at Fox News, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=146.0s)]
*  What is he going to be willing to do to pay off the next accuser who might show up after he becomes Secretary of Defense and has access to the nuclear codes and the location of U.S. troops around the world? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=158.0s)]
*  What happens when he wants to keep that job and somebody comes forward? He's already told us that he's willing to pay off somebody. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=168.0s)]
*  Does that mean that he is now who, and we're not going to have a Secretary of Defense who potentially is vulnerable to blackmail? Is that where we're headed with this nomination? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=174.0s)]
*  There is reporting about concerns about his drinking. He has denied that those concerns have any merit or basis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=184.0s)]
*  He has also said that he would quit drinking if he becomes Secretary of Defense. But I guess my takeaway from his answer today won't if he doesn't, which I think is a little strange. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=192.0s)]
*  And I wonder what you thought of that answer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=205.0s)]
*  Well, it's more of the same today. And in fact, the other part of the questioning today was if somebody was found to be drunk, passed out, had done any of these things, would they be qualified to be in command of a military unit? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=208.0s)]
*  And we're not even talking about him, and he would not answer that question either. Remember, this whole hearing, he kept talking about how he wanted to uphold the highest standards for women who want to serve in combat and for military men and women. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=222.0s)]
*  And yet throughout the entire hearing, he made it clear that he wanted us to lower the standards so that he could be Secretary of Defense. And I'm just not willing to do that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=235.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this almost as a devil's advocate question. There's part of me that thinks there's a kernel of truth here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=243.0s)]
*  The U.S. military is one of the most fearsome and sophisticated militaries in the history of human civilization. I think it's fair to say. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=249.0s)]
*  Does it matter who runs it? Like, maybe it just sort of runs by itself. And, you know, you've got a lot of very smart, very competent people with a lot of experience at the upper ranks and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in the services themselves. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=258.0s)]
*  And, you know, you could survive a guy who is a weekend news host who got the gig because he's buddies with the president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=273.0s)]
*  Well, but you can't. Ultimately, this is the Secretary of Defense. That's why I asked him the question about what is the highest level of international negotiation he has engaged in when it comes to a security agreement with a foreign nation? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=282.0s)]
*  Because that is actually conducted and led personally by the Secretary of Defense. And I asked him, name three. I mean, there's three main ones. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=299.0s)]
*  Name at least one of them a status of forces agreement, which would be one, for example. And he couldn't name a single one. This is basic 101 level stuff, and he couldn't name even a single one. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=307.0s)]
*  So he's coming to be asked to be confirmed. He hasn't even bothered to do his homework. So there are absolutely things that the Secretary of Defense must do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=318.0s)]
*  Donald Trump talks about wanting to invade Greenland and wanting to invade maybe the Panama Canal. If Donald Trump said to Hexseth, you know, on January 20th, I want you to prepare a plan to, you know, invade Greenland. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=326.0s)]
*  Could he lead that mission? My answer is no, he's not qualified. He wouldn't know what was a good mission and what was a bad mission. He wouldn't know who to put in the room to do to come up with the plans. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=340.0s)]
*  And, you know, more importantly, I think he personally is a compromised individual whom our adversaries are watching and digging the dirt on. And this makes him somebody who is vulnerable to our adversaries. And we don't need that person in charge of, as you say. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=351.0s)]
*  And I agree with you, the greatest military on the face of the earth. Yeah, I'm not quite sure who I'm rooting for, what I'm rooting for in the hypothetical you gave. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=367.0s)]
*  Maybe I am rooting for incompetence there, but there's other places where I would be rooting for more competence from Secretary of Defense, Senator Tammy Duckworth. Thank you very much for your time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=374.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-KeFVBxMI&t=382.0s)]
