# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ)
*  House Democrats forced their Republican colleagues to take action on Congressman George Santos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  after the scandal-plagued Republican was indicted on more than a dozen federal charges last [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=6.0s)]
*  week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=11.0s)]
*  Democrats used a fairly obscure provision in the House rolls to make the Republican-controlled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=12.0s)]
*  chamber take up the question of whether or not to expel Santos, called a privileged resolution. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=16.72s)]
*  Now, House Republicans really don't want to do that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=22.72s)]
*  They know, of course, Santos is a serial liar who has been accused of a litany of crimes, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=25.72s)]
*  grifts and schemes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=30.16s)]
*  They need his vote anyway. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=31.66s)]
*  So this afternoon, Kevin McCarthy's Republicans once again tried to just bury the whole thing, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=33.48s)]
*  sweep it under the rug. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=37.64s)]
*  Instead of an up or down vote on whether or not to expel Santos, Republicans voted instead [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=39.32s)]
*  along party lines to kick the issue over to the House Ethics Committee, which, get this, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=44.18s)]
*  is already investigating Santos. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=49.68s)]
*  To the vote, an ever-defiant Santos spoke to reporters outside Capitol Hill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=52.52s)]
*  I have not done my job since I've gotten here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  I can chew and walk gum at the same time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=60.24s)]
*  I can chew gum and walk at the same time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  I have not been convicted of any crime. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=64.56s)]
*  You insist on saying that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  I will have my day to defend myself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=68.68s)]
*  Congresswoman Becca Ballant is a Democrat of Vermont. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=73.2s)]
*  She's one of the co-sponsors of the resolution to expel George Santos, and she joins me now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=76.4s)]
*  Congresswoman, you succeeded in getting a privileged resolution taken up and dealt with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  on the floor. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=85.72s)]
*  Your reaction to the vote today? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=86.72s)]
*  It's incredibly disappointing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=88.32s)]
*  It is a dark day for America when you can't even get a serial liar, a fraudster, someone [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=91.0s)]
*  who pulled the wool over the eyes of all the voters in his district. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=98.96s)]
*  You can't even get that kind of person expelled from Congress. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=105.24s)]
*  This is a very sad day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=109.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've talked to a lot of members of Congress about George Santos. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  Robert Garcia is the president of the freshman class. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of New York congressmen who have a kind of, what the heck is this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=118.24s)]
*  dude doing in our state caucus feeling? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  What's your motivation here? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=125.2s)]
*  I imagine it doesn't matter one way or the other that your constituents in Vermont and, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=126.2s)]
*  you know, your voters, there's no huge political upside or downside here, but you seem pretty [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=130.6s)]
*  motivated. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=135.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=136.24s)]
*  I really appreciate that question. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=137.24s)]
*  I ran for this seat because of the actions of the Trump supporters on January 6th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=138.6s)]
*  I believe this is an inflection moment for our democracy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=145.56s)]
*  Democracies don't fail overnight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=150.0s)]
*  They fail little by little as norms are upended, as integrity is eroded. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=151.72s)]
*  And I feel very strongly that I have to be able to look my own kids in the eye when I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  come home to Vermont on the weekends when they ask me, how is it that a serial liar [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=161.68s)]
*  can continue to serve in Congress and be paid by the American people? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=167.72s)]
*  And I think about all of the students that I taught. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=173.28s)]
*  I was a history and civics teacher for a long time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=175.84s)]
*  And so my motivation is about protecting the democracy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=179.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  And actually, Vermonters care a whole lot about this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  I should note just some news today when you talk about, you know, him being a serial liar. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=186.32s)]
*  The vote today was partisan for the reasons we explained the intro, but the sentiment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=191.24s)]
*  is not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=195.12s)]
*  Republicans in his home county have called on him to resign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=196.28s)]
*  The five or six members of the Republican Party in New York have called on him to resign, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=199.4s)]
*  though crucially didn't vote for it today. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=203.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=205.56s)]
*  Which is notable. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=206.56s)]
*  It is notable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=207.56s)]
*  He also lost a staffer today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=208.56s)]
*  Nasa Wumer, who's the communications director, has resigned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=210.6s)]
*  She tells Scripps News, with respect for my colleagues, the people of New York, and most [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=215.08s)]
*  importantly myself, I am honored to tender my resignation, Wumer said in her resignation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=218.8s)]
*  email. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  She said the departure appearing to direct the comment towards Santos. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=224.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, you never took one point of professional advice given. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  I suppose that's not surprising. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=230.04s)]
*  Do you think we'll see more of that over time? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  Here's here's the thing that you have to understand is that there have been a series of votes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  that have been taken on the floor in the last few months. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=241.44s)]
*  And George Santos is at times applauded by his colleagues, especially if he's a deciding [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  vote. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=249.76s)]
*  They are certainly interested in protecting him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=250.76s)]
*  And that speaks to where this party is and where this conference is at this moment, when [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=254.68s)]
*  you have members of his conference standing up and applauding him when he takes a vote. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=259.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, voters back in New York do not feel like they are represented. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=266.72s)]
*  This is really an American issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=270.72s)]
*  Every voter should feel like they know who they're voting for. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=272.64s)]
*  And the person that they voted for was not, in fact, George Santos. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  It was somebody entirely different from that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=279.2s)]
*  And I just think that this is this is a an indication of a deep rot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=282.16s)]
*  And we as members of Congress need to do everything that we can to return some semblance of integrity [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=288.56s)]
*  to the body. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=294.88s)]
*  You're also calling for a censure of another one of your colleagues. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=296.8s)]
*  And I think your description about your motivation to run get shed some light on your motivation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=301.04s)]
*  here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=307.24s)]
*  You issued a letter calling on Representative Gosar, who we've covered on this program last [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=308.24s)]
*  few evenings, to be censured, saying his history of associating with and now hiring white nationalists [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  and neo-Nazis is deeply disturbing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=317.12s)]
*  The presence of proud neo-Nazis is a threat to people of color. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Jewish Americans who work here at the Capitol, as well as people we serve. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=321.88s)]
*  Speaker Mark Carthy must hold Rep. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Gosar accountable for this kind of overt neo-Nazi sympathizing that's pursuant, of course, to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=326.32s)]
*  Hunter Walker's reporting about this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=330.56s)]
*  We featured on the on the program. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=333.24s)]
*  Has there been any official response to this from anyone in Republican leadership or from [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=335.52s)]
*  Gosar's office? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  We haven't gotten any. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Not at this time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=343.08s)]
*  And I just want to be really clear, too. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=344.08s)]
*  I am the grandchild of somebody who was killed in the Holocaust. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=346.24s)]
*  My grandfather was killed in the last few weeks of the war on a forced march from the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=350.76s)]
*  concentration camp that he was a prisoner in in Austria. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=355.64s)]
*  This is very personal to me that I should not have to worry about walking these halls [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=359.98s)]
*  of Congress with with Nazis, about neo-Nazis serving in the offices of people who serve [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=366.62s)]
*  on committee with me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=373.44s)]
*  What has happened to this nation? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  House has overridden the governor's veto and the bill becomes law, notwithstanding the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  governor's objections. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=383.42s)]
*  So be notified. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=384.42s)]
*  That was a moment last night when North Carolina's Republican supermajority overrode the Democratic [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=385.42s)]
*  governor's veto and instituted a 12 week abortion ban, all abortions after 12 weeks after that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=398.74s)]
*  first trimester. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=404.66s)]
*  Starting in July, people in North Carolina will not have access to that abortion care. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  And despite the fact this is a devastating blow to abortion access both in the state [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  and across the South, Republicans are trying to brand this as a compromise. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=414.74s)]
*  There were certainly a lot on my side of the aisle who felt like a six week bill, like [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=420.02s)]
*  being debated in South Carolina and other states would be more appropriate. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=424.74s)]
*  And then of course there's some that wanted more weeks than 12. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=428.62s)]
*  And so the compromise came down to 12 weeks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=431.82s)]
*  There are so many extra restrictions packed onto this bill that make it really hard to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  get care before 12 weeks. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=440.58s)]
*  So I would really push back strongly against that narrative that this is any sort of compromise [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=442.9s)]
*  approach. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, listen, talk about compromise. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  They rolled back a right women had had in this country for 50 years. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=450.94s)]
*  That's the starting point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=454.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=455.62s)]
*  And banning abortion at 12 weeks isn't even popular in the state. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  A recent poll showed that 57% of North Carolina voters, 57% either support the state's current [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=460.26s)]
*  20 week ban or would expand it, meaning further out than 20 weeks. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=466.17999999999995s)]
*  Only 35%, just over a third of voters wanted to restrict access to 15 weeks or less and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=470.1s)]
*  they went lower than that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=475.86s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=478.22s)]
*  North Carolina is not a dyed in the wool red Republican state. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=480.1s)]
*  It's basically a 50 50 state. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=483.98s)]
*  They have a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=485.66s)]
*  They have a Democratic secretary of state and attorney general. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=487.38s)]
*  Donald Trump won the state in 2020 narrowly. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=490.22s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=493.42s)]
*  Less than 50% of the vote. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=494.42s)]
*  It's a pretty evenly state split state. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=495.42s)]
*  And yet and yet and yet through aggressive gerrymandering, Republicans have been able [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=498.96s)]
*  to secure a majority in both houses of legislature, even as they lost the governor's mansion twice [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  in a row. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=507.88s)]
*  But even that gerrymandering couldn't get them the super majority that they would need [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  to do things like Institute of veto proof abortion ban. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=513.56s)]
*  What allowed them to do that is one person, state representative Tricia Cawthon. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=518.04s)]
*  Last year, Cawthon ran to represent the 112th district as a Democrat. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=525.08s)]
*  She pledged during her campaign to oppose further restrictions on abortion. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  She was backed by Emily's List, which works to support women candidates who are pro abortion [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=535.36s)]
*  rights and she won that seat with 59% of the vote. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=540.76s)]
*  And then when she got to the legislature, she fulfilled her campaign promise by signing [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=545.12s)]
*  on as a co sponsor to a bill that would codify Roe v. Wade's abortion protections in the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=549.48s)]
*  state of North Carolina. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=555.48s)]
*  In fact, on the state houses website to this day, she is still listed on the bill as a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=557.04s)]
*  co sponsor. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=563.4s)]
*  But in April, just five months after she was elected as a Democrat who wanted to secure [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=565.64s)]
*  abortion rights out of the blue, Tricia Cawthon switched parties and that switch of parties. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=570.76s)]
*  It was that decision and her vote that then turned the Republican majority of North Carolina [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=577.36s)]
*  into a super majority. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  Here's her incredibly roundabout non explanation for why she took such a catastrophically consequential [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  step to become a Republican. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=594.16s)]
*  I have decided to change my party affiliation joining the Republican Party and have been [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=597.64s)]
*  welcomed with open arms by my colleagues. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=603.68s)]
*  This now where we are modern day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=608.0s)]
*  to so many others throughout this state and this country. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=615.88s)]
*  The party wants to villainize anyone who has free thoughts, free judgment, has solutions [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  who wants to get to work to better our state. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=629.72s)]
*  Did someone roast you really bad on Twitter and then you changed your party? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=633.96s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=637.96s)]
*  I mean, state Representative Cawthon never addressed why she changed, forget everything [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=639.96s)]
*  about the Democratic Party, let's say she's right about that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=644.76s)]
*  Why did she change her position on abortion? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=647.6600000000001s)]
*  Fine, you're a Republican now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=650.36s)]
*  Why did you change your abortion position so radically? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  What changed in five months from a Democrat who spoke movingly about her own abortion [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=658.92s)]
*  and reproductive rights, who supports codifying Roe v. Wade, who's a co-sponsor on legislation [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  listed on the state website to this day to a Republican who voted to override a congressional [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=670.8s)]
*  of governsorial veto for a 12 week abortion ban that only a third of voters want? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=682.16s)]
*  We got nothing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=683.8399999999999s)]
*  She owes that explanation to the people of her state, to the voters in the 112th district, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=686.56s)]
*  who sent a Democrat who wanted to protect Roe and abortion to the state house, a woman [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=691.4s)]
*  who just put a 12 week abortion ban on the books. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaNeu9IeQ&t=696.8s)]
