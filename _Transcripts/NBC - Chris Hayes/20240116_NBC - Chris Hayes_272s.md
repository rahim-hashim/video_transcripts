# Iowa voting in popcorn buckets exposes GOP ‘election integrity’ hypocrisy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY)
*  The Iowacauquises have this hold on the imagination of the nation's political reporting class. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because it's an open, frequently messy, experiment democracy, not to mention for TV networks, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=5.7s)]
*  you can actually point a camera at what's going on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=10.08s)]
*  After the Democratic Party's debacle of 2020, where there were delays in the count, the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=13.48s)]
*  top vote getter won fewer delegates, Democrats have just gotten rid of the whole thing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=17.44s)]
*  They're just going to have normal mail-in voting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=21.32s)]
*  Which honestly seems smart. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=23.66s)]
*  Not many people are up for joining the gaggle in this specific hour of the night, even when [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=25.8s)]
*  it isn't snowy and below freezing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=30.44s)]
*  But the Republicans have kept their caucuses, and there's a cheery civic informality to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=33.36s)]
*  it all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=37.84s)]
*  Even though it's not an official election run by the state, it's a party function. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  It's being run by the local Republican Party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=42.44s)]
*  There's something downright Rockwellian about the scene. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=45.84s)]
*  You've got people trudging out in the snow, and they all get in the room together, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=48.96s)]
*  they argue, and they consider the issues and the candidates. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=53.2s)]
*  And then they caucus like this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=56.08s)]
*  This is the voting method. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=58.68s)]
*  They are putting votes into a brown paper bag, passing it around, just stuff it in there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=60.2s)]
*  keep it moving. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=65.76s)]
*  Don't like grocery bags? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=66.76s)]
*  Hey, we prefer popcorn buckets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=68.36s)]
*  DeSantis. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=71.44s)]
*  Haley. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=74.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=77.92s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=82.44s)]
*  If that's not enough transparency for you, try this gathering, where they walk the aisles [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=83.44s)]
*  to grab ballots and stuff fistfuls of votes into clear, ziplock bags. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=88.12s)]
*  Can't get more transparent than plastic bags. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=93.36s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I don't personally have an issue with any of this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=95.4s)]
*  I do not think people are going to abuse the grocery bags and the popcorn buckets in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=98.2s)]
*  system. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=103.16s)]
*  But our friend, Elie Mestal, makes an interesting observation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=104.16s)]
*  He posts, this is what voting looks like when white people know only white people will be [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=107.88s)]
*  allowed to cast ballots. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=112.28s)]
*  Just grab them and count them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=114.88s)]
*  Just stuff them in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=116.6s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=117.84s)]
*  Pass it on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=118.84s)]
*  Watching this as the means of counting the votes and ballot security in the internal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=120.0s)]
*  world of Republican politics is really mind blowing when you think for a second about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=123.88s)]
*  the context here, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=129.48s)]
*  I mean, two thirds of caucus goers believe that Joe Biden is not the legitimately elected [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=131.44s)]
*  president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=136.96s)]
*  Four years of the big lie and the constant, disgustingly racist drumbeat about Democrats [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=138.92s)]
*  stealing the election. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=143.72s)]
*  Remember after the 2020 vote in Detroit when pro-Trump influencers passed around viral [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=145.92s)]
*  video of a wagon supposedly containing extra ballots being brought into the tabulation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=150.88s)]
*  room? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Who is actually a news photographer carting his equipment in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  But that didn't stop a white MAGA mob from pounding the glass and trying to force their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=159.92s)]
*  way in and chanting, stop the count. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=166.24s)]
*  A scene like that was replicated in places like Milwaukee and Philadelphia and Atlanta, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=169.12s)]
*  where Trump supporters launched personal attacks and threats against two black poll workers [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=174.72s)]
*  doing their civic duty. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=179.24s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Shea Freeman-Mars and one other gentleman quite obviously surreptitiously [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  What was your mom actually handing you on that video? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=193.18s)]
*  A ginger mint. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=196.62s)]
*  Remember how Democrats and volunteers of color could not be trusted to collect and count [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=199.22s)]
*  votes, that they were stealing, that they were part of a conspiracy? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Just keep that in mind as you watch this alternative universe in Iowa in which Republicans gather [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=207.5s)]
*  an incredibly homogenous population of folks and in this context, yeah, perfectly fine [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=212.82s)]
*  passing a paper bag around to stuff it with votes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=217.66s)]
*  Can you imagine what they would have done with that video if the bag were in the hands [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=222.14s)]
*  of Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss or poll workers in Detroit? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=227.42s)]
*  The point isn't about ballot security, it's not about the process that votes are counted, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=231.54s)]
*  it's not about mail-in balloting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  No, for Republicans, for Trump, to cry voting integrity is virtue signaling. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  It signals who they think should control elections and which people they think are really worthy [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=243.5s)]
*  of representation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qu9IskEgKY&t=249.82s)]
