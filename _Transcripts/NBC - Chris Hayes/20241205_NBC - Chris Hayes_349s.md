# UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: New evidence emerges on Day 2 of manhunt
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE)
*  A manhunt for the gunman who shot and killed United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson outside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=0.0s)]
*  a hotel in Midtown Manhattan continues. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=4.78s)]
*  Thompson was shot at least twice early yesterday morning by a man wearing a black jacket and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=7.54s)]
*  mask obscuring half his face. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=12.42s)]
*  Police still have not identified the suspect or a motive, but today the NYPD revealed that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=15.22s)]
*  the words deny, defend, and depose were discovered in scribe-nichele casings at the scene. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=19.94s)]
*  We'll talk about that in a moment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=26.5s)]
*  After the shooting, the suspect fled the scene on foot to a nearby E-bike. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=29.04s)]
*  He was last seen in Central Park after fleeing on that bike north of 6th Avenue into the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=34.96s)]
*  park. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=39.2s)]
*  Yesterday, police released the security camera photo showing the assailant at a nearby Starbucks [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=40.2s)]
*  before the shooting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Today we learned the gunman bought a water bottle and two protein bars from that nearby [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=46.8s)]
*  Starbucks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=50.42s)]
*  Investigators recovered a video showing where the gunman discarded the items and recovered [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  them as evidence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=55.86s)]
*  Also today, NYPD released two photos of a person of interest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=57.0s)]
*  Those pictures are from security footage recorded in an Upper West Side hostel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=61.4s)]
*  It's unclear what date these pictures are from, but you can see the full face there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=66.36s)]
*  Detectives have visited and searched one of the hostel's rooms. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=70.6s)]
*  Joining me now is NBC News correspondent Priscilla Thompson, who's been following the story. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=73.84s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=77.84s)]
*  What are the latest developments? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=78.84s)]
*  Yeah, so the latest thing that we're hearing about is how exactly this suspect may have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=80.2s)]
*  gotten into New York City. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  This idea that he took a Greyhound bus from Atlanta to New York on Sunday, November the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=86.72s)]
*  24th. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=92.4s)]
*  So a week and a half that he may have been in the city thinking about this, planning [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=93.4s)]
*  this, scoping things out, we don't know. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=97.56s)]
*  But what is clear is that the NYPD is finding the surveillance video and beginning to piece [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=99.32s)]
*  together a fuller picture of the hours, potentially the days leading up to this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=103.58s)]
*  NBC New York getting that surveillance video of the suspect on that E-bike on West 85th [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=108.6s)]
*  street when he was fleeing into Central Park, which is the last known place that police [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  know he was before we now no longer know his whereabouts, at least not publicly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=119.16s)]
*  And of course, the big video today, that surveillance video from the hostel where you actually see [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  the full face unmasked, that's been out there today across the TV screens and the newspapers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=128.7s)]
*  And so they're interviewing witnesses, people who may have spoken with him or seen him to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  try to piece together where he was and anything we can learn about him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=139.16s)]
*  So they are calling him so that they're calling it the suspect or assailant in the pictures [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=143.28s)]
*  in Starbucks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=148.84s)]
*  They're calling those images of that individual at the hostel a person of interest. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=149.84s)]
*  I think there's a technical legal reason they want to do that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=153.48s)]
*  But clearly they're interested in finding out who that person is and speaking to them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=156.16s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=161.44s)]
*  And so it seems from what we're looking at just as normal citizens that this is probably [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=162.44s)]
*  all the same person. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=167.58s)]
*  But police are being very specific about saying the man you see in that Starbucks video with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=168.8s)]
*  the face mask on, that is a suspect. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=172.96s)]
*  The person in the hostel video where you see the full face and he's smiling, we know they're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=175.68s)]
*  reviewing that footage of the person going down West 85th on the e-bike. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=179.86s)]
*  That is a person of interest who they are interested in speaking to in connection. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=183.72s)]
*  So we show that footage that's after he'd gone up into the park, gotten out of the park, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=188.08s)]
*  right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=193.72s)]
*  And then he's out of the park in West 85th, is that right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=194.72s)]
*  So it's my understanding that this is actually after he flees into the alley, he gets on [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  that e-bike and he's going down West 85th, going into the park. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=202.04s)]
*  And that's where they lose him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=205.72s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=207.28s)]
*  It's striking to me, there's some of the images we have, it is striking to me that that image [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=208.28s)]
*  of the person at the hostel where you have a full face, there's been several books written [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=215.76s)]
*  recently about facial recognition technology. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=221.04s)]
*  I had a Kashmir Kill who's a great reporter, wrote a book about it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=224.04s)]
*  I had her on my podcast, Why Is This Happening? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=226.68s)]
*  It's wild how powerful that is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=228.68s)]
*  I know in the January 6th investigation, for instance, it was used, you know, you could [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  sort of find everyone. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=235.08s)]
*  So it would seem to me that that's a pretty, like for modern facial recognition technology, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=236.08s)]
*  that feels like pretty close to what you would need to feed it into the database. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=241.36s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like a good photo. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  And undoubtedly, I'm sure the NYPD is running it through their databases now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=246.28s)]
*  Maybe they just haven't gotten a hit yet. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=250.68s)]
*  We don't know because they certainly haven't released a name publicly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=252.56s)]
*  And they also said with this Greyhound news that came out about him coming in by bus that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=255.52s)]
*  they're trying to see track that ticket to see if they can get any information about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=260.2s)]
*  who he was from that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=263.52s)]
*  So maybe they haven't gotten the ping on this face from the photos alone, but obviously [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=264.8s)]
*  working all the elements. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=269.92s)]
*  But they should have quite a database to be able to do that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=270.92s)]
*  We are anticipating that at some point there's going to be further developments in terms [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  of a name, right, or something closer. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=279.8s)]
*  But they have no they've given us no indication of if they have geolocated him in any area, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=282.12s)]
*  like whether he's got out of the city or whether he's got back to Atlanta. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=287.2s)]
*  Right. They don't know any of that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  Right. We know that they were kind of checking Port Authority earlier today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  But from what they have shared with the public, no sense of a geolocation where he might be, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  if he's even still in the city or not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=299.36s)]
*  And of course, the big thing, a name and that hostel where he was seen required ID and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=301.36s)]
*  payment. But they believe he used a fake ID there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=306.6s)]
*  And so it's interesting to see the places where he seemed really good at this very [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  professional, I guess, if you want to say about this and the places where you're finding [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  the water bottle, you're finding the protein bars. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=317.48s)]
*  We're going to continue to follow this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  I mind blowing to me that this is on the list right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=321.92s)]
*  Priscilla Thompson, thank you so much for your help. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  You bet. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujJ56ql4jE&t=328.20000000000005s)]
