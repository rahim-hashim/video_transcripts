# Judge from abortion pill case to hear $1.8B suit against Planned Parenthood
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk)
*  Today, South Carolina became the 21st state to have an abortion ban on the books after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican Governor Henry McMaster signed a six-week abortion ban to law, like the one [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=5.08s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Not only are conservatives trying to attack abortion access through state legislatures, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=11.42s)]
*  they're going through the courts as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=15.02s)]
*  An anonymous plaintiff backed by Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, the one that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=17.34s)]
*  we just talked about, just sued Planned Parenthood for $1.8 billion with a B. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=22.32s)]
*  You will never guess, in a millionaires, where this was filed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=29.56s)]
*  Which American city do you think they filed this anti-abortion lawsuit in? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=32.72s)]
*  You guessed it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=37.08s)]
*  Amarillo, Texas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=38.08s)]
*  Ding ding ding. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=39.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=40.08s)]
*  Amarillo's only federal judge, Matthew Kesmerick, the right-wing Trump-appointed judge who single-handedly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=41.08s)]
*  struck down the FDA's approval of Mephapristone, which had been safely on the market for over [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=45.64s)]
*  20 years, that is the judge that will hear this new case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=49.84s)]
*  Alexis McGill Johnson is CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=53.64s)]
*  Parenthood Federation of America, and she joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  It's good to have you in the program. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=62.08s)]
*  I have to say I saw the news of this lawsuit, and when I read some of the details, I'll [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=63.08s)]
*  give an example from a Vox explainer here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=68.52s)]
*  Basically, they're suing Planned Parenthood for complying with a federal court order. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=71.32s)]
*  That's the short version, the longer version. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  The Doe lawsuit alleges Planned Parenthood should have to repay all the money it received [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  for providing care to Medicaid patients in Texas and Louisiana during the period those [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=82.72s)]
*  two states were legally bound to keep working with them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=87.44s)]
*  They claim that Planned Parenthood is liable for three times the amount of money it received, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=90.52s)]
*  plus a penalty of up to $11,000 for each of the thousands of claims for payment filed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=94.08s)]
*  with those two states. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=98.8s)]
*  How serious is this lawsuit and does it pose a threat to your organization? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=101.12s)]
*  Well, Chris, yes, it's serious, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=106.52s)]
*  Because, yes, it is happening, you know, again, in a in a state and in a district that, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=108.88s)]
*  you know, we have seen has been hostile to reproductive freedom. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  So so are we concerned? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. Is is there any merit to the case? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=121.08s)]
*  Absolutely not. Exactly what you said, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=124.2s)]
*  These are baseless claims. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=127.0s)]
*  They're essentially suing for Planned Parenthood getting reimbursed for providing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  health care services in Texas to patients, just like every other health care provider [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  does. And so, you know, we follow the law to a T. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=138.4s)]
*  We ensure that we are compliant. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=143.24s)]
*  We are a nonprofit and millions of people depend on Planned Parenthood for their health [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=145.88s)]
*  care services. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=151.88s)]
*  But what is not clearly sufficient just to provide health care for some of these folks [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=153.56s)]
*  is that they are hell bent on trying to make sure that not only will they ban access to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=159.08s)]
*  abortion, not only will they ban access to gender affirming care, but they are hell bent on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=164.68s)]
*  also trying to shutter our doors. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=169.24s)]
*  And so we are fighting it every step of the way because it is completely baseless. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=171.2s)]
*  It is not true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=175.28s)]
*  And honestly, you know, it is a clear example of why we need court reform. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  There the case that also came out of the same district in Mexico, America and Amarillo, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=184.48s)]
*  met the pristone. This was a credible, audacious injunction nationwide that he'd ordered [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=190.72s)]
*  for that to be taken off the taken off the shelves. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=198.08s)]
*  Supreme Court ultimately stepping in and stopping that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=201.12s)]
*  But that case has now gone up to the appellate level in the Fifth Circuit in Texas, which [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=203.68s)]
*  is notoriously probably the most conservative. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=208.12s)]
*  And it seems like the conservative judges on that are pretty open to some of the arguments [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=211.36s)]
*  on met the pristone, like how ours Planned Parenthood gaming out the fact that this is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  likely going to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=220.52s)]
*  And the ability and viability of it on store shelves is not completely clear. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=221.8s)]
*  Well, look, we believe that met the pristone will be available for the foreseeable future. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=228.96s)]
*  But you were absolutely right. Again, that's why I ended my point on the need for court [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  reform when you can forum shop in district in in northern Texas in order to secure one [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=236.96s)]
*  judge who has, you know, indicated, you know, and clearly in his own opinion, indicated [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=243.52s)]
*  that he did not believe that the FDA had done proper due diligence on on met the pristone, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  which we know is safe and effective after 23 years and five million patients and being [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=255.08s)]
*  available in 60 countries, that it now goes to a conservative Trump appointed largely [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=259.56s)]
*  judges at the Fifth Circuit and then all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=264.68s)]
*  So our reproductive freedoms, not just in states like Texas and Nebraska and South [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=267.88s)]
*  Carolina, are under attack, but it is one case that could have implications for the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=272.6s)]
*  entire country. This court capture is the thing that is most threatening to to women [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  in this country. And that's where, you know, we that's the message that we need to get [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=283.0s)]
*  out. So people understand it's not just in the banned states, the 21 banned states [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=287.4s)]
*  nearly half the country. This is an attack that is coming to you, you know, right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=291.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it seems to me very clear, I think it was clear after Dobbs that they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=297.2s)]
*  going to keep doing everything they can until it's more it's banned everywhere all over [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=304.56s)]
*  the nation completely. I mean, is that your expectation of what the ultimate vision here [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=308.72s)]
*  is that you're working against? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that they were never real about returning the power to the states, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=316.72s)]
*  They came out during the leak time, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=321.48s)]
*  I think the day that the leak happened, they announced the opposition announced that they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=324.16s)]
*  wanted a nationwide ban. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=328.0s)]
*  Every Republican candidate is now being queried as a litmus test on where they stand on a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  nationwide ban. And we know that the fear of the nationwide ban is what is mobilizing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=335.4s)]
*  people. That is why you saw what you saw in in the midterm elections. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=341.0s)]
*  That's why you saw what you saw in Kansas right before that and in Wisconsin right after. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, we need to ensure that people both have access to care, but also [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  understand that every vote they take up and down the ballot is going to be vote related to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=356.4s)]
*  this care because you have folks who clearly need ethics reform, holding all of these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=361.04s)]
*  offices from attorney general to the to the state Supreme Court to lawmakers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=367.36s)]
*  And that's obviously incredibly concerning. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, one of those one of those fights happening in Ohio, we spotlighted yesterday in which [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=374.12s)]
*  they've now inserted a ballot amendment in August to raise the threshold to 60 percent [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=378.76s)]
*  to stop a majority of Ohioans who they suspect would vote for abortion rights from being [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  able to do that. So there's going to be a pre vote in August. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=390.96s)]
*  Just one of the many fights on this front. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Alexis McGill Johnson, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=395.44s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36OoJJFGbk&t=398.68s)]
