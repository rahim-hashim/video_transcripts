# ‘No, thanks’ GOP voters, major donors losing interest in the DeSantis ‘war on woke’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE)
*  Yes or no, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=0.0s)]
*  Whoever puts their hand on the Bible on January 20th every four years is the winner. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=6.4s)]
*  OK, but respectfully, you did not clearly answer that question. And if you can't give [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=11.88s)]
*  a yes or no on whether or not Trump lost, then how can you... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=17.04s)]
*  Of course he lost. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=21.0s)]
*  Trump lost the 2020 election? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=23.6s)]
*  Of course. Joe Biden's the president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=25.0s)]
*  Nearly three years after the 2020 election, Ron DeSantis has finally admitted that Donald [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=28.36s)]
*  Trump lost. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=32.28s)]
*  Sorta. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=33.28s)]
*  Now that the Florida governor's own presidential campaign is floundering and he's trailing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=34.28s)]
*  the indicted ex-president by double digits in every poll, DeSantis is willing to state [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=38.32s)]
*  the obvious. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=43.44s)]
*  But where does he get off saying, of course Joe Biden's the president, of course Donald [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=44.44s)]
*  Trump lost, as if that's what he's been saying all along, as if DeSantis has not spent the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=48.68s)]
*  years hedging and passive voicing his way out of stating that exact fact, all while [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=54.36s)]
*  pushing big lie adjacent conspiracy theories about election fraud and endorsing election [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=59.68s)]
*  denying candidates for office. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=64.76s)]
*  In fact, when it comes to managing elections, in many ways, DeSantis is almost more dangerous [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=66.92s)]
*  than Trump because while Trump lies about the election in a crazy way, DeSantis actually [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=72.26s)]
*  took steps as Florida's stunt governor to suppress legitimate voters under the guise [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=77.2s)]
*  of fighting imaginary voter fraud. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=82.0s)]
*  Remember back in 2021, DeSantis signed a so-called election integrity bill, which in reality [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  was a voter suppression law, making it harder for people to vote by mail and banning anyone [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=89.84s)]
*  except poll workers from distributing food or water to people waiting in line at the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=94.16s)]
*  polls. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=98.64s)]
*  Incidentally, NBC News does not have its own video of DeSantis signing that bill because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=99.64s)]
*  he blocked the ceremony to all media except his buddies at Fox, who aired it live as part [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=103.8s)]
*  of an exclusive interview. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=108.8s)]
*  And do not forget his tough guy press conference where he posed with law enforcement to brag [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=111.06s)]
*  about arresting a bunch of mostly black Floridians for alleged voter fraud. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=115.5s)]
*  The state of Florida has charged and is in the process of arresting 20 individuals across [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=121.5s)]
*  the state for voter fraud. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=128.12s)]
*  They did not get their rights restored, and yet they went ahead and voted anyways. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=133.82s)]
*  That is against the law, and now they're going to pay the price for it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=139.54s)]
*  We saw those arrests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  The alleged perpetrators were confused. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=145.66s)]
*  They had no idea what they were supposed to have done wrong. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=147.78s)]
*  And the police didn't have any answers either. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  Not long after that transparent PR stunt, many of those cases completely fell apart [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=152.1s)]
*  for a number of reasons following revelations that many of the folks DeSantis arrested under [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  the guise of voting illegally had actually been told by his own state government that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=161.42s)]
*  they were cleared to vote. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=166.94s)]
*  But if there is any small consolation here, it is that Ron DeSantis will almost certainly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  not be able to impose his extreme far-right agenda on America as a whole, if the polls [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  are to be believed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=178.77999999999997s)]
*  Because despite the governor's braggadocious promise in his pre-campaign book, which attempts [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=180.42s)]
*  to pitch his far-right agenda in the Sunshine State as a blueprint for the rest of the country, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=185.48s)]
*  it turns out most voters do not want to make America Florida. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=191.26s)]
*  Since DeSantis took office back in 2019, he has lurched Florida to the far right with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=196.46s)]
*  a series of political stunts, yes, stunts, designed explicitly to appeal to Republican [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=200.3s)]
*  presidential primary voters, like the aforementioned stunt with the fake voter fraud allegations, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=205.86s)]
*  or the time he callously shipped a bunch of migrants to Martha's Vineyard under false [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=211.06s)]
*  pretenses, a scheme that may still result in legal consequences. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=215.94s)]
*  But DeSantis' central governing ideology, such as it exists, has been his so-called [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=220.56s)]
*  war on woke. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=225.3s)]
*  There is seemingly no conservative culture war that the governor will not take the bait [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=227.06s)]
*  on, from the ridiculous backlash to Bud Light for sponsoring an Instagram post, from a transgender [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=230.74s)]
*  influencer to DeSantis' crusade against the 1619 project and teaching the truth to kids [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=235.94s)]
*  about institutionalized racism, to his costly and pointless fight with Disney after it criticized [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=242.34s)]
*  his so-called don't say gay law, which restricts discussions of LGBTQ issues in Florida's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  classrooms. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=253.82s)]
*  But here is the thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=254.82s)]
*  Voters just are not buying it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=257.18s)]
*  In a new article today, The New York Times analyzes recent polling data, which says that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=259.62s)]
*  even the Republican base just does not care about the anti-woke stuff. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=263.62s)]
*  Quote, when presented with the choice between two hypothetical Republican candidates, only [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=269.46s)]
*  24% of national Republican voters opted for a candidate who focuses on defeating radical [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=274.38s)]
*  woke ideology in our schools, media and culture over a candidate who prioritizes law enforcement [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=280.2s)]
*  and border security. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=286.36s)]
*  Among those 65 and older, often the most likely age bracket to vote, only 17% signed on to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  the anti-woke crusade. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=294.32s)]
*  Governor DeSantis has spent years picking these BS culture war fights, only to find [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=297.52s)]
*  that less than a quarter of the Republican base cares about any of it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, who never met a culture war he would not fight, even he understands [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=306.58s)]
*  the hyper-fixation on woke is a losing issue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=311.08s)]
*  The country has gone sick. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=316.26s)]
*  It's gone sick. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=318.18s)]
*  And I don't like the term woke because I hear woke, woke, woke. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=319.18s)]
*  You know, it's like just a term that used half the people can't even define it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=321.18s)]
*  They don't know what it is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=324.14s)]
*  DeSantis says he wants to make America Florida with all the culture war bigotry he's pushed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=325.94s)]
*  there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=330.74s)]
*  And so far America has responded, no thanks. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=331.74s)]
*  We'll have much more on the Florida governor's failure to launch and his remarkably terrible [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=335.26s)]
*  political instincts next. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS-Qfa6V7dE&t=339.5s)]
