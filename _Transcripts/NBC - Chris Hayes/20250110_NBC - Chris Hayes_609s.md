# Michael Cohen reacts to Trump sentencing, says he asked Biden for pardon
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk)
*  Now it's important to note that someone else did get convicted in connection with the very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=0.0s)]
*  crimes that Donald Trump was sentenced for today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=4.66s)]
*  Tony Michael Cohen, as Trump's former long-time lawyer and fixture, a guy who spent more than [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  a decade of his life by Donald Trump's side. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=12.36s)]
*  Back in 2018, you'll remember, he was prosecuted by the Justice Department under Donald Trump. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And he pled guilty and served time for facilitating the very illegal payments that Trump was, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=22.16s)]
*  quote unquote, sentenced for today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=26.72s)]
*  Michael Cohen is Donald Trump's former personal attorney. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=29.32s)]
*  He's also host of the Mea Culpa podcast and the host of the Michael Cohen show on YouTube. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=31.44s)]
*  You can find all those where you get your podcasts and your YouTube. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=37.96s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=40.6s)]
*  Well, Michael, I thought of you today because you did, you know, you pled to in federal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=42.2s)]
*  court the very, you know, facilitating the very things that the former president and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=47.64s)]
*  incoming president was convicted for for jury of his peers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=54.32s)]
*  It was part of the sentence to which you agreed that you had to serve. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=58.08s)]
*  Donald Trump was afforded these extraordinary protections, as the judge said, because he [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=62.04s)]
*  was elected president. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=65.36s)]
*  How are you feeling about it? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=66.36s)]
*  Look, I'm obviously very torn between what I would have liked to have seen happen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=68.36s)]
*  Don't forget, I received a six year sentence, three years of incarceration, three years [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  of supervised release in my entire legal career. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=80.24s)]
*  I've never even heard of an unconditional discharge. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=83.84s)]
*  I was so confused about it, I actually went to chat GPT despite the fact that Judge Furman [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=86.92s)]
*  doesn't think anybody should go through chat GPT. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=95.52s)]
*  And I looked it up and I was unable to find anybody in history who has ever gotten an [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=96.52s)]
*  unconditional discharge. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=102.24s)]
*  Now I think that Judge Mershon was judicious in his decision and he was also I think the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=104.36s)]
*  decision was appropriate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  I will turn around and say, however, that where I hate to say this, I agree with Todd [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=113.64s)]
*  Blanch and I agree with Donald Trump in this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  If there's no accountability and there's no deterrence factor because there is no repercussion [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=122.0s)]
*  for the 34 criminal counts, I don't see the point in having the conviction. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=128.68s)]
*  They probably could have and should have just dismissed the case all in and of itself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=134.56s)]
*  And I know a lot of people are saying, well, it doesn't make sense. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=140.22s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=142.82s)]
*  You know, I don't take solace in the fact that Donald Trump is becoming the very first [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=144.18s)]
*  president or former president of the United States to become a convicted felon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if it makes people happy so that they can now call him the felon president, OK, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=154.34s)]
*  that's on them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=160.62s)]
*  You know, I still have a lot of respect for the office of the presidency. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=161.62s)]
*  And I am a firm believer that to commit a crime and have absolutely no punishment, no [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=165.76s)]
*  accountability, no deterrence factor, I just don't see the purpose. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting you say that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=176.56s)]
*  I hear what you're saying fully. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=179.6s)]
*  It's also I mean, when you talk about the unconditional discharge, part of this is so [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=182.36s)]
*  crazy is, you know, again, you're a felon officially, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=184.78s)]
*  Like you know that label. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=190.18s)]
*  You know that label applies to all kinds of people who've been who've done all kinds of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=191.18s)]
*  stuff, including genuinely horrible things and things that they were in the wrong place [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=194.62s)]
*  at the wrong time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=199.58s)]
*  Or they you know, they made a mistake under the influence of a bad addiction. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I know people that are convicted felons who are amazing people have rebuilt their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=208.3s)]
*  And part of what's so crazy about watching all this is like we're in a country that put [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=209.3s)]
*  so many people in prison, so many people end up doing bids young with real trauma and substance [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=213.5s)]
*  And not a lot of like mercy and forgiveness from the court, not a lot of like, well, there's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=225.86s)]
*  special circumstances. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  So it's it's a little tough to swallow in the context of one of the most incarcerated [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  countries on the planet. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we are known for human warehousing, which I like to call it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=239.94000000000003s)]
*  You know, the thing I take somewhat offense to was really Trump's allocution to some respect [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=246.74s)]
*  where he's saying that I was allowed to speak like George Washington, but I am not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=251.86s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=256.54s)]
*  Truthfully, I don't understand what he meant by it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=257.54s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=260.74s)]
*  But when he also turns around and starts talking about how he's unfairly treated and this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=262.62s)]
*  is lawfare, the weaponization of the Department of Justice, it was actually his attorney general [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=269.14s)]
*  who was probably the most guilty of weaponization of the Justice Department. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=275.14s)]
*  I was unconstitutionally remanded back to Otisville thanks to Alvin K. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  Hellerstein removed from it because I refused to waive my First Amendment constitutional [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=287.98s)]
*  right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=293.38s)]
*  And I would love to know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=294.38s)]
*  I still after four plus years have not been successful in getting any of my documents [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=295.38s)]
*  of the four hundred and eighty six thousand documents that exist in order to turn around [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=300.38s)]
*  and to demonstrate how Bill Barr was involved and created this whole concept, as far as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=306.02s)]
*  I'm concerned, of lawfare. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=311.62s)]
*  So Donald is wrong when he says that this is the first time ever that this is happening. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=313.5s)]
*  And of course, he's the the martyr for the entire issue. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=318.26s)]
*  He is not. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=321.62s)]
*  I'm first. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=322.62s)]
*  Let me just play briefly a little bit of what he had said, which I also was so confused [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  by. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  I was asking the producers beforehand to get the context. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  But here's what he had to say briefly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=331.94s)]
*  And this is a man who's got no standing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=335.7s)]
*  He's been disbarred on other matters unrelated. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=339.42s)]
*  And he was allowed to talk as though he were George Washington. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=344.78s)]
*  But he's not George Washington. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=348.9s)]
*  He shouldn't have been allowed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=349.9s)]
*  I will say he you are not George Washington. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=352.5s)]
*  That is a true statement. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=354.86s)]
*  But it is clear. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=356.9s)]
*  I will turn around and say that my hair my hair has definitely got my hair has definitely [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=357.9s)]
*  gotten gray like George Washington's as a result of this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=360.78s)]
*  But no, I am not George Washington. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=364.18s)]
*  Here's one thing that does stick out to me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  And I'm curious to hear what you think about this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=367.9s)]
*  I mean, he's still pretty focused on you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=370.62s)]
*  You know, there's all this talk about an enemy's list. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  There's talk about lawfare. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=375.02s)]
*  There's you know, there's evidence that William Barr, I think there's good evidence that the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=376.02s)]
*  Department of Justice did was essentially weaponized against you specifically, you know, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=379.18s)]
*  from Trump down to Barr. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  Certainly circumstantial evidence. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  And we don't have the hard evidence. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  But it appears that that is a likely scenario. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  They're now promising. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=391.26s)]
*  Well, I think there's more. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=392.42s)]
*  Wait, Chris, Chris, I want to correct you on something. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=393.42s)]
*  I think that it's not it's not that type of evidence, circumstantial evidence. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=395.82s)]
*  It's factual. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=400.94s)]
*  They gave to me a document that does not exist in the system. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=402.06s)]
*  It was a counterfeit document that they created for me. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=406.5s)]
*  I've actually posted it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=410.34s)]
*  I've given it to MSNBC. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=411.58s)]
*  It's a counterfeit document that required me to waive my First Amendment constitutional [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  right and not publish my first book disloyal when I refused to do it and asked them to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=418.9s)]
*  tamp down the First Amendment constitutional violating language. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=424.26s)]
*  They had the marshals there who handcuffed shackled me and put me back into solitary [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=429.02s)]
*  confinement, making it a total of 51 days. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=433.78s)]
*  So yeah, I believe that accountability should be had, whether it's, you know, they turn [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=437.58s)]
*  around, they make Trump in a conditional discharge, make him go in even just sort of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  serve soup at a soup kitchen or food to the homeless or to the impoverished, make [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  there some form of accountability. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=454.1s)]
*  But that's not what's going to happen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=458.94s)]
*  So there's already a record here, right, that of using the Justice Department and having [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFpNcFEaJk&t=459.7s)]
