# 'I feel like a drug dealer': Trump allies charged in Wisconsin over 2020 plot
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk)
*  It has been nearly three and a half years since the attempted coup of January 6, 2021, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=0.0s)]
*  yet there are still charges coming in nearly every week, it seems, against the people involved, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=3.84s)]
*  both sort of on the ground and in the offices, as it were. Today, it's in Wisconsin where State [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=8.96s)]
*  Attorney General Josh Call announced felony charges of forgery against three men involved [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=14.72s)]
*  in the attempt to submit fake elector votes in 2020. Mike Roman was Trump's campaign head of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=20.32s)]
*  election day operations. James Troupis is a former judge and Trump campaign attorney, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=25.92s)]
*  and Ken Chesbrough, a name you may already be familiar with, is one of the masterminds [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=31.68s)]
*  behind the fake elector's ploy. Chesbrough has already pleaded guilty in the election [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=36.08s)]
*  interference case in Fulton County, Georgia. He is cooperating in Arizona's fake elector's case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=41.2s)]
*  Mike Roman was also charged in Fulton County and Arizona. This is the first time James [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=46.72s)]
*  Troupis has been charged. He now joins dozens of other lesser-known defendants facing charges in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=51.76s)]
*  the multiple fake elector schemes in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. Now, of course, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=57.04s)]
*  the reason those were happening in all those different states was one man who was behind it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=65.2s)]
*  all, who was trying to stay in power against the will of the people, and has only been listed as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=68.96s)]
*  an unindicted co-conspirator in Michigan and Arizona. He is, of course, facing charges in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=73.44s)]
*  Fulton County, Georgia, and federal election interference charges. Currently, he's being [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=78.64s)]
*  essentially bailed out by the Supreme Court that seems intent on delaying the federal trial [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=84.4s)]
*  until after voters go to the polls in November. Joined now by MSNBC legal correspondent and former [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=89.36s)]
*  litigator Lisa Rubin. Lisa, good to have you here. Tell me about these charges brought by the attorney [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=94.48s)]
*  general of Wisconsin today. So the attorney general of Wisconsin has done something a little bit more [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=99.44s)]
*  surgical than we've seen in other states, only charging three individuals. You mentioned them [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=103.84s)]
*  by name, Ken Chesbrough, Mike Roman, and Jim Trupus. But Wisconsin is the original sin in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=108.24s)]
*  some ways because Trupus and Chesbrough were both people who were licensed to practice in Wisconsin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=115.36s)]
*  They knew one another. In mid-November is when Trupus and Chesbrough first get together, and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=120.96s)]
*  Chesbrough says to Trupus, hey, I have this idea. And he writes the memo and shares it with Trupus. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=126.64s)]
*  That's when Trupus says, hey, I think this has some traction. I'd like to float this with people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=131.76s)]
*  in the national operation. And then sooner than he knows it, Ken Chesbrough is enmeshed in very [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=135.44s)]
*  heady conversations with people who are then at the center of power and gravity in Trump world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  People like Rudy Giuliani or people like Boris Epstein. So one of the things that I think is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=146.4s)]
*  important for people to know is Wisconsin is where this fake electors scheme was launched. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=152.48s)]
*  But it also has particular resonance because Ken Chesbrough actually attended the fake electors [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=158.0s)]
*  meeting in Wisconsin. He went along for the ride. He took pictures of himself. There's video of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=163.68s)]
*  him there. And then finally, his final act before going to January 6th and sort of tagging along [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=168.64s)]
*  with Alex Jones was to deliver the fake electors certificate from Wisconsin to take it from a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=174.16s)]
*  Republican Party of Wisconsin part-time staffer and then give them to another staffer on the hill [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=180.48s)]
*  who was going to ensure that they got into the hands of Mike Pence's legislative liaison on the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=188.0s)]
*  floor of the Senate. It was like, who can we trust? It was like a handoff. You'll remember that this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=192.96s)]
*  they tried to recruit Ron Johnson, right? Correct. And the Republican Party staffer who was involved [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  in this handoff, you know, was sort of so nervous about the whole thing that she infamously texted, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=201.28s)]
*  I feel like a drug dealer. So I think one of the things that's important for people to understand [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  is Ken Chesbrough. She's talking about the drop. She's talking about the drop. And she says, I feel like a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=209.36s)]
*  drug dealer because, and I just want to stay on that for a second because that stuck out to me so [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  much. We've seen that before. John Bolton described Rudy Giuliani's shenanigans and his off-book [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=216.88s)]
*  operation that was the subject of the first impeachment as I don't want to be involved in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=222.16s)]
*  whatever Rudy's drug deal is. And what that term is, is I know there's something illicit happening [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=226.0s)]
*  here. That is a way of, so when you have someone saying this feels like a drug deal, it's like, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=233.6s)]
*  right, you understand that this is not on the level. No, this is not on the level. And in fact, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=237.68s)]
*  you know, one of the things that's also distinguishable here is that the 10 fake [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  electors in Wisconsin prior to the bringing of this indictment were subject to a civil litigation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=246.8s)]
*  brought by a number of people, including our friend and colleague, Mary McCord, through [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=251.76s)]
*  Georgetown University. When they settled that litigation, they not only admitted wrongdoing, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=255.28s)]
*  but essentially said, Biden is the lawfully elected president. We were told that we needed to do this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=260.56s)]
*  in order to preserve the campaign's rights should it prevail in litigation. And we were tricked [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=267.2s)]
*  because we didn't understand that by signing this, they were going to continue the scheme irrespective [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=272.88s)]
*  of whether they won or lost the litigation. And if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if we actually [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=277.84s)]
*  have the document itself as an element, but there's a, Chesbrough himself in one of the documents [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=283.28s)]
*  uses the term weaponized to describe how he wants to marshal the Electoral Count Act, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=291.44s)]
*  which is the federal law that guides this whole process. We're basically going to weaponize the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=296.64s)]
*  Electoral Count Act. And I think it's important when exactly he says this in the scheme of events [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=300.4s)]
*  too, because on December 16th of 2020, through their friend and fellow Wisconsinite, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=305.28s)]
*  Grant's Priebus, who becomes Trump's first White House chief of staff, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=310.55999999999995s)]
*  Jim Trubas and Chesbrough go to the White House to meet with Trump. The substance of their conversation [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  isn't discussed here, but in other reporting, they basically went to talk to him about what the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=320.32s)]
*  prospects could be going ahead. And they were warned by Priebus, don't get him overly excited. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=325.84s)]
*  And of course that's exactly what Ken Chesbrough did. So the next day Chesbrough is trying to kind [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=330.56s)]
*  of be a more moderating force and says, well, look, things would have been better if we had won [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=335.92s)]
*  litigation, particularly in Wisconsin and other courts, but we still have a chance if we can [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=341.6s)]
*  weaponize the Electoral Count Act and sort of use it as a cudgel to show that these Democrats are [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=346.96s)]
*  relying on a clearly unconstitutional law to circumscribe the rights of people to debate this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=352.32s)]
*  in the Senate. Those pictures we've been showing us, V-roll with his Chesbrough, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=357.36s)]
*  they're taking the pictures of the fake Elector ceremony. With his mask on. With his mask on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=360.88s)]
*  When I saw that, there he is right now. I thought of like the Hollywood trope of like the arsonist [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=366.16s)]
*  that comes to watch the fire. It's like, there he is, taking it all in, taking it in his hand. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=370.48s)]
*  You work, Lisa Rubin. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7jiYfAniPk&t=375.28000000000003s)]
