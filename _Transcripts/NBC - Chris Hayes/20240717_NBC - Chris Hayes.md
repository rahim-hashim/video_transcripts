# Dem senator Kelly reacts to secret Schumer-Biden meeting
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw)
*  And Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona joins us now. Senator Kelly, I just want to first get [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=0.0s)]
*  your reaction as you are in the Senate. And we are hearing some reports from ABC News, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  to some degree confirmed by our sources with NBC News, that Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=10.16s)]
*  had a one-on-one conversation with President Biden in Delaware on Saturday, where he, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=16.16s)]
*  it appears it sounds like, took the concerns of his caucus to the president and suggested he [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=23.12s)]
*  needed to step down. What is your reaction to that? Well, I just heard that today, and we've had [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=28.56s)]
*  meetings with Senator Schumer over the last couple weeks, you know, talking about this issue. But [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=35.04s)]
*  I think the reality of the situation is that President Biden and Kamala Harris are our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=40.32s)]
*  nominees. Millions of Americans voted for them across the country and, you know, 50 states and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=45.92s)]
*  territories. And we have an election in 110 days, and we've got to be focused on that. We've got to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=51.84s)]
*  make sure that we work as hard as possible, not make any mistakes here. And if we do that, I'm [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=58.24s)]
*  confident that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can be re-elected. Do you think that's the view of your [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=63.68s)]
*  fellow Democrats in the Senate as well? Well, I'm not going to get into, you know, our internal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=69.44s)]
*  discussions, and I'm not going to speak, you know, for my colleagues. I will say that there [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=74.8s)]
*  are differing views. Let me ask you this, Senator. We were just discussing, of course, the assassination [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=79.28s)]
*  attempt, which just happened a few days ago in Butler, Pennsylvania. Obviously, your wife, Gabby [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=85.68s)]
*  Giffords, was shot and previously wounded when serving as a United States congressperson. You [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=91.04s)]
*  know firsthand the effects of both gun violence and political violence, what it does, even just [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  at the human level. I am curious to hear how you've reacted to this news, how it landed in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  your household when it's so close. Well, certainly for me, it brought back, you know, memories from, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=111.68s)]
*  you know, those days, you know, the day that Gabby was shot. As you said, she was serving in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  Congress. She was meeting with her constituents. She was a member of Congress. At the time, I was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  an astronaut. I'd flown a few space shuttle missions. I flew 39 missions in combat. But as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  it would turn out, my wife, Gabby Giffords, was the person who had the dangerous job. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=135.36s)]
*  And it's sad to think that this continues. I mean, that was 13 years ago. And today we still have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=141.52s)]
*  this kind of political violence. I really feel for the president, former president and his family, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  certainly for the family members of the firefighter that was killed that day. There is no place [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  in our society for this kind of violence. Do you, Senator, sorry, it's Alex Wagner again. Do you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  have a sort of an assessment of how the Republican Party has grappled with the attempted assassination [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  of its ticket leader? Do you, have you gotten anything, I think, as someone who's experienced [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  it yourself and has feelings about it and has processed it? I mean, what do you make of how [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=177.12s)]
*  the GOP is grappling with it on whole? Well, I mean, having experienced this myself, I know [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=182.0s)]
*  it's got to be shocking for them. I mean, to think that this could happen. And I'm thankful [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  that the shooter was not successful. You know, the former president got, was extremely lucky here [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=193.84s)]
*  and was only slightly injured. But we have an election coming up and we've got to tone down [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=200.72s)]
*  the rhetoric. I was on Capitol Hill on January 6th. And when the former president through [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  political speech sent a mob up there to interfere with the peaceful transition of power, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=215.44s)]
*  and, you know, that shouldn't be something that's tolerated in our society. And I'm concerned, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=222.88s)]
*  if this continues, that we could have somebody, additional people injured or killed. So I think [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=230.72s)]
*  it's on all of us to try to tone down the rhetoric, to focus on the election, which is a very [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  patriotic thing that happens every two or four years in our country. And we've got to resolve [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=242.0s)]
*  our differences at the ballot box. One thing that really concerns me, Alex, is that with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=248.4s)]
*  selection of JD Vance, you have somebody that is only in that position as the vice presidential [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  candidate because of his loyalty, his loyalty to Donald Trump, and that he would do what Mike Pence [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=260.64s)]
*  refused to do, which is to change the outcome of the election. And then you add on top of that his, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, his issues that he has with women reproductive rights, which I'd be happy to get [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  into you in more detail. I'm really concerned that JD Vance could be a heartbeat away from the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=279.2s)]
*  presidency. Senator, I'm glad you brought up JD Vance. JD Vance was one of two Senate candidates [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=286.64s)]
*  in the last cycle that were heavily backed by right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel. There's kind [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=293.36s)]
*  of a group of people, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, David Sacks, and others, just kind of very right-wing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=298.32s)]
*  tech billionaires. Chris, the other one was my opponent. That's exactly what I was going to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=305.28s)]
*  ask you. You learned something because you got millions of dollars dropped on your head on behalf [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=309.92s)]
*  of Blake Masters, who you defeated. And I'm curious what you learned from that race. Well, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=313.84s)]
*  they're very similar. I mean, I know these guys. I mean, JD Vance wants a total abortion ban. I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=318.08s)]
*  mean, total abortion ban. And when asked about exceptions for rape and interest and incest, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=323.68s)]
*  I mean, what do they say? He said, two wrongs don't make a right. I mean, when is it wrong for a woman [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=330.32s)]
*  who has been raped to want to terminate a pregnancy? You know, and he said that these were [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=335.92s)]
*  just inconveniences, that the fact that a woman could be pregnant after being raped. I mean, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  an inconvenience is when you get stuck in traffic on your way home from work. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=349.36s)]
*  You know, I have two daughters. I have a granddaughter. I'm really concerned about [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  JD Vance being a heartbeat away from the presidency and also just as vice president, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  being involved in decision-making that can affect my kids. I mean, this guy voted against protections [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=363.36s)]
*  for birth control and IVF. And I mean, he's also, when he talks about Social Security and Medicare, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=370.16s)]
*  talks about how this is a roadblock. I mean, those programs are lifelines for millions of seniors [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=378.4s)]
*  across our country. Senator, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you envision [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=385.28s)]
*  in terms of MAGA 2.0 if JD Vance is the vice president. I mean, he comes from, or he is rooted [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=390.56s)]
*  in a form of conservatism that almost makes MAGA look moderate in some ways. Well, I think with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=396.32s)]
*  anything, 2.0 is usually worse than 1.0. So, I mean, I would expect this thing to eventually [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=403.2s)]
*  will go off the rails. But I think what the American people need to recognize is, you know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=409.76s)]
*  that their freedoms and their rights are at stake here. In this election, on November 5th, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, we've got to get our voters out showing up to make sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=422.0s)]
*  are reelected. I am really concerned about our future with four more years of Donald Trump in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=428.0s)]
*  the White House. And then what could come after that with possibly with JD Vance? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=433.76s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly, thank you for making the time tonight. Really, really appreciate it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQcpJQ8C3Qw&t=439.04s)]
