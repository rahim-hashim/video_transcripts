# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 15
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Alicia Menendez in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=0.0s)]
*  While star witness Michael Cohen testified against Donald Trump at his New York trial yesterday, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  the former president was joined by quite the entourage of defenders. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=8.56s)]
*  Now, according to reporting from Rolling Stone, quote, in the early days of the trial, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=12.48s)]
*  the former president was infuriated by the lack of visible support from his allies at the courthouse. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=16.32s)]
*  Where are they, he complained earlier this month. Well, Trump's allies, they now appear to have [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=21.92s)]
*  heard those complaints loud and clear. They showed up in full force in downtown Manhattan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=27.52s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump received visible support from multiple members of his family, his son, Eric, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=32.64s)]
*  along with daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Laura, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=37.44s)]
*  as well as a who's who of Republican politicians. The surrogates included former Republican [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=41.28s)]
*  presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Congressman Cory Mills and Byron [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=46.96s)]
*  Donalds, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and even speaker of the house, Mike Johnson. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=51.92s)]
*  Trump's entourage was united in their message as they all spoke to the cameras. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=57.84s)]
*  All of us are here as friends of Donald Trump, supporting him in our personal capacity. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=63.44s)]
*  President Trump is innocent of these charges. The American people have already acquitted [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=68.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. The judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=73.44s)]
*  This this trial is a joke. This thing is a farce. There's no crime here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=78.0s)]
*  Where's the crime? There is no crime. It's so corrupt and everybody knows it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=82.8s)]
*  The Trump surrogates also use their time at the microphone to level more personal attacks [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=87.28s)]
*  against Michael Cohen, a witness, even Judge Juan Marchand's family. Of course, they were saying [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=91.52s)]
*  what Trump himself cannot because he is currently under a gag order. I'm going to talk more about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=96.56s)]
*  that later in the show. But the other clear intention of the Trump gang was to bring the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=101.28s)]
*  campaign to the courthouse. Several of the surrogates were obviously auditioning for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=105.36s)]
*  vice president with Ramoswami, Donald's and Burgum, all reportedly under consideration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=109.76s)]
*  The entire group in coordinating outfits, a dark suit and a red tie, even recorded a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=115.52s)]
*  fundraising plea for Trump's campaign led by Laura Trump and posted to her social media account. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=121.28s)]
*  We're here in court with President Trump standing with them, but we need you to stand with them too. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=127.52s)]
*  Go to DonaldJTrump.com, support President Trump and his efforts to win this election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=131.68s)]
*  These Democrats are nuts and they must be defeated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Anything you can give would make a world of difference. We are here fighting the good fight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  They cannot win. We need your help to make America great again. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's make America great again. And he's the man to do it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=147.68s)]
*  So while Trump's entourage may have provided some moral support, politics was clearly their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=154.08s)]
*  main purpose. I'm joined now by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. Congressman, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=159.44s)]
*  first, your impression of the political support you saw for the former president this week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=164.8s)]
*  Well, you know, they're all attracted to the Mecca of the courthouse in order to demonstrate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=171.44s)]
*  their complete obeisance and sycophancy to Donald Trump. And I think it's a good thing that they are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=176.48s)]
*  identifying themselves, the people who have completely allowed Donald Trump to devour their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=185.28s)]
*  critical thinking skills and their political and moral independence. I mean, Speaker Johnson is a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=190.72s)]
*  guy who has said that the Bible is his guiding document and is basically the law of the land. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=196.16s)]
*  And yet he's made the pilgrimage to New York to demonstrate, you know, what, how obsequious he [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  can be to Donald Trump, a guy who is now an adjudicated rapist, an adjudicated fraudster in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=209.76s)]
*  New York. And he's on trial for cooking the books for lots of money in order to cover up [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  hush money payments to his porn star mistress. So, you know, I'm a member of the Free Thought Caucus [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  and we've been saying all along that Speaker Johnson's adherence to religion is just a form [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=233.68s)]
*  of political tribalism. It doesn't have anything to do with religious principle. And now he's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=240.24s)]
*  showing the whole world that that's true. Especially interesting, since he is not on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  that list, what I would call a long list, not a short list of potential VP picks. How is the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=248.8s)]
*  fact that you have all of these sitting members of Congress traveling to New York to do Donald [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=254.56s)]
*  Trump's political bidding impacting the workflow of the U.S. House of Representatives? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=259.84s)]
*  Well, I know that they have to move one farce, which is the scheduled hearing and markup session [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=266.88s)]
*  about holding Attorney General Garland in contempt for actually complying with their order and turning [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=275.12s)]
*  over the complete transcript of Donald Trump's interview with special counsel Herr. Now they've [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  decided that's not enough. They don't just want the verbatim transcript. They want the audio tape. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=288.48s)]
*  And in order to salvage their completely discredited and humiliating impeachment voyage, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=293.68s)]
*  they're trying to hold Merrick Garland in contempt. Well, that was scheduled for 11 a.m. tomorrow. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  And we just got notice it's been moved to 8 p.m. because a bunch of members of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=305.36s)]
*  majority in the Oversight Committee are traveling to New York so they can soothe [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=309.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's wounded feelings that nobody was there to support him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=314.88s)]
*  As you said, one farce crowding out the other. So all of this, right? They're standing in front [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=318.32s)]
*  of the courtroom. They're doing fundraising appeals from inside the courthouse, all in the service [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  of a second Trump term. When we talk about the potential dangers of that possibility, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=327.52s)]
*  there was reporting in the Washington Post about a Mar-a-Lago dinner where the former president, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=332.32s)]
*  he promised to ease regulations on the oil industry while asking executives to steer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  $1 billion to his campaign. You have now opened an investigation into that dinner. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  Which details are you hoping to gather and how do you establish that as a quid pro quo? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=345.68s)]
*  Well, it's just amazing how explicit all of this is. He's basically saying to the oil and gas execs, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  pony up a billion dollars, which will go in some part to his campaign, but mostly probably to his [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=360.4s)]
*  lawyers and his legal expenses and who knows how much of it makes its way back to the Trump family. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=366.64s)]
*  But in any event, he's saying, give me a billion dollars and I'm going to reverse the Biden [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=372.32s)]
*  administration's actions on liquefied natural gas. I'm going to blow the roof off the house in terms [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=378.56s)]
*  of allowing you to drill wherever you want to drill and so on. And everybody knows where Donald [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=386.96s)]
*  Trump stands, but it's almost as if he wants to walk right up to the line of criminal bribery and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=392.72s)]
*  state what the quid pro quo is. Obviously there can be no criminal or civil action before [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  the election. I mean, look at the trials that are taking place now based on things that transpired [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=405.36s)]
*  several years ago. But at least the public can see this for what it is. I mean, Donald Trump is saying [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=410.8s)]
*  at events, if you want to come up and make a speech, give me a million dollars. I'll let you do it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=417.76000000000005s)]
*  And people said, yes, two people jumped up on that stage, Congressman. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=422.64s)]
*  Yeah. And that in itself might be a campaign finance violation. Again, we've got a kind of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  dysfunctional arrangement at the FEC because the Republicans blockade any action. But, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=434.4s)]
*  you know, he asked for a million dollars, which is more when you add it up than all of the different [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  elements he could actually be soliciting for. But again, I don't want to place too much faith in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=446.0s)]
*  the legal system, the campaign finance regime. I'm putting my faith in the people. The people [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  have got to understand what's going on. We've got two completely contrasting schools of thought [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  about what government is. And one says government must be an instrument for the common good for all [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  of the people. And the other says government is a simple money-making operation, an instrument [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=466.88s)]
*  for private self-enrichment for the guy who gets in and his family and his businesses. And that's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  what the GOP has become. And that's the scandal and that's the shame of all of these Republicans [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=477.76s)]
*  who are, you know, taking the metro liner up to New York so they can prove to Donald Trump how [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=483.2s)]
*  much they love him. They may be learning the wonders of Amtrak. Congressman Jamie Raskin, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  thank you so much, as always, for getting us started. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=495.36s)]
*  This morning's Consumer Price Index report showed inflation may finally be slowing down. As you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=499.12s)]
*  heard there, the top cost of all goods in the economy came in below expectation, with year over [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=504.4s)]
*  year inflation coming right on target. It's a bit of good news for both American consumers and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  President Biden, as inflation remains a top issue for voters ahead of the November election. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=514.56s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat of Massachusetts. She serves on the Chamber's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=519.68s)]
*  Banking and Finance Committees and shares the Economic Policy Subcommittee. And she joins me [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  now. Senator, good evening to you. This is the last report before the Fed is going to meet on [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=528.24s)]
*  interest rates. How might Chair Powell be looking at this? Look, what he should be observing is both [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=535.04s)]
*  that inflation is headed in the right direction, which is down, but also that it's time to lower [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=542.0s)]
*  interest rates because the problems we have on pricing right now are not problems from some kind [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=547.44s)]
*  of overheated economy. What we really have is a problem with a lot of price gouging from giant [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=553.44s)]
*  corporations. And there's nothing about Fed interest rates that is going to change that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=561.12s)]
*  We also know that the Fed inflation number reflects about a third of it is for housing costs. And part [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  of the problem we have right now is that when interest rates are high, that drives up the cost [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  of housing. Both you don't get new starts for apartments and more investment in it, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=579.68s)]
*  and also homeowners. The costs have gone up for them. So it's time to start bringing those interest [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  rates down. We're headed in the right direction and we don't need them nearly as high as they are. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  Senator, when I talk to voters, I hear two things. I hear about housing, which you just referenced, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=598.8s)]
*  and I hear about food. Food at home index declined 0.2%. You've called on the president to use [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  executive authority to lower food prices. Explain to me how that would work. So understand what this [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=609.36s)]
*  is. President Biden's one of his central issues is to work on bringing down costs for families. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=615.84s)]
*  And he's been very successful at doing that on junk fees. You know, everything from buying airline [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=624.08s)]
*  tickets to concert tickets to junk fees on check over drafts and credit card fees. He's pushing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=631.12s)]
*  down costs for families. The other thing he's done is he's been bringing down costs on health care. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=639.84s)]
*  We all know about $35 insulin and the fact that seniors now spend no more than $2,000 maximum [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=647.2s)]
*  across a year on their prescription drugs. He's bringing down the cost of other prescription [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=654.88s)]
*  drugs for everyone. So that's a big one. He's canceled student loan debt for four and a half [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=660.32s)]
*  million people. That helps bring down costs. He also has been focusing on grocery prices and has [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  been bringing his administration to bear on this. And it's particularly here where what we see is a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  lot of concentration in the industry. We see basically four major grocery chains who just [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of own the world out there in the grocery space and you back it up, the supply chain. So [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=687.28s)]
*  it's just a couple that are doing meat processing, chicken processing, and it even goes further back. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=692.9599999999999s)]
*  Farmers are getting squeezed because there's so much concentration that can only buy seeds [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=701.28s)]
*  from one or two suppliers. And the consequence of that kind of concentration up and down the line [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=706.72s)]
*  is that at every point where there's not real market concentration, it means that the company [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  can say not only are we going to pass along costs when they go up, we're going to lard on extra, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=721.36s)]
*  extra, extra profits. So what we've seen, for example, in profiteering by these giant companies [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=729.28s)]
*  is that profits increased by 75%. That's not inflation. That's profits going up because [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=738.2399999999999s)]
*  these companies have figured out that when everyone's talking about inflation, that's the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  time to raise prices. And by the way, don't take my word for it. Take the word of the CEOs themselves [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  who get on these quarterly calls with their investors and basically say inflation has been [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  good to them because it's let them raise prices way above costs. And that's a problem. We want to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=766.48s)]
*  see the president use more tools to attack it. Well, let's talk about those tools because there's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=774.48s)]
*  actually some big news on Capitol Hill today. The FAA reauthorization bill that passed the House [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=779.12s)]
*  is now headed to President Biden's desk with a provision that codified the Biden administration's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=783.36s)]
*  automatic refunds for travelers. I want you to talk to me about what it required to get that [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  provision in there and how the traveling public's going to feel it. Oh, so this one is really good [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=793.28s)]
*  news both for anyone who ever flies, buys a plane ticket, but it's also good news for anyone who [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  just believes in basic fairness. So here's the deal. You buy an airline ticket and then it turns [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  out they just cancel your flight. You'd think you'd get your money back, right? Well, the airline [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  companies, wow, there's this part and there's this part and jump through this hoop and then [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=817.6s)]
*  do a dance backwards and maybe we'll give you a credit or a voucher. And the airline companies [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=821.36s)]
*  are now sitting on billions of dollars in vouchers for flights that maybe someday [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=827.84s)]
*  customers will figure out how to cash in on. So basically the Biden administration said no more. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=836.16s)]
*  And so the Department of Transportation said when an airline cancels a flight, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=843.44s)]
*  they have to refund automatically the price that the person paid for the ticket. Unless the person [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=848.88s)]
*  wants to rebook, they're going to have to give the money back. After all, they've already got all the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  credit card information. They know what happened to the flight. Give people their money back. Yay, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=860.24s)]
*  we all celebrate. Then the airline industry, which I just got to say, talk about a ferocious [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  lobbying outfit. They're there all the time, but with FAA reauthorization up, they're like on, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=872.72s)]
*  you know, high speed, ready to go. So the airline industry lobby, lobby, lobby, push, push, push. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=878.8s)]
*  And four days after the Biden rule comes out, the new FAA authorization has just a little line [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=885.36s)]
*  buried on page 429 that says after the customer applies, then you have to give money back. And of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=892.64s)]
*  course, who's going to determine how you apply? It's going to be the airlines. So the Biden [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=903.52s)]
*  administration came roaring back. I did an amendment with Josh Hawley and with Ed Markey [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=909.92s)]
*  and said, no, it's going to be automatic. We fought, we got it into the bill. And now [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  that's exactly what it's going to be. If they sell you a ticket, then cancel the flight. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=924.8s)]
*  They got to give you your money back. Basic fairness and one more time of Joe Biden out there [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=930.8s)]
*  fighting, not for the rich airlines, not for their lobbyists, but fighting for regular folks who just [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=937.92s)]
*  want a level playing field, a little fairness. This is Joe Biden doing Joe Biden at his best. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=945.36s)]
*  Senator, I want you to take a listen to what your colleague Ted Cruz had to say about his opposition [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=951.52s)]
*  to this. Here you go. I got to say this, this is one of the silliest stories I have ever seen. So [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=955.84s)]
*  the FAA reauthorization bill is a bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  unanimously. Every Republican, every Democrat supported it. It also came out of the House [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  Committee unanimously. We just had a vote yesterday on the Senate floor. The vote in favor of moving [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=970.56s)]
*  to the bill was 89 to 10. So you're saying, oh, there's a lot of controversy about over this. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=976.16s)]
*  You know what the controversy is? One tweet by Elizabeth Warren. Senator, now that it is headed [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=981.5999999999999s)]
*  to the president's desk, your response to the Senator from Texas. Well, Ted, it turns out that a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=988.16s)]
*  lot of people, once they discovered what page 429 said, didn't like it. And so the bill that is going, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=995.44s)]
*  that passed the Senate, passed the House today and is going to the president of the United States [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1003.12s)]
*  says we're going to have automatic refunds. And I get it. Ted Cruz, he's out there pushing hard to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  try to help those airlines be even more profitable. And this is going to cost the airlines some money. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1015.44s)]
*  Boo hoo. But for somebody who thinks in basic fairness that if you don't deliver the product, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1021.68s)]
*  you ought to have to give the money back. That's what Joe Biden thinks. And that's what we managed [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1028.56s)]
*  to get through. And I just want to be clear. It is now the law. Soon as Joe Biden signs it in, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1033.68s)]
*  it is the law. Airlines have got to give your money back. And that's right. And that's fair. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1040.56s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden does for us. Senator Elizabeth Warren, as always, thank you so much for your time. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnSWH4NVMY&t=1046.32s)]
