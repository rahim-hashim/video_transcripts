# House Republicans stall effort to expel George Santos from Congress
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s)
*  House Democrats forced their Republican colleagues to take action on Congressman George Santos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=0.0s)]
*  after the scandal-plagued Republican was indicted on more than a dozen federal charges last [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=5.92s)]
*  week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=10.92s)]
*  Democrats used a fairly obscure provision in the House rolls to make the Republican-controlled [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=11.92s)]
*  chamber take up the question of whether or not to expel Santos, called a privileged resolution. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=16.64s)]
*  Now, House Republicans really don't want to do that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=22.6s)]
*  They know, of course, Santos is a serial liar who has been accused of a litany of crimes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=25.64s)]
*  grifts and schemes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=29.92s)]
*  They need his vote anyway. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=31.6s)]
*  So this afternoon, Kevin McCarthy's Republicans once again tried to just bury the whole thing, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=33.4s)]
*  sweep it under the rug. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=37.56s)]
*  Instead of an up or down vote on whether or not to expel Santos, Republicans voted instead [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=39.24s)]
*  along party lines to kick the issue over to the House Ethics Committee, which, get this, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  is already investigating Santos. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=49.44s)]
*  After the vote, an ever defiant Santos spoke to reporters outside Capitol Hill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=52.44s)]
*  I have not done my job since I've gotten here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=57.32s)]
*  I can chew and walk gum at the same time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=60.2s)]
*  I can chew gum and walk at the same time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=62.36s)]
*  I have not been convicted of any crime. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=64.52s)]
*  You insist on saying that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=67.56s)]
*  I will have my day to defend myself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=68.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Becca Ballant is a Democrat of Vermont. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=73.16s)]
*  She's one of the co-sponsors of the resolution to expel George Santos, and she joins me now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=76.36s)]
*  Congresswoman, you succeeded in getting a privileged resolution taken up and dealt with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  on the floor. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=85.64s)]
*  What's your reaction to the vote today? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=86.96s)]
*  It's incredibly disappointing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=87.96s)]
*  It is a dark day for America when you can't even get a serial liar, a fraudster, someone [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=90.92s)]
*  who pulled the wool over the eyes of all the voters in his district. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=98.92s)]
*  You can't even get that kind of person expelled from Congress. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=105.18s)]
*  It's a very sad day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=109.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've talked to a lot of members of Congress about George Santos. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=110.8s)]
*  Robert Garcia is the president of the freshman class. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of New York congressmen who have a kind of, what the heck is this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  dude doing in our state caucus feeling? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=122.0s)]
*  What's your motivation here? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  I imagine it doesn't matter one way or the other that your constituents in Vermont and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  your voters, there's no huge political upside or downside here, but you seem pretty motivated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=131.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=135.8s)]
*  I really appreciate that question. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=136.8s)]
*  I ran for this seat because of the actions of the Trump supporters on January 6th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=138.52s)]
*  I believe this is an inflection moment for our democracy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=146.2s)]
*  Democracies don't fail overnight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  They fail little by little as norms are upended, as integrity is eroded. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  And I feel very strongly that I have to be able to look my own kids in the eye when I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=157.44s)]
*  come home to Vermont on the weekends when they ask me, how is it that a serial liar [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=161.64s)]
*  can continue to serve in Congress and be paid by the American people? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=167.64s)]
*  I think about all of the students that I taught. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=173.84s)]
*  I was a history and civics teacher for a long time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=175.76s)]
*  My motivation is about protecting the democracy, absolutely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=179.24s)]
*  And actually, Vermonters care a whole lot about this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=182.92s)]
*  I should note just some news today when you talk about him being a serial liar. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=186.2s)]
*  The vote today was partisan for the reasons we explained in the intro, but the sentiment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=191.16s)]
*  is not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=195.04s)]
*  All the Republicans in his home county have called on him to resign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=196.04s)]
*  The five or six members of the Republican Party in New York have called on him to resign, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=199.48s)]
*  though crucially didn't vote for it today, which is notable. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=203.32s)]
*  He also lost a staffer today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=208.84s)]
*  Nasa Wumer, who's the communications director, has resigned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  She tells Scripps News, with respect for my colleagues, the people of New York, and most [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=215.0s)]
*  importantly myself, I am honored to tender my resignation, Wumer said in her resignation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=218.72s)]
*  email. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=223.4s)]
*  She said the departure appearing to direct the comment towards Santos. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=224.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, you never took one point of professional advice given. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=226.92s)]
*  I suppose that's not surprising. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you think we'll see more of that over time? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=231.2s)]
*  Here's the thing that you have to understand is that there have been a series of votes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  that have been taken on the floor in the last few months, and George Santos is at times [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  applauded by his colleagues, especially if he's a deciding vote. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  They are certainly interested in protecting him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=250.27999999999997s)]
*  And that speaks to where this party is and where this conference is at this moment, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=254.04s)]
*  when you have members of his conference standing up and applauding him when he takes a vote. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=259.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, voters back in New York do not feel like they are represented. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=266.68s)]
*  This is really an American issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=270.68s)]
*  Every voter should feel like they know who they're voting for. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  And the person that they voted for was not, in fact, George Santos. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=276.24s)]
*  It was somebody entirely different from that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  I just think that this is an indication of a deep rot, and we as members of Congress [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=282.12s)]
*  need to do everything that we can to return some semblance of integrity to the body. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  You're also calling for a censure of another one of your colleagues, and I think your description [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  about your motivation to run sheds some light on your motivation here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=302.26s)]
*  You issued a letter calling on Representative Gosar, who we've covered on this program last [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=308.56s)]
*  few evenings, to be censured, saying his history of associating with and now hiring white nationalists [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=312.24s)]
*  and neo-Nazis is deeply disturbing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=317.08s)]
*  The presence of proud neo-Nazis is a threat to people of color, Jewish Americans who work [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=319.24s)]
*  here at the Capitol, as well as people we serve. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=322.76s)]
*  Speaker Mark Carthy must hold Rep. Gosar accountable for this kind of overt neo-Nazi sympathizing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=324.8s)]
*  that's pursuant, of course, to Hunter Walker's reporting about this we featured on the program. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=329.28s)]
*  Has there been any official response to this from anyone in Republican leadership or from [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Gosar's office? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=340.32s)]
*  We haven't gotten any. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=341.32s)]
*  Not at this time, and I just want to be really clear, too. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=343.04s)]
*  I am the grandchild of somebody who was killed in the Holocaust. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=346.20000000000005s)]
*  My grandfather was killed in the last few weeks of the war on a forced march from the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=350.72s)]
*  concentration camp that he was a prisoner in in Austria. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=355.6s)]
*  This is very personal to me, that I should not have to worry about walking these halls [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=360.4s)]
*  of Congress with Nazis, about neo-Nazis serving in the offices of people who serve on committee [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=366.58s)]
*  with me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=373.9s)]
*  What has happened to this nation? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_DLQSpe_s&t=375.12s)]
