# MAGA candidate Mark Robinson vows to stay in race after bombshell 'Black Nazi' report
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg)
*  Republicans are positively freaking the heck out. You see, the deadline to withdraw from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=0.0s)]
*  state's gubernatorial election is four hours from now. The state Republican party really wants its [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=6.72s)]
*  candidate, Mark Robinson, to drop out. Even by the standards of Donald Trump's hand-picked freaks and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=11.84s)]
*  geeks, Mark Robinson is a uniquely terrible candidate. He's got a history, open history, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=17.2s)]
*  of rank anti-Semitism, along with a bunch of other bigoted statements. He's made grotesque [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=23.12s)]
*  anti-abortion ads accusing women of not being responsible enough to keep your skirt down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=29.2s)]
*  Just two weeks ago, he had to deny a report that he was once a five nights a week attendee at [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=33.92s)]
*  multiple porn shops where he often brought a pizza into a private booth with him. All that had been a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=38.56s)]
*  known quantity. Seemed fine with Trump and his party, and yet, and yet, and yet, this afternoon [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=44.0s)]
*  we started to hear this chatter that Republicans, including members of the Trump campaign, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=48.56s)]
*  had suddenly decided it was time for Robinson to go, and then we learned why. Around 3 30 p.m. CNN [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=52.16s)]
*  dropped a report that Robinson made a series of inflammatory comments on a pornography website's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=58.8s)]
*  message board more than a decade ago in which he referred to himself as a quote black Nazi [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=64.64s)]
*  and expressed support for reinstating slavery. The extensive and thorough report by the excellent [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=70.72s)]
*  reporters at CNN provides overwhelming evidence that Mark Robinson was indeed the one making [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=77.6s)]
*  the comments on the website Nude Africa, including the fact that he signed up for an account using [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=84.24s)]
*  his actual name, Mark Robinson. He used the same username and email address for other accounts on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=90.32s)]
*  multiple other websites. In the report Robinson says he wants to own slaves and calls himself a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=98.08s)]
*  Nazi, wrote that he preferred the former leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, over the leadership [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=104.88s)]
*  in Washington during the administration of Barack Obama. I'd take Hitler over any of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=109.92s)]
*  expletive that's in Washington right now. Also Robinson graphically described his own sexual [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=116.08s)]
*  arousal as an adult from the memory of secretly peeping on women in public gym showers as a 14 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=121.84s)]
*  year old. Robinson recounted the stories and memory he said he still fantasized about. What's more, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=126.88s)]
*  Robinson said he enjoyed watching transgender pornography, a review of archived messages found [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=133.12s)]
*  in which he also referred to himself as a quote, perv. Now, of course, it is our position strongly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=137.84s)]
*  here on this program. Consenting adults in a free country should be free to produce and consume [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=144.4s)]
*  any kind of pornography should they want to. Transgender pornography obviously included. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=149.52s)]
*  It does however present a stark contrast with what Robinson says now about LGBTQ folks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=154.96s)]
*  There's no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling anytime about transgenderism, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=162.24s)]
*  homosexuality, any of that filth. And yes, I call it filth. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=170.4s)]
*  Does seem to be a bit of a filth expert. In an interview tonight, Robinson denied that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=175.52s)]
*  any of the messages belonged to him. This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=180.56s)]
*  anything that is characteristic of me nor has it ever been. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=186.56s)]
*  How do you explain all of the matching details on this profile? The profile on Nude Africa lists [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  your full name as Mark Robinson. The email listed on the account is an email that you have used [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  elsewhere on the internet, including with your photo. You have used that name, Mini Soldier, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  on multiple social media accounts, including Twitter, Pinterest, Black Planet, and YouTube. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=208.0s)]
*  How can you deny with all of these matching details that this is you? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=213.52s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured these [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=218.16s)]
*  salacious tabloid lies. We should also note that the report uncovered some very specific language [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  used in the posts at issue, uncommon phrases such as gag a maggot, dunderhead, I don't give a frog's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=229.28s)]
*  ass, and I don't give two shakes of it. They were used by the account on Nude Africa and by Mark [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=236.4s)]
*  Robinson on his personal Facebook page. Also, according to the report, Robinson spoke admirably [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=243.04s)]
*  about the KKK, implying he would join if the hate group allowed black members, made disparaging [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=249.28s)]
*  remarks about Luther King Jr. calling him a racial slur and an effing commie bastard, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  more than a bit ironic considering what Trump likes to say about his good friend, Mark Robinson. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=259.68s)]
*  I said to this man, and when he endorsed me, he gave a speech and I said, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=265.52s)]
*  you are Dr. Martin Luther King on steroids. That's how good you are. You are unbelievable [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=271.35999999999996s)]
*  as a speaker. And he got up and he's doing fantastically well in North Carolina. And I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=278.56s)]
*  think he's going to be the next governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=283.28s)]
*  I don't know if I'd put money on that bet right now. In fact, Donald Trump and his family have [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=289.28s)]
*  said a lot of nice things about the man who called himself a black Nazi and reportedly praised Hitler. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Thanks as well to, I think, one of the hottest politicians in the United States of America and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  has become a friend of mine, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=306.4s)]
*  We have to be very, very careful. We have to cherish. We have to cherish Mark. He's a star. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=312.32s)]
*  You have to cherish him. It's like a fine wine because that's what you have. You have a fine wine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=316.88s)]
*  He's an outstanding person. I've gotten it up so well and fairly quickly. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=322.08s)]
*  I want to thank a very good man. And he's in there fighting. He's fighting. And we know he's a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  fighter. The next governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. Thanks, Mark. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=332.24s)]
*  Well, we know them. We know them well. We know Mark very well. Amazing, amazing, amazing guy. But [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=342.32s)]
*  Mark is a wonderful person, a wonderful guy, a person I've gotten to know very, very well. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=348.32s)]
*  And I think not only are we going to win this day, I think he's going to win this day. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  It now seems as though Donald Trump might be trying to distance himself from the fine wine [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  of a candidate, at least according to the Carolina Journal, citing an anonymous source. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=360.88000000000005s)]
*  Robinson is under pressure from staff and members of the Trump campaign to withdraw from the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=364.32000000000005s)]
*  governor's race. And that earlier this week, leaders in the Trump campaign privately told [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  Robinson he was not welcome at rallies for Trump or vice presidential candidate JD Vance. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  He was slated to speak at the Vance appearance on Wednesday, but his office announced [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  that Robinson had tested positive for COVID. Now Robinson's pretty far down the polls while the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=382.24s)]
*  top of the ticket is locked in a tie in North Carolina. And to be clear, the deadline for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=388.64s)]
*  Robinson to withdraw is today. He's got less than four hours as of now. State losses candidate can [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=392.24s)]
*  pull out of the race up until the day before absentee ballots start to go out for overseas [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=398.56s)]
*  service members. Those ballots go out tomorrow. Robinson's name is already on them. But according [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=402.48s)]
*  Robinson doesn't matter anyway, because he is not going anywhere. Let me reassure you the things [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=407.44s)]
*  that you will see in that story. Those are not the words of Mark Robinson. Clarence Thomas famously [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=413.92s)]
*  once said he was the victim of a high tech lynching. Well, it looks like Mark Robinson is too. We are [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=420.0s)]
*  staying in this race. We are in it to win it. And we know that with your help, we will. I for one [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  feel reassured. Now let's just take a step back here. Maybe Mark Robinson is the most extreme [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=431.36s)]
*  version of the anti-social MAGA candidate. But is he really that much more extreme than JD Vance, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=436.0s)]
*  who's just spent the last two weeks spreading essentially blood libel about Haitian residents [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  of his home state? And what about Donald Trump, who also bragged about peeping on women while they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=447.2s)]
*  undress to say nothing of boasting of sexual assault and then getting found libel for sexual abuse [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=453.92s)]
*  by a jury? The guy who broke bread at his home with a man who praised Hitler and avowed white [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=459.44s)]
*  supremacists? This is the Republican Party under Donald Trump. I had to say North Carolina Republicans. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=465.44s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a little hard to return your candidate now, you know? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=472.48s)]
*  You broke it, you bought it. Mark Robinson is your guy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mDnPECIArg&t=475.68s)]
