Video Description: The Senate once again took a vote on protecting IVF, but Trump—the self-proclaimed “leader on fertilization” who is never shy about forcing his Republicans to support or kill a bill—was nowhere to be found. All but two Republicans voted against the bill—and JD Vance skipped the vote. Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) joins to discuss.

# GOP kills IVF bill one week after Trump claims to be ‘leader on fertilization’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28)
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America, I have been a leader on IVF, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=0.0s)]
*  is fertilization. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=3.7s)]
*  The IVF, I have been a leader. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=4.7s)]
*  In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=7.46s)]
*  people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=13.58s)]
*  I have been a leader on it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=17.86s)]
*  They know that, and everybody else knows it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=19.7s)]
*  I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=22.02s)]
*  It's been a week since Donald Trump made that instantly classic proclamation, I have been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=25.360000000000003s)]
*  a leader on fertilization. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  Of course, everyone who pays any attention to the issue of reproductive rights knows [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=31.480000000000004s)]
*  that it's Trump's party that has been mobilizing against in vitro fertilization. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=35.44s)]
*  Indeed, it was Trump's handpicked MAGA Supreme Court that paved the way for IVF to be threatened [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=39.6s)]
*  in the first place as it was in Alabama when that court overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, there is an actual way to fix this problem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=52.22s)]
*  You could just pass a law in Congress signed by the president protecting access to IVF. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=55.82s)]
*  It's something Democrats have actually been trying to do all year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=60.78s)]
*  In fact, today, the Senate once again took a vote on protecting in vitro fertilization [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=63.26s)]
*  at the federal level, but the leader on fertilization, who we should note is never shy about forcing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=68.34s)]
*  his Republicans to support a kill a bill, he was nowhere to be found. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=75.06s)]
*  Didn't say a single thing on it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=79.22s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=81.78s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=82.78s)]
*  The measure was rejected by all but two Republicans. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=83.78s)]
*  Trump's vice presidential candidate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, who was so committed to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=87.04s)]
*  this issue, didn't even bother to show up to vote. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=91.88s)]
*  Senator Lafonza Butler is a Democrat of California. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=95.88s)]
*  She voted to protect IVF access today, and she joins me now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=98.16s)]
*  I guess the result was not surprising today, Senator, although I did wonder after the leader [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=103.4s)]
*  of the Republican Party staked out this claim that he was a leader in IVF. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=109.46s)]
*  He even talked about federal support, mandating insurance companies, that he would whip votes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=113.06s)]
*  on this, that they would, I mean, nothing changed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=119.22s)]
*  Chris, thanks for having me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=124.22s)]
*  And unfortunately, nothing changed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=128.78s)]
*  As we've heard the same tired old stories from Donald Trump, the concepts of his plans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=132.68s)]
*  for the American people here, they had an opportunity, the Republican Party had an opportunity [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  to actually put action behind their words. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=145.56s)]
*  And you and I both know the leader's lead and the way in which President Trump rallied [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  Republican voters with just, Republican senators with just a tweet to tank the border security [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  legislation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=162.0s)]
*  He didn't say a word. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=163.0s)]
*  He didn't even tweet or utilize, you know, truth social to communicate his views or direction [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=164.52s)]
*  that he would give to Republican senators. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=172.74s)]
*  And we ended up in the exact same place that the American people were before, with their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=176.1s)]
*  rights and freedoms to make decisions about their own bodies, to expand their families, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=181.94s)]
*  exactly where we were prior to today's vote. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=187.9s)]
*  And it's shameful. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=190.54s)]
*  And the American people shouldn't believe a word he says. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=191.56s)]
*  You know, I think one of the things that's a little gaslighty about this whole thing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=194.2s)]
*  is Republicans keep saying, like, we love IVF. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=199.6s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=201.64s)]
*  Like, there's no there's nothing here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=202.64s)]
*  And then voting to block it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=204.14s)]
*  And I think the reality underneath that, and I'm curious if this is how you see it from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=205.14s)]
*  the Senate, is that there is a large faction of the Republican Party and conservative movement [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  who believes that a fertilized egg is a person with the full rights under the Constitution [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=215.12s)]
*  of you or I and that in vitro fertilization is as bad as killing a person, that every [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=220.46s)]
*  fertilized embryo is right, and that the whole process is wrong and should be made illegal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=228.26s)]
*  Those people exist and they do wield power in the Republican Party, which seems to me [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=233.3s)]
*  the reason you're getting these no votes, unless I'm misreading the situation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=237.46s)]
*  Chris, you know you're reading it exactly right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=243.3s)]
*  That is exactly how the Alabama legislature wound up in a position to have to affirmatively [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=247.42s)]
*  protect IVF in their state laws because their their state Supreme Court had that exact interpretation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=253.72s)]
*  because of laws that have been passed years prior. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=262.44s)]
*  Doing that exact thing, saying that a fertilized embryo had the same rights and destroying [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  a fertilized embryo embryo was consistent with murder. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=272.52s)]
*  So here is where we find ourselves. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=278.14s)]
*  They have painted this picture and sort of gone down this road of defying the American [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=279.5s)]
*  people the ability to make decisions about their own body for decades. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  And now that the MAGA Supreme Court has ripped away the rights of Roe, the emperor has no [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  clothes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=296.7s)]
*  It is truly clear their intention to control the decisions of women and their bodies in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=297.7s)]
*  this country and there's no turning back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=303.61999999999995s)]
*  So they've tried to hide and bend and shape shift every position at every opportunity [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=306.8s)]
*  and today in the United States Senate they have the opportunity to make it clear to the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  American people that they stand with them and their right to make these decisions and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=316.72s)]
*  to advance their families and we now know exactly what they believe. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=321.88s)]
*  You have known Vice President Kamala Harris for a long time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=327.6s)]
*  You knew her when she was a senator, you've known her in California for a very long time. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=331.26s)]
*  You know her very well both as a politician and as a person. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=337.06s)]
*  And I'm just curious as someone who has known her for a long time, what are you making of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=339.98s)]
*  all this? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=346.68s)]
*  Like watching someone that you know as well as you know the vice president put in a position [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=347.68s)]
*  to perform at the level that she has to perform at, and so far doing that, what do you think? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=352.6s)]
*  Look, if this were an Olympic game she'd be sticking the landing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  She is doing outstanding and I am not surprised. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=367.86s)]
*  I have seen her leadership up close and personal in good times and in bad, making decisions [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=371.3s)]
*  every single day on behalf of the American people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=379.3s)]
*  And I'm not surprised Chris because it is exactly who she is. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=383.5s)]
*  And she has been that way, a fearless fighter for the people her entire career. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  And it really does my heart proud, but most importantly I think for the American people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  to get the opportunity to get to know her in the way that many of us who have known [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=400.9s)]
*  her for a long time really speaks to the kind of leadership that our country needs in this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=404.82s)]
*  moment. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=410.29999999999995s)]
*  And for all of those Kamala curious voters out there, she's doing a great job extending [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=411.29999999999995s)]
*  an invitation to build a new way forward for this country and unite us as a people. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=416.58s)]
*  And I'm proud to be able to do it with her. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=422.76s)]
*  California Senator Lafonza Butler, thank you very much for your time tonight, appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqu4JFtwa28&t=425.0s)]
