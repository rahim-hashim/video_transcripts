# Chris Hayes reads ‘deranged’ transcript of Trump RNC speech: 'Obviously in decline'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM)
*  For any of the more than 20 million people who reportedly watched Donald Trump's convention [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=0.0s)]
*  speech last night, two things were plain as day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=4.8s)]
*  First, there is no change in his tone. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=7.72s)]
*  Expectations that his prepared remarks would offer a heartfelt appeal for national unity [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=10.0s)]
*  met the reality of a rambling, self-indulgent 93-minute Trump rally speech, full of lies [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=13.96s)]
*  about the Democratic Party weaponizing the justice system and the China virus and a migrant [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=19.0s)]
*  invasion, including really sad and upsetting lurid tales of crime. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=23.84s)]
*  Invasion was a word he used 13 times. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=30.64s)]
*  Now, the second thing, which I said before, but I just want to take a second with is, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=32.6s)]
*  again, this is an aging man who's obviously in decline. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=37.88s)]
*  He's 78 years old. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=40.28s)]
*  He's just three years younger than President Joe Biden. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=42.28s)]
*  If Biden had delivered that same speech, including some of the sections I'm going to read you, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=44.84s)]
*  the news stories today would be about the hiccups and the gaffes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  They would. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=51.68s)]
*  Instead, we got headlines that, to my mind, massively mischaracterize the speech, perhaps [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=52.92s)]
*  having been written off of the prepared remarks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Trump takes a unity tone, declared the Pioneer Press of St. Paul, Minnesota. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=61.64s)]
*  Trump emphasizes unity, the Dallas Morning News reported. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=65.56s)]
*  Boston Globe, quote, in a departure, Trump calls for unity healing in America with a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=68.48s)]
*  subhead that says Trump describes assassination attempt says God was on his side. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=73.6s)]
*  Now, that part is true. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=77.88s)]
*  But the unity part or not, that's not an accurate characterization of the whole speech, just [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=80.24s)]
*  not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=83.64s)]
*  So I want to read you straight from a transcript of Trump's speech to show you what I mean. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=84.64s)]
*  And the reason I'm going to read it to you is I have found often reading the transcript [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=91.32s)]
*  fully communicates what we're dealing with here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  So in his own words, we will replenish our military and build an Iron Dome missile defense [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=97.44s)]
*  system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=103.96s)]
*  This great Iron Dome will be built entirely in the USA. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to build it in the USA. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  OK, just to be clear here, this is actually a plank in the RNC platform and it's completely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  deranged. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=117.56s)]
*  OK, this would be like a child conjuring up what they think American defense policy is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=118.92s)]
*  Iron Dome protects from very short range rockets that are fired from Gaza and sometimes from [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=125.92000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon into Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  No one's firing rockets from Quebec or from Guadalajara. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=134.8s)]
*  There's no nothing to do there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  We're not under assault from short range rockets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  Also, the system costs billions of dollars for a state the size of New Jersey. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  We're talking like a trillion dollar investment for something that doesn't exist as a threat. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  It literally makes no sense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=156.52s)]
*  And it is in the RNC platform. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=157.56s)]
*  First part, he continues. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  And now he's ad-libbing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=161.44s)]
*  OK, that first part of the speech, now he's ad-libbing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=162.44s)]
*  I'm Wisconsin. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=164.28s)]
*  Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=165.28s)]
*  You're doing a very nice job, Governor, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=168.36s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=170.28s)]
*  And they're doing a great job. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=171.28s)]
*  OK, so as far as I can tell here, Trump was looking over to Scott Walker, who did indeed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=173.28s)]
*  serve as Wisconsin's governor five years ago and is not the governor now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=177.8s)]
*  You're doing a great job, Governor, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=184.64s)]
*  Not governor now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=188.4s)]
*  From the transcript again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=189.84s)]
*  OK, so he changed the destroyers to look like yachts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=191.84s)]
*  I said we have to take the bow. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=200.88s)]
*  We have to make it a little nicer, a little point at the top instead of flat nose. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=201.88s)]
*  The people of the shipyard said this guy sort of knows what he's doing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=204.76s)]
*  After he does the whole riff on the destroyers, he then goes back to Iron Dome. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Again, Iron Dome. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=211.88s)]
*  Israel has an Iron Dome. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=213.56s)]
*  They have a missile defense system. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=215.08s)]
*  It's not a missile defense system, by the way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=216.6s)]
*  It's a rocket defense system. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=218.04s)]
*  342 missiles were shot into Israel and only one got through a little bit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=219.88s)]
*  It was badly wounded. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=223.32s)]
*  I think he's talking about the rocket. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=224.32s)]
*  It fell to the ground, but most of them are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=226.28s)]
*  And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didn't have the technology many [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=228.16s)]
*  years ago. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Remember they called it Starship, Spaceship, anything to mock them? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, that, of course, is wrong. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=236.72s)]
*  Reagan's plan was nicknamed Star Wars, which he obviously couldn't remember. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=238.96s)]
*  So he said Starship, which is the rock band that sang We Built This City back in Trump's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=242.96s)]
*  heyday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=247.96s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan is the author of Win Every Argument, The Argument of Bating, also the founder and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=249.6s)]
*  editor-in-chief of the new media organization Zetio. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=252.6s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=255.28s)]
*  I do think, Mehdi, just going through the script today, that, again, part of it is that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=256.64s)]
*  he always sort of sounds like this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=261.48s)]
*  So there is a kind of acclamation that has already happened. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  But it is worth just actually encountering it, trying to encounter it afresh, still has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=268.04s)]
*  to cover it accurately. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=274.12s)]
*  I mean, Trump is a dog bites man on a grand scale, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=277.12s)]
*  He's so inured as and immunized as to his craziness and derangement and dishonesty that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=281.56s)]
*  we all kind of move on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=287.12s)]
*  And, Chris, you showed some excellent headlines from kind of state and regional and city papers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=288.12s)]
*  The New York Times, the paper of record, their headline on the speech was, after an emotional [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=292.8s)]
*  beginning, Trump veers into familiar partisan attacks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=300.68s)]
*  Not only does that underplay the derangement of the speech, as you've just pointed out, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=301.68s)]
*  but I think the word familiar is very important there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=305.36s)]
*  Familiar partisan attacks. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=307.24s)]
*  Journalists don't like familiar, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=308.44s)]
*  They don't want familiar. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  They want new and shiny. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=311.64s)]
*  And Trump's insanity and bigotry and dishonesty is all very familiar. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=313.76s)]
*  So we've just normalized it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=319.44s)]
*  We've normalized the abnormal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  We've mainstreamed his extremism. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=322.8s)]
*  And that is a fundamental problem, because you then end up gaslighting your readers and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=324.48s)]
*  your viewers by pretending that the speech was somehow normal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=329.0s)]
*  I interviewed a member of the Washington Post editorial board earlier today who said, well, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=331.72s)]
*  when I said it was an insane speech, a crazy speech, he said, well, it was just normal [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  But that's the problem. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  Normal Trump is crazy, is insane, and we need to keep saying that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  But we don't, and therefore we, the media, are not doing our job. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and that point, there was something actually new about it, which I think was also [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=348.68s)]
*  worth noting. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  And Dave Wyvo, I thought, did a great job in his Americana newsletter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  He said Donald Trump walked onto the Fiserv Forum stage as a Caesar barely wounded by an [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=356.68s)]
*  assassin and in full command of his party. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  He walked off with comparisons to Castro, even from sympathetic conservatives, a dramatic [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=362.84s)]
*  retelling of the Butler shooting eased into the longest and most meandering acceptance [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  speech since candidates started showing up at conventions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=371.52s)]
*  I saw other people say, look, full stop, that's the worst convention speech I've ever seen. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=375.08s)]
*  I mean, and again, this is the point. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's also difficult. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Again, the conventions of all this, and I'm using the word advisedly, is such that, look, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  we're covering a convention. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=390.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=391.32s)]
*  Like in some ways, the normalization has been done by the Republican Party giving this man [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=392.8s)]
*  the nomination, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=397.56s)]
*  Like, we are going to cover the convention. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=398.56s)]
*  It is one of the two major party conventions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=400.36s)]
*  He is going to be on that ballot, you know, along the other one. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=402.24s)]
*  So you just got to work over time to find ways to communicate the weirdness. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=405.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=410.12s)]
*  And we're not working over time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=411.12s)]
*  We're not working within normal time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=413.8s)]
*  I mean, people say time travel is not possible. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=415.48s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  The media has time traveled back to 2016. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  This is the 2016 media excited about Trump, faux naive about his intent, constantly waiting [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=421.08s)]
*  for a change of tone, a new person. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=427.32s)]
*  This is the day he became president. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=429.44s)]
*  And it's killing me because, yes, you have to cover the convention. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=431.32s)]
*  Yes, it's a binary system, but you don't have to cover it in this way. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=434.0s)]
*  And I just think, look, the problem, of course, is, Chris, the elephant in the room is as [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=437.28s)]
*  long as Joe Biden is on the scene, journalists have the cop out of saying, well, hold on, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=440.36s)]
*  look at Joe Biden. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=444.84s)]
*  And I think about that debate, Chris, that you've already mentioned. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=445.84s)]
*  Donald Trump gave the second worst debate performance in American history. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=448.88000000000005s)]
*  The problem is the worst was given by Joe Biden next to him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=452.56s)]
*  So we didn't pay attention to what Trump said that night. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=455.44000000000005s)]
*  In any normal night, had we heard a candidate say when he's asked about his climate change [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  policy, you know what Trump said that night? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=461.32000000000005s)]
*  We had H2O. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=463.16s)]
*  That's a literal quote he said that night. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=464.16s)]
*  We had H2O. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  What on earth do you mean? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  But no one asked that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=471.36s)]
*  No one noticed because Biden was busy saying we beat Medicare or whatever it was. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=472.36s)]
*  So that is a fundamental problem that he's getting away with on multiple levels. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's also the case that, you know, to your point about that point about 2016, I [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=480.36s)]
*  think is good because I do see a lot of echoes that partly what's really frustrating about [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  that, too, is there's a record. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  There is a record. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=490.12s)]
*  He was he governed for four years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=491.12s)]
*  So if he's saying things like he's improvising a new tone on immigration that we want to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=493.24s)]
*  expand legal immigration. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=497.36s)]
*  Well, he reduced legal immigration when he was in office. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  There's a very clear record. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=501.56s)]
*  He made it nearly impossible to legally immigrate to this country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=502.68s)]
*  So you cannot. It's one thing in 2016 where it's like, well, what it will be like. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=505.96s)]
*  He did govern. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=509.48s)]
*  That's the other thing that I think has been missing is comparing whatever he's saying [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=510.48s)]
*  now, whatever the rhetoric is, whatever the 2.0 to an actual record. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=514.08s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned covid earlier, Chris. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=519.32s)]
*  It kills me that we just move on from the fact that several hundred thousand Americans [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=521.32s)]
*  are dead. Who should be alive today had Donald Trump done his job as commander in chief, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=524.2s)]
*  as president. We just gloss over that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=528.08s)]
*  And look, every headline today should have really been the one line in the speech that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=530.12s)]
*  really mattered, which was they cheated with covid. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen again. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  That is Donald Trump saying we're going to do it all again. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=537.72s)]
*  Insurrection, election interference. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=540.24s)]
*  We're going to do it all again. He said it twice. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  We're not going to let them do it again. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=544.08s)]
*  That should have been the headline on every newspaper today that the man calling for unity [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  actually says he's going to do another insurrection. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  That is that is the headline. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=551.72s)]
*  That was our headline, Eddie Haas. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzJ7IF1xMM&t=553.96s)]
