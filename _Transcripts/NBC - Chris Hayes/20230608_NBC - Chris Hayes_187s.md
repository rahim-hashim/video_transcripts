Video Description: Jen Psaki discusses the unavoidable political nature of the charges against Donald Trump in the classified documents case. "Trump is already fundraising off of this — or attempting to," Psaki says. "Biden is an institutionalist. He believes in the separation of the branches of government, and I suspect they will be very limited in anything they say about this at all, especially in the short term.

# Psaki Trump is already fundraising off this — but don't expect Biden to get involved yet
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM)
*  We've been talking about the law, Jen, and I want to talk a little bit about the politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, the politics are primary here because they're not. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=5.12s)]
*  I think ultimately the law is what matters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=7.2s)]
*  But it's also just inescapably political because the guy's running for president, he's the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=11.36s)]
*  ex-president, he's going to make it political, and you don't get to sort of unilaterally [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  declare what is and isn't political. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=20.56s)]
*  So from that perspective, I wonder how you think about how the Biden administration handles [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=21.76s)]
*  this, how Democrats handle this, how Republicans in Congress handle this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=27.16s)]
*  Like, this isn't Alvin Bragg in Manhattan who is not part of the Biden administration, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=31.0s)]
*  and you can heap scorn on him and you can say nasty things about him with all sorts of, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  you know, pretty gross racist undertones. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=40.04s)]
*  This is the Justice Department of the United States that Joe Biden is the president of at the moment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=44.36s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, look, I think Trump is clearly, and he already is fundraising off of this or [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  attempting to, and he is clearly going to try to gather the base around him as he did around the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=55.32s)]
*  indictment by Alvin Bragg. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=62.6s)]
*  This case is different for a range of reasons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=64.2s)]
*  One of them just on the pure messaging standpoint, a case where people are trying to communicate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=67.24s)]
*  publicly and critique about how a former president may have paid hush money to an adult film star [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  is a bit more complicated than this, which is somebody obstructing justice, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=79.48s)]
*  somebody withholding classified documents, potentially sharing them in a way that could [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=85.08s)]
*  harm our national security. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=89.24s)]
*  That is different, and we should acknowledge that in terms of how it will be communicated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=91.0s)]
*  In terms of the White House, the way that I expect they will handle it, Chris, and I don't think [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=96.36s)]
*  this will be any surprise to anyone on this panel, is, you know, Joe Biden is an institutionalist. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=100.92s)]
*  He believes in the separation of the branches of government, and I suspect they will be very [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=105.96s)]
*  limited in anything they say about this at all, especially in the short term. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=110.92s)]
*  Now, over the long term, if there are additional indictments, as Eric Holder just said, as Andrew [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=115.56s)]
*  Weissman has talked about, there are ways to, once you get past the pure politicization period of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=120.84s)]
*  time or the accusation of that, to talk about kind of the value for our national security, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=126.68s)]
*  for rule of law, for democracy, and there is a way for Joe Biden to do that on the campaign trail [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=132.68s)]
*  and in speeches. But for now, I expect they will be very quiet. Same with Democrats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=139.32s)]
*  The last thing I will say is the difference now, too, is that the band-aid has been pulled off in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=143.64s)]
*  terms of Republicans and prominent Republicans criticizing the president. Chris Christie ripped [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  that band-aid off. He will, I haven't seen a statement by him yet, but I'm sure he will do [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=154.04s)]
*  that, and I don't know if other will follow, but that will be an interesting thing to watch. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqA9oZ3V-AM&t=169.32s)]
