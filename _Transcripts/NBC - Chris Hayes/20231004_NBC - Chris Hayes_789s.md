# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo)
*  the parties. Look, for the first two years after Joe Biden was elected, the Democrats were in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=0.0s)]
*  majority in the House and the Senate. And look at what we got done. We got the biggest infrastructure [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=5.92s)]
*  package through in forever. We got the biggest climate package through in the history of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=11.68s)]
*  world. We got a 15 percent minimum corporate tax. We got through $35 insulin. We got a cap [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=18.64s)]
*  on what seniors are going to spend on their prescription drugs. We got through [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=26.32s)]
*  getting rid of junk fees. Many of the junk fees out there, we made a good, good start on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=32.56s)]
*  getting rid of student loan debt for over three million people. Stuff that's about the business [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=38.72s)]
*  of governing and trying to make government work better for people. Now the Republicans have been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=44.56s)]
*  in control of just one house in government. And in that year and a half, what have they gotten [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=50.56s)]
*  done? Well, they nearly pushed us over the cliff on not raising the debt ceiling, and they nearly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  shut down the government because they couldn't fund it. In other words, Democrats are here to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=64.16s)]
*  try to govern, to try to make Congress work for people. And the Republican extremists are just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=70.16s)]
*  here to cause as much chaos, as much pain, as humanly possible because they think it's going [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=78.0s)]
*  to help Donald Trump get reelected. You know, you talked about that sort of Democratic trifecta with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=83.84s)]
*  Biden and both houses. The last time there was one, of course, the very busy years of the coming out [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=88.4s)]
*  of the Great Recession, 2009, 2010, one of the signature pieces of legislation then was the Dodd-Frank [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=93.6s)]
*  financial regulation bill. Huge sprawling piece of legislation and contained within it was a new agency [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=100.48s)]
*  that was the brainchild of a law professor named Elizabeth Warren, who was writing about financial [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=105.76s)]
*  regulation and had a famous line saying, you know, if you sold mortgages that blew up as much as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=111.44s)]
*  these mortgages, if you sold them as toasters, you wouldn't be allowed to put them on the shelves [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=116.48s)]
*  because we have a consumer product safety commission that says if the toaster blows up, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  you can't sell it. And that brainchild, a consumer product safety commission for finance, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=124.0s)]
*  for financial regulations, consumer financial protection board, became reality. It is now a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=129.76s)]
*  reality and has been for years. Today, a bunch of payday lenders were before the Supreme Court of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=134.4s)]
*  the United States trying to get rid of it, trying to destroy it by saying it is unconstitutional [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=140.8s)]
*  to have the Financial Protection Bureau that gets its funding, you know, authorized by Congress, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=146.8s)]
*  but through the Federal Reserve. I know this is incredibly near and dear to you. What did you make [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=151.52s)]
*  of today's argument? Well, partly they're still coming after this agency because it works. It [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  has shut down the scams. It's forced the big financial institutions to return more than 17 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=163.36s)]
*  billion dollars to people that were cheated by those institutions. The agency is handling about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=170.4s)]
*  3,000 complaints a day. And so the payday industry, remember, these are the guys [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=177.68s)]
*  who make their profits by preying, for example, on young service members with loans that run [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=184.08s)]
*  as high as 400 percent interest. They have sued the agency and lost, sued the agency and lost, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=190.96s)]
*  sued the agency and lost. And now this is their Hail Mary. They claim that the agency is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  unconstitutional because it's not funded through appropriations. And they say, that's no good. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=206.16s)]
*  Here's the problem, though, with that. It also turns out that the Federal Reserve Bank is not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=212.72s)]
*  funded through appropriations. Neither is the FDIC. Neither is the OCC. In fact, no banking [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=217.68s)]
*  regulator in the history of banking regulators in the United States has ever been funded through [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=224.72s)]
*  appropriations. And it gets worse than that. Turns out Social Security is not funded through [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=232.16s)]
*  appropriations. Medicare is not funded through appropriations. And that was where the Supreme [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=238.32s)]
*  Court went today. The payday lenders said, sink the CFPB. And everybody else in the room was asking, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=244.88s)]
*  but if you sink the CFPB, are you going to sink the whole damned economy? And the answer to that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=254.72s)]
*  question is, yeah, that's the risk you run. And that's what today's debate was all about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's like, I understand why you loan sharks may not like an agency that regulates [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=267.84s)]
*  things like interest. But are we going to mess around and declare the Federal Reserve unconstitutional? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=273.44s)]
*  Which seems dangerous. It just seems like they are treading in very, very dangerous waters with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=278.16s)]
*  this argument, which at least had enough of the sympathetic hearing that it got up to the court. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=282.96s)]
*  But the questions in oral arguments today seem pretty skeptical. Yeah. Yeah. But you know part [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=286.8s)]
*  of what helped that a lot? I just want to give a little shout out here. The mortgage bankers, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=293.6s)]
*  the home builders, folks who actually were involved in the crash back in 2008. And by the way, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=299.36s)]
*  Chris, did you remember that today is an anniversary? Exactly 15 years ago today, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=306.96s)]
*  Congress had to pass a $700 billion bailout to be able to make that money available so that our [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=313.76s)]
*  banking system didn't implode. So what has been the big thank you from those giant banks? It's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=322.0s)]
*  been to keep lobbying to try to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so that they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=329.52s)]
*  could continue to run more and more of these frauds. And today, what people were pushing on [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=335.68s)]
*  the Supreme Court was to say, if you decide that this funding mechanism for the CFPB is unconstitutional, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=342.64s)]
*  you really run this risk of blowing up the whole system. That's when I said, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=352.0s)]
*  even the mortgage brokers said, don't do this. This is dangerous. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=356.08s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you so much for your time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=360.08s)]
*  The trial of Sam Bankman Fried started today. He, of course, the one-time crypto billionaire [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=363.92s)]
*  who became the richest person on earth under 30 in like a matter of 18 months. He was also one [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=368.72s)]
*  of the biggest donors in democratic politics. And he basically had the whole world at his feet. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=374.96s)]
*  President Bill Clinton was on stage with him at a crypto conference. He got athletes like Tom [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=380.24s)]
*  Brady and Steph Curry. And remember comedians like Larry David? Remember to cut that commercial [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=385.12s)]
*  in the Super Bowl for his crypto exchange, FTX? And then the thing went bust, just completely [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  bust. And Sam Bankman Fried was subsequently indicted for conspiracy and fraud by federal [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=395.44s)]
*  prosecutors. If he is convicted, he could face over 100 years in prison. And it's one of the most [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=400.48s)]
*  spectacular rise and fall stories of basically anyone in recent memory. And as it turns out, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=406.32s)]
*  bestselling nonfiction author Michael Lewis was basically just hanging out with Bankman Fried on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=411.92s)]
*  his way up and the way down. His new book about it, Going Infinite, was published today. And joining [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=417.12s)]
*  me now, Michael Lewis, in his first live TV interview about this book. Great to have you here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=423.44s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=426.88s)]
*  It's an incredible read, as all Michael Lewis works are. Before I get into this, let me ask [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=427.52s)]
*  you this question. As someone who's written about finance from Liar's Poker, your first [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=432.08s)]
*  incredible claim book, when I tried to get my head around crypto and kept having this thing of like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=436.4s)]
*  is this a con or is it not? And I kept going back and forth. Is it a con? I talked to some people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=442.88s)]
*  In the end, I kind of was like, didn't quite come down. And then all this blew up. And I was like, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=447.44s)]
*  guess it was a con. Where is your, I mean, independent of him, like this thing that created [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=451.36s)]
*  billions of dollars that was sloshing around the con, trillions of dollars sloshing around the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=457.92s)]
*  economy. Where do you think of it in that trajectory? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=462.48s)]
*  So it's odd because it's kind of both. I mean, I think in the first place, it's a tulip. I mean, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=465.6s)]
*  what we've been through is like a tulip craze. But the technology underneath it, it's real. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=470.0s)]
*  It actually has promise to do things like get rid of financial intermediaries. It's not nothing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  It's maybe overblown. And the thing that's kind of been odd about it is a story. You know, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=483.92s)]
*  it's created in 2008. From 2008 on, it's had a series of sort of narratives it's tried to sell. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=489.44s)]
*  None of the narratives have been true. It's sort of like it's this solution in sorts of a problem. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=496.56s)]
*  That's what it feels like. It's a real thing. There's real tech there. But it's like when the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=501.84s)]
*  tulip, you know, there's famous Dutch tulip craze where people are or beanie babies, right? Like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=506.4s)]
*  when it got real hot and frothy in the market, when this guy's worth 30 billion, it felt like that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=511.04s)]
*  Yes, it did. But so it hasn't, its promise has not been realized. But it's not to say it's just [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=515.68s)]
*  nothing. It's like it does, it could, one day in the future would not be shocking if blockchain is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=522.0s)]
*  used in all of financial transactions. It just hasn't happened yet. And so in between, there are [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=528.88s)]
*  lots of stories that have gotten told that are kind of not true stories. And it's fueled this [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=533.76s)]
*  craze. And to me, the crypto itself wasn't that it wasn't what was interesting. It was the social [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=536.8s)]
*  consequences of $3 trillion being created out of nothing. That really was, I mean, it was so [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=541.44s)]
*  striking if you were even adjacent or even a few nodes away from it. All of a sudden this money's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  just cascading out of this thing. He got a big chunk of it. So this guy, it's a facet. Look, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=551.84s)]
*  he's a strange dude. I mean, in the end, it's like, again, there's sort of this like Bernie [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=559.2s)]
*  Madoff style con man, like benighted strange dude over his head. I feel like I ended up in, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=564.96s)]
*  I had come down in the Bernie Madoff category when I read the indictment. That's not really the line [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=573.6s)]
*  this book takes. What's your impression of it? Well, so just for starters, I mean, this like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=581.44s)]
*  I think this is an important distinction. Everybody shouts at me when I make it, but Bernie Madoff, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=586.64s)]
*  it was a Ponzi scheme and it's like a definition of a Ponzi scheme. There's no real business there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=590.64s)]
*  So Sam Bankman Fried had two businesses. He had this hedge fund he called Alameda Research, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=594.96s)]
*  but he had this crypto exchange and the exchange was a gold mine. It generated a billion dollars [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=600.48s)]
*  in revenues in 2021, like $400 million in profits. It was real. Without the hedge fund there to screw [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=605.36s)]
*  it up, it'd still be there. It was a casino. It was just like they took little slices of every [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=612.32s)]
*  transaction in crypto. And the other one is still around, right? Coinbase or whatever. Yeah, well, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=617.84s)]
*  there are a bunch of them that are still around. So and people, most of them, the most money in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=623.28s)]
*  crypto has been made by people who bought Bitcoin when it was zero or people who created these [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=627.36s)]
*  exchanges. So there was this real thing and the alleged crime kind of makes no sense. He blew up [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=631.52s)]
*  $40 billion, a $40 billion business for this kind of hedge fund on the side. It really was, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=639.6s)]
*  it was his legacy business is how he got into crypto in the first place, but it didn't, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=645.28s)]
*  they didn't bear a necessary relationship. There was a relationship, but it wasn't necessary. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=649.44s)]
*  He could have gotten rid of that thing. Right, but he did seem to take people's money in one [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=654.24s)]
*  and transfer it over to the other. And he did. And he was, you know, I think of him as a creature of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=658.48s)]
*  modern finance. I mean, in any other era in Wall Street, he's probably not on Wall Street, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=663.84s)]
*  but he's pulled out of MIT by high frequency trading firms that identify his mind as exactly [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=668.48s)]
*  the kind of mind that belongs in finance. And, you know, almost any other period in history, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=674.24s)]
*  he's like a high school physics teacher here. He's, he's, he, he, he's kind of imprinted. So [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=679.44s)]
*  I just, and it's, it's sort of like, he gets, he becomes his identity, this trading thing. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=684.4s)]
*  And, and I think he couldn't let go of it. You know, I saw some, there was some Elon Musk in, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=690.48s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, Walter Eisenstein has his Elon Musk biography, but just like, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=696.48s)]
*  you do the compare and contrast. They're different though. Well, they are different, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=699.84s)]
*  but there's something about a certain kind of mind that, that works like a key and a lock of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=702.72s)]
*  a certain kind of set of problems solving, but is not great outside of that domain. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=709.12s)]
*  Right. And maybe to disastrous consequences. So Sam Peck McFreed said, he said, until I hit [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=714.4s)]
*  Wall Street, I didn't think that I was really special at anything. I wasn't good at anything. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=721.36s)]
*  There wasn't anything I was suited for. He hits, he hits Jane street of this high frequency [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=726.0s)]
*  firm. He says, this is what I was put on earth to do. And then what he did is he saw that in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=730.32s)]
*  crypto, there's an even bigger opportunity to do it than in stocks and bonds and currencies. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=734.0s)]
*  So that, that's what gets him going in the first place. So, but it is, so you're, you're watching [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  something that like it only happened now and this phenomenal someone becoming that rich that quickly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=744.24s)]
*  and the way the whole society shapes itself around him, politics, media. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  There are, there are scenes in here of what that looks like. The clustering around when [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  that much money comes in one person that quickly that are like truly gobsmacking. It's called [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=759.28s)]
*  going infinite. It's on sale today. Michael Lewis. Great to have you here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=764.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me. Thank you. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QgRN9jrsHo&t=767.6s)]
