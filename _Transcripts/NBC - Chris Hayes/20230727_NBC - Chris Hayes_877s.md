# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 26
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8)
*  When Joe Biden took office more than two years ago now, he asked nearly all of the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=0.0s)]
*  States attorneys from the Trump era to resign. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=5.12s)]
*  This is a typical process for a new president. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=7.62s)]
*  But Joe Biden went out of his way to leave two, two in particular of those federal prosecutors [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=10.5s)]
*  in place. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=16.48s)]
*  One was John Durham. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=17.54s)]
*  Yes, you've heard a lot about that guy who was conducting a special counsel investigation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=18.54s)]
*  to the origins of the Russia probe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=22.72s)]
*  You may also remember that politically charged investigation basically ended with a whimper. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=24.72s)]
*  And the other was the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, a man named David Weiss [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=30.16s)]
*  we've heard a lot about in recent weeks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  He was investigating Biden's own son. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=36.88s)]
*  That's why he kept him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=39.64s)]
*  Now I remember this well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=41.0s)]
*  I was working on the Biden transition team when these decisions were made and it was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=42.36s)]
*  not exactly the easier option. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=45.96s)]
*  I mean, no one in the Biden orbit knew what either prosecutor would decide to do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  But the point was that the investigative work of the Department of Justice and these attorneys [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  must be independent and it was important to let them finish their work. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=57.44s)]
*  That is how the system is supposed to work. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Well last month, U.S. attorney Weiss brought charges to misdemeanor tax offenses and a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  felony firearm offense. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=68.52s)]
*  All three stem from a time while Hunter Biden was battling drug addiction, something by [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=70.44s)]
*  the way millions of Americans deal with either themselves, family members or others in their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=74.88s)]
*  life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=80.24s)]
*  And he was very open about it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=81.24s)]
*  He wrote a memoir that he published in 2021 and talked all about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=82.24s)]
*  Weiss also announced that he has secured a plea deal where Hunter Biden would plead guilty [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=86.92s)]
*  to the tax charges and enter into what is called a pre-trial diversion agreement on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=91.16s)]
*  the gun charge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=95.44s)]
*  Today, Hunter Biden appeared in federal court for a hearing where he was expected to formally [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=96.76s)]
*  enter that plea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=101.72s)]
*  That's what everybody thought was going to happen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=102.72s)]
*  But in what felt like a twist, the judge did not approve the deal, instead giving the prosecutors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  and defense teams 30 days to hash out the agreement. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=109.84s)]
*  Hunter Biden then pleaded not guilty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=113.48s)]
*  Now while all of this was going on today, President Biden remains pretty out of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  public eye. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=119.4s)]
*  He has maintained a strict distance from any appearance of involvement in his son's case, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  any appearance at all, or the processes of the Department of Justice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  Now, whatever you think of these relatively minor offenses by Hunter Biden, he is someone [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  who does not hold public office, simply happens to be son of the president, and the Biden [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  administration has played this exactly by the book. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=140.12s)]
*  Now, just to put this full picture for you, imagine just for a second that a child of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=144.08s)]
*  the former president, a child of Trump, was under investigation by a prosecutor appointed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  by a Democratic president. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you think there is any world in which he would have let that person keep their job, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=157.0s)]
*  or frankly even refrain from personally attacking them? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=161.28s)]
*  If you have any doubt, remember, Donald Trump attempted to co-opt the Department of Justice [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  to help him steal the election, and he has repeatedly targeted prosecutors for simply [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=169.22s)]
*  doing their jobs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=174.38s)]
*  Yesterday the former president commanded his foot soldiers in Congress to immediately take [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=176.02s)]
*  steps to stop the DOJ from prosecuting him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=179.74s)]
*  Just this morning he was hollering on his Truth Social page about prosecutorial misconduct [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=183.34s)]
*  and predicting he will have the trial of the century. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=187.62s)]
*  So yes, Joe Biden and Donald Trump have starkly different views of the independence of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=191.1s)]
*  Department of Justice, and that's important to remember as we look at history. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=196.78s)]
*  Claire McCaskill served as a Democratic Senator of Missouri, and she joins me now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=201.22s)]
*  Claire, you have a legal background, a political background, and we're all trying to make sense [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=205.18s)]
*  of what happened today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  So let me start with this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Is it unusual for a judge not to accept a plea deal like this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  Because it felt kind of surprising to everybody watching it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=216.3s)]
*  Well, there were some things in this plea deal that were unusual, and that's what the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=219.58s)]
*  judge focused on, both the scope of the immunity, which is not unusual for that to get hashed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=224.3s)]
*  out in detail, but also the fact that what they did in this plea deal, typically if you're [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  on a diversion program, if you violate the terms of the diversion, in this instance, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  either break the law or use drugs or have a gun, then that is handled by people through [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=242.74s)]
*  the Department of Justice, people that are assigned to the diversion program and monitor [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=249.78s)]
*  people who are on diversion. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=254.98s)]
*  They were worried that Trump could get reelected and decide he would revoke Hunter Biden's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=257.22s)]
*  diversion without cause. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=264.5s)]
*  And so they said they wanted to maintain... [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=267.46s)]
*  Yeah, so they wouldn't be able to maintain the parts of the plea if Trump is elected. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=269.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=275.3s)]
*  And so what they did in this case, they said they wanted the judge to be the arbiter as [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=276.41999999999996s)]
*  to whether or not he had violated the terms of diversion. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=280.94s)]
*  And she said, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, that's not my job. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=284.14s)]
*  I am not somebody who is the arbiter of whether someone has violated diversion. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=287.78s)]
*  That's an executive branch function. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=291.5s)]
*  So I think that's the main thing they're going to work out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=293.73999999999995s)]
*  And frankly, they'll probably work out whether or not he's got immunity from FARA, which [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=296.82s)]
*  is the federal lobbying statute. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=300.7s)]
*  I think once those two things get worked out, I think the plea would go forward as had been [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  previously planned. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=309.61999999999995s)]
*  So that's what happens. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=310.94s)]
*  They gave 30 days for them to work it out. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=312.06s)]
*  Is that primarily what happens over the next 30 days? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  And do they reconvene again or what happens next? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=317.02s)]
*  Well, they have to come to an agreement as to the scope of immunity, and they have to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  come up with a way to monitor his diversion that does not involve the judge directly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=325.02s)]
*  And that's what I believe they will spend their time on trying to work out. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=332.06s)]
*  If they can't, then there would be no plea deal. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=336.74s)]
*  He has been charged. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=340.5s)]
*  It would be up to the prosecutors to decide whether to charge him with more cases or to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=341.5s)]
*  go forward on what they had already charged him and have a trial. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=346.02s)]
*  It would be fairly unusual for someone who has paid all of their taxes and penalties [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=349.94s)]
*  to go to trial on a case, on a tax case. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=356.02s)]
*  Typically, if someone pays them all plus penalties, particularly under circumstances [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=359.86s)]
*  where they admit they were impaired with an addiction at the time, that would be unusual [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  to put to a jury. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=369.06s)]
*  You don't know how excited. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=370.66s)]
*  I mean, frankly, the Republicans want to do away with the IRS, so I don't know why they're [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=372.14s)]
*  worried about paying taxes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=375.82s)]
*  They want to make sure nobody pays taxes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=377.38s)]
*  And I don't think Trump somebody used to say anybody who paid taxes was a sucker. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=379.26s)]
*  Well, you gave me a perfect transition to ask you to put your political hat now on, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=383.18s)]
*  because what I'm curious about is what you'll be watching over the next couple of days. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=387.9s)]
*  I mean, Hunter Biden is a favorite target of Republicans in the House, Republicans from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=392.58s)]
*  the Trump wing of the party and others. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=398.82s)]
*  What accusations and arguments do you think they're going to make given this didn't go [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=401.7s)]
*  exactly as planned today? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=405.26s)]
*  Well, they're going to keep doing what they've been doing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=406.86s)]
*  They are going to try to indict a father for loving his son who has been addicted to drugs [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=410.5s)]
*  and or alcohol and without evidence of the father doing anything other than loving that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=416.66s)]
*  son. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  And that, I think, doesn't fly with most of the American people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  It may fly within that small calcified circle of the Trumpers who want to make want to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=428.18s)]
*  believe that somehow Joe Biden was involved in nefarious dealings. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=435.1s)]
*  But there's no evidence. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=439.94000000000005s)]
*  And believe me, if there was evidence, Durham, who was left in place, as you pointed out [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=441.38s)]
*  by President Biden, would have found it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=445.94s)]
*  And certainly Weiss, who was left in place by President Biden, would have found it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=448.06s)]
*  And I do not believe for a minute that either one of those federal prosecutors that had [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=453.46s)]
*  the resources of DOJ at their disposal would have found evidence if it was there that would [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=457.9s)]
*  have shown any problem of Joe Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  So this is a dog that won't hunt. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  And they have selective amnesia, by the way. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=467.62s)]
*  They have selective amnesia. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I can make a very strong argument politically that the only reason Donald Trump [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=471.66s)]
*  is president is because of DOJ and them inappropriately issuing a letter 10 days for the election [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=476.06s)]
*  about Hillary Clinton's emails. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=483.26s)]
*  You wouldn't be the only one who makes who makes that argument. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=484.58s)]
*  Well, a dog that won't hunt. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=489.7s)]
*  I love that phrase. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=491.5s)]
*  Love a good Clara McCaskill ism. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=492.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me with both your political and legal hat on tonight. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=494.3s)]
*  Basically, if people make you believe you're divided, don't accept that you're not divided. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=498.5s)]
*  You wouldn't be sitting here if you were divided. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=506.14s)]
*  It's the politics in Washington, the business of the Democrat and Republican Party that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=507.62s)]
*  has a better model. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=512.18s)]
*  Their business model is better if you're divided. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=513.9s)]
*  And basically they get you all chained up and you're ready to go and nothing gets done. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=516.82s)]
*  So their business model is better to be divided than united. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=521.6s)]
*  And we're going to change that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=525.14s)]
*  That was America's self-described unifier. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, at a town hall in New Hampshire sponsored [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=530.14s)]
*  by No Labels, an organization that is trying to sell itself as nonpartisan. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=535.14s)]
*  Though there are big, huge, gave in questions about who is backing the group since they [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=539.98s)]
*  refuse to disclose their donors and huge holes in their argument that running a third party [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=544.08s)]
*  ticket wouldn't just elect Donald Trump. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=548.58s)]
*  So maybe unity and an end to all division sounds great on paper. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=551.74s)]
*  I mean, more options. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=555.78s)]
*  Tone down the partisanship. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=557.18s)]
*  Can we all just get along? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  It sounds good. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=560.22s)]
*  But as Jamal Bowie argues in the New York Times, this whole notion is a bit of a fantasy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=561.5s)]
*  He writes, quote, there's no way to realize this long running fantasy of politics without [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  partisanship. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=571.3s)]
*  Organized conflict is an unavoidable part of democratically structured political life [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=572.9s)]
*  for the simple reason that politics is about governing and governing is about choices. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=577.18s)]
*  Jamal Bowie, opinion columnist for the New York Times joins me now. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=582.3s)]
*  Now, you started your column with this line that really stuck with me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=585.9s)]
*  For as long as Americans have had partisan political competition, they have hated partisanship [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  itself. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=594.06s)]
*  Or I'm going to add my or so they say. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=595.06s)]
*  But you make the case for the effectiveness of partisanship. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=597.6999999999999s)]
*  So let's hear it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=600.74s)]
*  What's the case? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=602.02s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=603.02s)]
*  I mean, it's not so much that partisanship is effective or ineffective. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=604.02s)]
*  It's just part of life. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=608.62s)]
*  It's an unavoidable part of political life, like I wrote. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=610.02s)]
*  And so the question really isn't, can we have politics without partisanship? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=613.66s)]
*  And the clear answer is no. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=617.74s)]
*  Even during times when partisanship is relatively low, there were still intense partisan competition. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=619.98s)]
*  It comes with the package. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=626.38s)]
*  The question is, does our political system work with the partisanship we have? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=628.04s)]
*  Does it facilitate it? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=632.5799999999999s)]
*  Does it structure it in a useful way? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=634.22s)]
*  Or does our political system make it difficult to operate under conditions of high levels [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=636.62s)]
*  of partisanship? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=640.58s)]
*  Now, I would say that the issue is the latter in that if you want a better politics, you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=641.58s)]
*  actually just need to change the system in which we're working. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=646.62s)]
*  Now, so one of the arguments of changing the system are these candidates who are running [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=650.66s)]
*  for potentially for no labels or in a third party. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=654.98s)]
*  And national polling has captured the appetite for a third party or unity ticket for decades. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=658.26s)]
*  I mean, back in 2016, it was 46% said we needed a third party. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=662.62s)]
*  A poll last week said 47%. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=667.9s)]
*  It's been around for a while. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  But in actual elections with a third party or unity candidate, it typically turns into [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=671.54s)]
*  single digit support. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=676.6s)]
*  Maybe that validates what you're saying in your column. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=679.16s)]
*  But why do you think that is? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=681.28s)]
*  I think it's because typically these third party candidacies aren't really challenging [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=684.18s)]
*  or changing the system at all. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=688.38s)]
*  First of all, it's not clear that voters want some sort of like amorphous unity ticket. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=690.3s)]
*  When voters talk about wanting a third option, they often mean they want something distinct. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=696.26s)]
*  And the thing about a unity ticket is by definition, it isn't distinct. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=701.14s)]
*  But the other thing is that there's no real way to win. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=705.62s)]
*  Given the electoral college, given the fact that you need to kind of structure elections [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=710.5799999999999s)]
*  over the entire country, especially for presidential election, there's no real way for a third [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=715.52s)]
*  party to win. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=721.36s)]
*  And really the only time a third party has actually won or come close to winning in American [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=722.72s)]
*  history is when the other parties collapse, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=727.84s)]
*  The Republican Party emerges out of the collapse of the Whig Party. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  And so it's like the system briefly becomes no longer a two party system and then becomes [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=736.0s)]
*  a two party system again. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=740.16s)]
*  And so you have to actually change kind of the underlying rules of the game to even make [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=741.72s)]
*  a third party viable in any kind of election. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=745.52s)]
*  And then the third parties that are likely going to emerge are going to stand for something [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=748.4s)]
*  specific. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=752.32s)]
*  They're not just going to be a kumbaya party of all sides coming together. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=753.32s)]
*  You make this point also in your column that there's a tendency for those who are advocating [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=758.2s)]
*  for a unity ticket or unifying to kind of lump very different things together. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=762.5400000000001s)]
*  And this really stuck out to me too, like Black Lives Matter and the January 6th right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=766.6s)]
*  Not that they're saying it exactly like that, but they are lumping them together, which [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=771.44s)]
*  clearly feels dangerous. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=774.84s)]
*  Why do you think that that is part of the argument? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=777.48s)]
*  Or do you think that they're just, they don't think of it that way? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=780.36s)]
*  I mean, my sense is that they think of it as they're positing the two extremes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=785.24s)]
*  And Senator Manchin in during the town hall, this is the terms in which he talks about [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=789.32s)]
*  it, that there are these two extreme sides. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=792.88s)]
*  And I mean, those extremes aren't the equivalent at all. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=796.12s)]
*  But I think that's how the people making the argument imagine it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=800.36s)]
*  And I guess what I would say is that, again, there's actually nothing really wrong with [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=803.4s)]
*  people having extreme views. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=808.08s)]
*  There's nothing necessarily wrong with people having views that are outside of the mainstream. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=811.1600000000001s)]
*  The question is, to what extent do we want those views to be represented in our politics? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=816.28s)]
*  And if we want them represented at all, and I think it's an open question, some people [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=820.84s)]
*  do, some people don't, then you have to actually look at the structure of how you create political [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=824.88s)]
*  competition in the country right now, because of our single member districts, because of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=829.76s)]
*  our first past the post elections. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=835.84s)]
*  Everything's set up to create two dominant parties. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be that way. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's really, I think for people who want another option, that's how they should [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=843.68s)]
*  be thinking, not can we create a third party presidential campaign? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=847.48s)]
*  But what are the rules of the game? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  And how do you change them to facilitate competition? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkuWtVJb_m8&t=853.16s)]
