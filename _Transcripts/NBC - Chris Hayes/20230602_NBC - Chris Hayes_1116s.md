# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w)
*  Fonce on the right to their leading candidate being indicted and simultaneously criminally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=0.0s)]
*  investigated on the federal and state level has been to throw everything they have into [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=4.32s)]
*  investigating anyone with the last name Biden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=8.8s)]
*  The Oversight Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman James Comer, spent roughly the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=12.56s)]
*  last five months launching investigation after investigation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=16.88s)]
*  When they finally released their first report last month, here is the New York Times headline [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=20.96s)]
*  about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=25.66s)]
*  Quote, House Republican report finds no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=26.66s)]
*  Not the headline they're going for. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=30.82s)]
*  But Republicans have soldiered on trying to find any evidence of anything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=32.58s)]
*  And now they are threatening to hold FBI Director Chris Wray in contempt of Congress for not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  blindly handing over a confidential document that includes unsubstantiated claims from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=41.7s)]
*  a so-called informant about Biden and his family. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=47.58s)]
*  Republicans can't even find this star informant. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  No, seriously. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=53.82s)]
*  They are saying the informant himself, the person who made the accusations, is missing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=54.82s)]
*  So instead they want the FBI to publicly release whatever unsubstantiated claims are in that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=59.38s)]
*  document. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=64.34s)]
*  People who have actually read the document, like Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, readily [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=65.82s)]
*  admit that Republicans really just don't care if these wild claims are true or not. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=69.54s)]
*  We aren't interested in whether or not the accusations against Vice President Biden are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  accurate or not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=83.58s)]
*  Senator, how damning is this document to the sitting U.S. president? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=84.58s)]
*  Well it's, I don't know that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=89.66s)]
*  And that's what we need to know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=93.14s)]
*  But you've read it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=94.14s)]
*  I read it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=95.94s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=96.94s)]
*  There's accusations in it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=97.94s)]
*  Even over at Fox News, they are quite frustrated that Republicans have not been able to show [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=102.66s)]
*  the receipts. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=106.74s)]
*  It really is disheartening to see all of the oversight that you all are trying to do, whether [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=109.38s)]
*  it's IRS, whether it's FBI, DOJ, and just having very little luck, frankly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=116.82s)]
*  The most telling comment came from the oversight chairman himself. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=123.58s)]
*  He went on Fox News shortly after 4 a.m. last week and was asked if his investigation has [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=126.22s)]
*  moved the needle in the upcoming presidential election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  You look at the polling and right now Donald Trump is seven points ahead of Joe Biden and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=134.46s)]
*  trending upward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=140.3s)]
*  Joe Biden's trending downward. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=141.3s)]
*  And I believe that the media is looking around scratching their head and they're realizing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=143.38s)]
*  that the American people are keeping up with our investigation and they realize something's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=147.24s)]
*  wrong here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=151.34s)]
*  Republicans including the head of their investigation are, in that clip, nakedly admitting what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  is obvious to everyone, which is this is just like Benghazi before it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  It is a blatant political attempt to bring down Biden's numbers, even to the obvious [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=160.18s)]
*  frustration of the people most invested in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=165.3s)]
*  Jackie El-Nani has been reporting on the investigation for The Washington Post and she joins me now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=168.62s)]
*  Jackie, I kept thinking I was missing something here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  So I was like seeing reports about it and then I went back and sort of read in. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  There is some document somewhere in the FBI where some person said the president, Vice [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=182.22s)]
*  President Joe Biden, six or seven years ago was taking bribes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=191.78s)]
*  That's exactly right, Chris. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=194.22s)]
*  There are a lot of different rabbit holes to go down when it comes to trying to piece [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=196.18s)]
*  through all of House GOP Republicans, different allegations of whistleblowers because lawmakers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=200.06s)]
*  like James Comer and Jim Jordan have pinned the success of their investigations to in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=205.86s)]
*  order to paint the Biden administration and his family as corrupt and the federal government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  as a political tool on these allegations, whether or not they're credible. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=217.66s)]
*  But this allegation in particular, this showdown with Christopher Wray, which only really lends [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=222.18s)]
*  Comer more credibility than he has substantiated or verified is over this FD 1023 form. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=228.86s)]
*  And this is an informant that has given unverified, unsubstantiated allegations to the FBI that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=237.82s)]
*  Comer and Chuck Grassley have been demanding that Christopher Wray turn over even though [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=246.78s)]
*  they've already reviewed this document. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=252.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=254.98s)]
*  I mean, so the idea is that like somewhere in the government, there's some informant who [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=255.5s)]
*  at some point told the FBI like the vice president's taking bribes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=259.22s)]
*  Now, I don't know, maybe the vice president was taking bribes and like no one knew about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=263.14s)]
*  it and the whole thing was covered up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=266.94s)]
*  Or maybe this informant didn't know what he's talking about. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=268.5s)]
*  You could choose. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=271.74s)]
*  But this is this is what the FBI said to you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=272.70000000000005s)]
*  An FD 1023 form is used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting by a confidential human [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=275.38000000000005s)]
*  source documenting the information, does not validate it, establish its credibility or [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=282.74s)]
*  weigh it against other information verified by the FBI. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, between that statement and the way Chuck Grassley responded, I'm not getting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=290.54s)]
*  the vibe from anyone involved in this document that they're giving it much credibility. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  It's just a useful narrative device for the investigation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=300.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=305.3s)]
*  This is the these are the exact headlines that James Comer wants, especially as he sort [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=306.3s)]
*  of simultaneously struggled to actually present any substantive evidence that directly ties [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=311.5s)]
*  Joe Biden to some of the evidence that they have been able to scrounge up that have at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=316.86s)]
*  least raised questions about the Biden family's business dealings. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=321.74s)]
*  But Christopher Ray did offer directly an extraordinary accommodation to Grassley and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=325.98s)]
*  James Comer this week in a phone call. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=332.86s)]
*  He said that they could come in in person and review a redacted version of the document. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=334.94s)]
*  They just couldn't take it home with them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=340.1s)]
*  Comer has said that this is insufficient, that they need the production of the document so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=342.26s)]
*  they can continue to analyze it more thoroughly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=346.02s)]
*  Of course, there's myriad reasons why the FBI has said that they can't actually produce [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=349.34s)]
*  this document. But either way, James Comer is able to at least muddy the waters by [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=354.78s)]
*  all of us having this conversation about these unverified claims. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=360.78s)]
*  It's perfect. It's just, again, the MacGuffin is a Hitchcock term for a plot device of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=365.46s)]
*  some sort of, you know, hidden thing that you're looking for. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=369.7s)]
*  The suitcase in Pulp Fiction being a great example. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=372.38s)]
*  This is Comer's MacGuffin. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  At some point, we'll find out whether it's true or not. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  I think I know which way I would bet if forced to. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Jackie Alamani, thank you very much. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=381.85999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=383.97999999999996s)]
*  Negotiated behind closed doors like the one that came together in the debt ceiling this week is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=387.7s)]
*  going to have some ugly parts. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=391.5s)]
*  In these types of situations, the ugly tends to flow from powerful Washington lobbyists who will [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=393.26s)]
*  take any opportunity to push their own interests. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=398.14s)]
*  This debt deal is no exception. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  The lobbyist in question is this man, Lance West, vice president of federal government [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=403.46s)]
*  relations for the American Petroleum Institute. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=408.7s)]
*  To be clear, that's just the oil and gas industry. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=412.06s)]
*  Lance West landed that job as fossil fuels chief lobbyist after serving for two years as [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=414.98s)]
*  chief of staff to Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=420.14s)]
*  Manchin, of course, a great friend of the oil and gas industry. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=423.54s)]
*  When he first ran for office in 2010, he cut a campaign ad in which he literally shot a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=426.74s)]
*  climate bill. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=432.1s)]
*  I'm Joe Manchin. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=434.3s)]
*  I approve this ad because I'll always defend West Virginia. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  I sue DPA and I'll take dead aim at the cap and trade bill. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=438.66s)]
*  Because it's bad for West Virginia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=445.42s)]
*  Now, he got elected and Manchin has not always lived up to that anti-climate tough guy schtick [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=447.82s)]
*  to his great and enduring historical credit. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=452.42s)]
*  He cast the deciding vote for the Inflation Reduction Act last year, the single largest [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=455.46s)]
*  investment in climate and clean energy in American history. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=459.82s)]
*  We did want something in return. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=463.26s)]
*  He wanted to fast track a controversial natural gas pipeline set to run 300 miles through [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  West Virginia and Virginia. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=470.62s)]
*  Completion of the so-called Mountain Valley pipeline has been held up in the courts with [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=472.74s)]
*  concerns about environmental damage on national lands and waterways. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  Also, opposition to the pipeline has not only come from folks concerned about the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=481.42s)]
*  environment. As Virginia Center Tim Kaine notes, hundreds of his constituents are having [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=484.86s)]
*  their land taken away to construct the pipeline. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=489.94000000000005s)]
*  Senator Kaine also opposes the project. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  So you've got an unpopular pipeline project promised to a West Virginia senator whose [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  former chief of staff is now a top oil and gas lobbyist. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=499.14000000000004s)]
*  You will never guess which pet project made its way to the debt ceiling bill. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  And get this, not just expedited approval from the Mountain Valley pipeline, but an [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=507.1s)]
*  extraordinary move, as NPR puts it, to quash lawsuits against the pipeline project and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=510.82000000000005s)]
*  send any new appeals to the D.C. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=516.5s)]
*  Circuit rather than the Fourth Circuit, which has regional jurisdiction and which has [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=518.74s)]
*  blocked numerous permits. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=523.42s)]
*  Basically, provisions in this bill will eliminate the arduous process of getting permits [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=525.86s)]
*  to build the pipeline and federal land. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=530.4599999999999s)]
*  It will hasten completion of the whole thing, wrap it up in a bow to whiz through Congress, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=532.3s)]
*  be signed by the president before the deadline to raise the debt ceiling next week. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's not even the worst thing about it, because during the negotiations about the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=541.3399999999999s)]
*  debt deal, there was talk of this grand bargain on what came to be known as permitting [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=544.78s)]
*  reform. The idea was to overhaul the national permitting process for big energy [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=548.3s)]
*  projects, crucially both fossil fuel projects and clean energy projects. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=553.54s)]
*  The idea was that you could make it easier for everyone to get through federal red tape, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=558.42s)]
*  particularly as lots of green energy infrastructure needs to be built out in the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=562.86s)]
*  coming years. This is particularly urgent for new transmission lines, which are very [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=568.42s)]
*  hard to get built, even though we are going to need a ton of them to connect the new [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=574.06s)]
*  carbon free energy we're building to the grid. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=578.6199999999999s)]
*  But all that ended up in the deal for the clean energy is, get this, a study on [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=581.66s)]
*  transmission lines, a study. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  Manchin gets a pipeline, the earth gets a study. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=589.66s)]
*  That tells you what the whole conversation was really about. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=592.8199999999999s)]
*  As Lance West, vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, articulated, quote, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm just a man on a lobbying job like any other. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=600.34s)]
*  I meet with everybody about permitting reform. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=602.66s)]
*  Well, now I guess we know what permitting reform actually means. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=605.62s)]
*  One way of looking at the debt ceiling deal the House approved yesterday, which the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  Senate is expected to vote on as early as tonight, is that one of the biggest possible [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=616.58s)]
*  threats, both an economic threat to the country and a political threat to the Biden [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=621.38s)]
*  presidency, is about to be removed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=624.78s)]
*  The process that got us there was maddening and totally unnecessary. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=627.78s)]
*  Right now, we have an economy that appears to be showing incredible resilience, inflation [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=631.58s)]
*  coming down, the worst of a possible banking crisis, apparently and hopefully behind us. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=635.94s)]
*  Although we'll know more after the May jobs report tomorrow, the latest numbers showed [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=640.98s)]
*  unemployment tied for the lowest rate in decades, with wages and benefits up, crucially. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=644.5400000000001s)]
*  The last thing the country needed was a self-induced black swan event where we [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=650.5400000000001s)]
*  defaulted for the first time in American history. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  Now looks like that's not going to happen, which is an enormous deal from the perspective [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=657.46s)]
*  of the Biden administration's chief goal to get an economy that is working on all [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=661.5400000000001s)]
*  cylinders as we come out of a devastating global pandemic. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=666.02s)]
*  Ron Klain served as the White House chief of staff during the first two years of the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=669.38s)]
*  Biden administration as it fought to dig us out from the effects of COVID. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=672.26s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=675.7s)]
*  Ron, it's great to have you. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=677.3000000000001s)]
*  It's great to be here, Chris. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=679.22s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=680.1s)]
*  What were you thinking as someone who spent a lot of time in that White House and worked [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=680.3000000000001s)]
*  with the Senate and the House when you weren't doing kind of opposition party [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=684.38s)]
*  negotiations about how this deal came together? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=689.62s)]
*  Well, I think, look, I think, as you said, the hostage, which was the U.S. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=694.3s)]
*  economy, was spared. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=699.3s)]
*  And I think that's a win for the American people. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=700.98s)]
*  I think that, you know, there was no way to do this without getting the House to pass [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=703.66s)]
*  it. There was no way to get it on the floor of the House without the Speaker being [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=707.98s)]
*  willing to put on the floor. And so there had to be concessions to him. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=711.3s)]
*  And that's just the result of the 2022 elections. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=715.38s)]
*  But, you know, as you said, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years in this [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=718.5s)]
*  country, the lowest black unemployment rate in the history of this country. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, people at the bottom starting to make a little more money, starting to close [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=726.06s)]
*  the gap between prices and their wages, starting to see inflation come down. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=729.42s)]
*  Price of gas is down more than a dollar from a year ago. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=733.26s)]
*  So, you know, the economy is gaining traction. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=736.02s)]
*  We're seeing growth. There's been talk about recession for months. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=738.02s)]
*  You turn on CNBC, all you hear about is people predicting recessions. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  If the economy is not in recession, there are very strong jobs market up and down the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=744.66s)]
*  scale. And a lot of people have been left behind before. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=749.2199999999999s)]
*  The last thing we needed was to blow that all up with a default that would throw [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=752.54s)]
*  markets into turmoil and would cost experts say at least a million jobs the first two [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=756.0999999999999s)]
*  weeks of the default. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=761.66s)]
*  And so sparing those people their jobs, sparing the economy, that's good for the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=763.02s)]
*  country as a whole. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=767.78s)]
*  There's some interesting sort of color on this that about the approach here, a few [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=769.54s)]
*  things. One, that Mitch McConnell advised to get shrink the room, that it should [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=776.06s)]
*  just basically be Biden and McCarthy. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=781.02s)]
*  And also the White House officials sought to downplay what they privately consider to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=783.3399999999999s)]
*  be substantial victory. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=786.98s)]
*  Headline from Politico just don't boast how Biden world sought to ace the debt [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=788.74s)]
*  ceiling standoff. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=792.5s)]
*  It is interesting to me that this president, there's a lot of times people will urge [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  this president to use the bully pulpit and he doesn't use it in a way that strikes me [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=799.78s)]
*  as a strategic choice, whether it's the correct choice or not. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=803.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=806.46s)]
*  You know, I think there's difference between not using the bullet pulpit and gloating [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=808.1s)]
*  about a deal. The president did, I think, speak quite forcefully about the need. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=811.5s)]
*  If you're serious about reducing the deficit, serious about reducing the debt, we need [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=815.58s)]
*  to really work on revenues. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=818.7s)]
*  And he talked about that repeatedly in the spring and early summer this year about his [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  plans to repeal some of the Trump tax cuts for the richest people in the country, but [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=824.74s)]
*  his plan to have a tax on billionaires. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  And the Republicans made it very clear they were not going to go for any taxes. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=832.26s)]
*  They were going to protect billionaires at all costs. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  And so he couldn't get that done in any kind of negotiation with House Republicans. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=838.74s)]
*  And I think he was forceful on that, but they just wouldn't go there, just like the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=843.66s)]
*  president wouldn't. No matter what McCarthy said, the president wouldn't cut Social [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=846.54s)]
*  Security. The president wouldn't cut Medicare, wouldn't cut Medicaid. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=849.5799999999999s)]
*  The president wasn't going to give up his student loan relief plan. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=852.18s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that each side had some red lines. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=856.06s)]
*  The Republicans would move off their red lines. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=861.02s)]
*  The president didn't move off his red lines. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=863.06s)]
*  As a result, we got a deal that, you know, basically [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=864.98s)]
*  avoids the default and doesn't do that much harm to our economic growth. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=870.3399999999999s)]
*  If I'm in the White House right now on the domestic policy front, not on the international [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=876.02s)]
*  policy, the domestic policy front, the thing that I'm looking at from a political and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=879.98s)]
*  substantive perspective, because I think the incentives are aligned. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=884.9s)]
*  Right. Well, it's good for the country. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=888.38s)]
*  It will be good for the president politically. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=890.14s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=891.7s)]
*  Is the economy right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=892.9s)]
*  And I'm just curious how you think that's true, because you're sitting on that Weiss is [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=895.58s)]
*  like you can't really control whether the Fed hikes rates. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=898.7s)]
*  You can't really like what you could do. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=901.58s)]
*  You've done right. You've avoided some big catastrophe or the debt ceiling deal. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=904.38s)]
*  You've done all the fiscal stimulus, the AARP. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=907.7s)]
*  You've done all these. Now you just got to sit there and hope we get a soft landing, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=909.98s)]
*  basically, which is going to decide the fate of both millions of Americans and the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=913.46s)]
*  president's political fate. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=917.58s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=918.78s)]
*  I don't agree, Chris. It's not just sitting and watching the president pass major [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=919.86s)]
*  legislation in 2022. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  What they have to do this year is start to implement it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=924.54s)]
*  So we got the infrastructure bill. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=927.74s)]
*  Seven thousand projects started last year. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=929.6600000000001s)]
*  There are more than twenty thousand projects starting this year. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=933.58s)]
*  They'll create jobs and long term economic growth. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=933.9000000000001s)]
*  The Chips and Science Act, which is creating manufacturing jobs that provide six [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=936.02s)]
*  figure incomes to people even if they don't have a four year college degree. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=939.98s)]
*  It's going to change this country. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=943.5s)]
*  It's going to make us lose our dependence on foreign ships and take control of our [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=944.58s)]
*  own supply of these critical aspects of modern manufacturing and our high tech [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=948.5400000000001s)]
*  economy. Create a lot of great jobs. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=953.7800000000001s)]
*  So, you know, they've got to get all these things going this year. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=955.98s)]
*  Those things will have impact on the economy and will, you know, make the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=958.86s)]
*  president's legacy, president's achievements concrete to people. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=963.3s)]
*  They know we pass some bills. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=966.22s)]
*  They don't really know what they mean or what they'll do for them. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=967.58s)]
*  This year is the year where you're going to start to see these things happen and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=970.02s)]
*  it will become much more concrete to people. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=973.46s)]
*  And already we're seeing the results of the Inflation Reduction Act with a massive [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=975.5s)]
*  expansion of solar projects, wind projects, the construction of electric [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=979.0600000000001s)]
*  battery factories in the country, all over the country. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=982.9000000000001s)]
*  We are moving high dramatically on the creation of solar and wind and renewable [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=987.38s)]
*  power and on the advancement of the U.S. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=991.46s)]
*  as a leader in electric vehicles. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=993.7800000000001s)]
*  Final question. I've asked you this before the president today. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  We have a speech with the believe it was the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=998.7s)]
*  He tripped. You may have seen the footage literally over a sandbag that was somehow [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1003.5s)]
*  placed behind him, literally sandbagged. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  It seemed to me, honestly, the kind of thing that would happen to anyone in that [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1009.54s)]
*  situation. But of course, you've already got people talking about the president's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1012.54s)]
*  age, concerns about his age. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1015.86s)]
*  I know that you've worked with him. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  His age is immutable, which is what makes it such a convenient attack, I think, for [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1019.26s)]
*  people that don't want to be president because like there's no rebutting it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  But what do you say to people who are concerned? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1026.1s)]
*  I say look at the results that this president is producing. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1029.5s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act is a climate change bill. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1032.66s)]
*  It's the most significant one passed on planet Earth. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1034.46s)]
*  We were unable to do anything on climate change for decades in this country, and now [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1036.74s)]
*  we've passed this legislation. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1040.1s)]
*  Look at the results he's produced in terms of low unemployment and bringing inflation [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1041.58s)]
*  down, getting us past the pandemic, getting businesses back open, getting schools back [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1045.8999999999999s)]
*  to open. The measure of this president is the results he produces every single day. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1050.34s)]
*  And avoiding this dangerous default was the latest of those results. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1054.26s)]
*  So you can judge the president by the results he's producing as president. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1057.82s)]
*  I can tell you he is mentally sharp. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1061.58s)]
*  He is physically fit. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1062.98s)]
*  He, you know, obviously they put sandbags on the stage to hold things down because it [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1064.7s)]
*  was windy. And he tripped over a little sandbags as he was jogging across the stage to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1068.02s)]
*  greet some guests after he'd stood for hours and shook hands and saluted every single [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1072.06s)]
*  graduate of the Air Force Academy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1076.34s)]
*  He is robust. He's robust mentally. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1078.02s)]
*  He's robust physically. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1079.74s)]
*  And what happened today could have happened to anyone who was up there moving across [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1081.6200000000001s)]
*  that stage. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1085.66s)]
*  I should note he also pardoned any of the disciplinary infractions from that class as [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1086.74s)]
*  well, which I think some were pretty happy about wrong claim. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1091.46s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L-aE3LA1w&t=1094.3000000000002s)]
