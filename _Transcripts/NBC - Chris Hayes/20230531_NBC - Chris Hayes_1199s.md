# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 30
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc)
*  I'm joined now by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Congressman, first let me just ask you your sort of top line understanding of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=4.0s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, good evening, Chris. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=13.84s)]
*  I think President Biden accomplished three very important objectives. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=14.84s)]
*  First to make sure that we avoided a devastating and catastrophic default and stopped the extreme [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=18.76s)]
*  mega Republicans from crashing the economy, triggering a job killing recession, which [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=24.8s)]
*  would have hurt millions and millions of everyday Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  The second thing that was accomplished here is to make sure that the debt ceiling was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=34.24s)]
*  suspended for two years, taking it into the early part of 2025 and removing their ability [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=38.4s)]
*  for the balance of this Congress to take the country down another hostage taking exercise. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=47.32s)]
*  Third, President Biden was able to protect some really important Democratic priorities, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=54.0s)]
*  protect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect Medicaid, protect veterans, protect [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  the country from the types of extreme right wing cuts that the Republicans were demanding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=65.16s)]
*  in the bill that they passed in April, the Default on America Act, 22% cuts they were [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=71.16s)]
*  proposing across the board. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And so I think on balance in this circumstance, where he was dealing with an extreme, unreasonable [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=79.14s)]
*  group of people who were determined to bring about a bad result for the American people, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=85.08s)]
*  that President Biden did an incredibly good job in a very difficult situation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=91.66s)]
*  Let's talk about the sort of hostage shaking aspect of this, because there's a sort of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=97.9s)]
*  critiques of the substance of the bill and then there's the critiques of essentially [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=101.22s)]
*  incentivizing this again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=105.38s)]
*  So we saw in 2011, they did it again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=106.62s)]
*  It's now pushed through to 2025, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=108.8s)]
*  The next time they'll have to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=111.44s)]
*  You'll now let's say you have a President Biden in a Republican Congress again. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=112.96s)]
*  Not a crazy idea, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=116.08s)]
*  It's like, okay, we're going to go through this every time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=117.8s)]
*  Has it changed anyone's thinking among your House colleagues that you have to get rid [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=121.08s)]
*  of this thing once and for all, whether it's to do what Gephardt did when he was a Democratic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  leader and essentially come together and just get rid of it statutorily, whether the White [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=129.04s)]
*  House has to look into saying, look, the Constitution doesn't allow us not to pay our debts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=132.8s)]
*  But where are you on that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=136.98s)]
*  Because that seems to me still the kind of unfinished business of this deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=138.48s)]
*  Yes, I think very good point, Chris. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=142.78s)]
*  It's an all of the above approach. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=146.5s)]
*  First thing that we have to do is get through this moment, make sure the country pays our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  bills, avoid a default, and we can continue to build an economy that works for everyday [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=152.92s)]
*  Americans building upon the great record of accomplishment that came out of the last Congress. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=157.26s)]
*  But we also have to find our way out of enabling extreme right-wing individuals in the Congress [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=162.76s)]
*  to use the debt ceiling down the road to take us down this hostage-taking exercise and try [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=171.0s)]
*  to extract a painful ransom. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  And so we need to look at the options legislatively. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=179.14s)]
*  I think that would be the best solution that's in front of us and to see where the opportunities [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  are moving forward. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=187.16s)]
*  McConnell had agreed on a proposal initially several years ago that would change the formula [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=188.84s)]
*  related to the debt ceiling and effectively give the administration through the Secretary [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=195.62s)]
*  of Treasury the ability and presumption to be able to do this without Congress being [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=200.3s)]
*  able to weigh in at the front end. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=206.62s)]
*  So I think we need to look at that because it's a proposal that the Senate Republicans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=208.94s)]
*  have at least supported in the past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=213.18s)]
*  Because then the administration can explore some of the options that may be available [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=215.32s)]
*  to it outside of the context of the crisis that we're in right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=219.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=223.1s)]
*  I'd forgotten the McConnell proposal was basically it defaults to it being raised. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=224.1s)]
*  And if you want to stop it from being raised, then you have to act to pass legislation as [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=228.16s)]
*  opposed to the way that we have it now, which is, as you said, perfectly sets up this sort [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=232.64s)]
*  of this hostage negotiation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  In terms of the process, how involved, I mean, who cut this deal and how involved were you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=239.16s)]
*  Well, President Biden and his team had the laboring oar, but they were in close communication [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  with Leader Schumer and with myself and House Democrats every step of the way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=251.5s)]
*  And I greatly appreciate that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=256.74s)]
*  And House Democrats were unified. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=258.58s)]
*  We were unified in getting behind the discharge petition to make it clear that there was an [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=259.86s)]
*  option here if we couldn't find an acceptable resolution. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=265.9s)]
*  We were unified in all voting against the House Republican Extreme Default on America Act, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  making it clear that there was no room, no leverage in terms of trying to peel off Democrats, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=276.44s)]
*  so that we all stood strongly behind President Biden and his team in avoiding default and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=282.64s)]
*  arriving at a resolution that protected our values and that was acceptable to Democrats [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=288.52s)]
*  in the House and in the Senate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=294.28s)]
*  I want to play you what, when the deal was coming together, Congressman Matt Gaetz, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=295.94s)]
*  I think late last week when the sort of contours were being public, sort of offered a prediction [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  about how he thought this would go. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=304.7s)]
*  And I thought it looks like it's fairly astute, and I'm curious to get your reaction. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=306.5s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=310.3s)]
*  I think that it will pass with about 80 to 100 Democrat votes and between 140 and 160 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=312.38s)]
*  Republican votes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=320.14s)]
*  I think the coalition opposed to this will be like the Squad and the Freedom Caucus, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=321.6s)]
*  and it will rocket through the Senate after it passes the House. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=329.6s)]
*  And I think that there is no serious threat to McCarthy's speakership. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=334.64s)]
*  Basically, a pass on a bipartisan basis. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=338.6s)]
*  I guess the question for you is, are you whipping votes for this? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=343.28s)]
*  Is this a vote that you're going to go around and really get Democrats to vote yes on? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=346.84s)]
*  Well, we're continuing the process of engaging with the administration and making sure that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=352.18s)]
*  they are presenting information, which they have been doing in a very clear and comprehensive [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=355.94s)]
*  way, to members as it relates to the contours, the four corners of the resolution. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=360.74s)]
*  And we'll be hearing from them tomorrow in person at a caucus meeting. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  But I do expect that Democrats will make sure that we don't default and that this agreement [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=371.38s)]
*  that is presented is able to pass out of the House through the Senate and gets to President [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=377.0s)]
*  Biden's desk. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=382.0s)]
*  But it's important for House Republicans to produce at least 150 votes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=383.72s)]
*  This is an agreement that they themselves negotiated. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=389.22s)]
*  And they should be able to produce the votes necessary, consistent with what Representative [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=393.12s)]
*  Gates said, in order to help get this thing over the finish line. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=397.72s)]
*  That's interesting because those two parts of the answers are somewhat in tension with [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=401.48s)]
*  them, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=404.72s)]
*  Look, we, you know, the leadership in the White House, the White House that we generally [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  trust thinks it's a good deal. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=409.18s)]
*  They're explaining why they think it's a good deal, why a membership vote. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=410.5s)]
*  But then the second part is, Kevin, buddy, you negotiated this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  This is what you're doing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  We can't give you, you got to do the heavy lifting on these votes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=419.22s)]
*  Well, he's got to do his part to avoid a default. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=422.66s)]
*  But I do think that for the reasons that I outline and the protection of those democratic [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=427.1s)]
*  values, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, you know, vulnerable individuals, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=432.72s)]
*  the homeless, people who are aging out of foster care, these are all communities and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=436.68s)]
*  issues that we fight hard for as Democrats. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=441.68s)]
*  They're President Biden protected. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=444.32s)]
*  But at the same time, if we're going to have a bipartisan resolution to this, that means [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=445.64s)]
*  that in addition to House Democrats helping to avoid a default, that's exactly what House [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=451.16s)]
*  Republicans should do as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=456.48s)]
*  All right, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, I appreciate you taking some time with us tonight. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=462.16s)]
*  One of the things that I hear some of you guys saying is, why doesn't Biden say what [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  a good deal it is? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=471.38000000000005s)]
*  Why would Biden say what a good deal is before the vote? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=472.38000000000005s)]
*  You think that's going to help me get a pass? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=475.38000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=478.38s)]
*  That's why you guys don't bargain very well. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=479.38s)]
*  President Biden took a small victory lap yesterday after securing a deal to raise a debt ceiling. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=482.38s)]
*  But as you just heard him mention there, it's probably beneficial to not draw much attention [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=487.98s)]
*  to it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=492.42s)]
*  You see, there's been this strange feature of the Biden presidency where he intentionally, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=493.42s)]
*  I think, doesn't command attention or really wield the bully pulpit like either of his [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=498.24s)]
*  two predecessors did. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=502.8s)]
*  It was actually a core premise of Biden's pitch back in the 2020 campaign, I think, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  both in the primary and the general election. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=509.48s)]
*  President Biden promised a return to normalcy after the in-your-face, torturously attention-seeking [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=511.52s)]
*  presidency of Donald Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  I think most people believed Biden could accomplish that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  There's another pillar of his candidacy, too, that was a little more difficult to envision. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=523.54s)]
*  Biden pledged to return the country to a bygone era of partisan dealmaking, the kind of which [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=528.5s)]
*  he spent decades negotiating in the Senate. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=534.38s)]
*  I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were to run for president, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=538.98s)]
*  I like Republicans. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, well, bless me, Father, if I have sinned. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, from where I come from, I don't know how you get anything done. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=550.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know how you get anything done until we start talking to one another again. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=561.14s)]
*  Now, I have to say, personally, I was pretty skeptical of that line. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=564.78s)]
*  But it's true that Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=570.54s)]
*  Reduction Act, were passed along party lines in face Republican opposition. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=575.22s)]
*  Those were progressive priorities, and they didn't get a single Republican vote, at least [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=579.92s)]
*  not in the Senate. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=583.42s)]
*  If you check the larger legislative record, however, the president has quietly, or not [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=584.88s)]
*  so quietly, racked up quite a few bipartisan accomplishments. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=590.42s)]
*  In addition to this latest deal, which it looks like will pass, Biden also signed the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=594.08s)]
*  CHIPS bill, which invests in American tech manufacturing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  There's the bipartisan infrastructure bill to spend money and invest in roads and bridges, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=601.44s)]
*  broadband, lead pipe replacement, among other projects. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=606.24s)]
*  There's the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation to pass Congress in nearly [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=609.84s)]
*  three decades. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  There's the legal codification of gay marriage, all of which got the requisite votes to overcome [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=615.6s)]
*  a Republican filibuster, bipartisan bills. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=620.12s)]
*  Now, listen, most of those bills are, in my opinion, far from perfect. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=623.04s)]
*  Republican negotiators specifically and some Democrats made them all meaningfully worse [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=628.16s)]
*  in some way. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=632.16s)]
*  But they're still tangible legislative accomplishments. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=633.88s)]
*  And crucially, they, again, from a kind of political perspective, they all fall in the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  zone of normal politics in a way that, say, storming the Capitol doesn't. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=640.16s)]
*  So I really do think it is fair to say that Biden has delivered in many respects on those [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  two key promises of his campaign, this sort of return to normalcy and return to a president [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=651.0s)]
*  who doesn't sort of torture you by commanding your attention every day. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=656.96s)]
*  Now, with that in mind, he faces major hurdles in his 2024 reelection campaign. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=661.6s)]
*  The first is his age. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=666.8s)]
*  If he wins the second term, President Biden will be 86 years old by the time he leaves [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=668.32s)]
*  office. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=671.52s)]
*  Frankly, there's nothing he or anyone else can do about that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=672.52s)]
*  It just quite literally is what it is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=675.4s)]
*  But the other major obstacles Biden faces over the next 18 months stem from the fact [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=678.56s)]
*  that he took over a country reeling from a series of cascading crises in the aftermath [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=683.4s)]
*  of the covid pandemic. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=688.0s)]
*  I mean, there really have been just enormously painful dislocations to all of American life [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=689.0s)]
*  under his watch. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  The two most obvious examples are violent crime, which went up quite a bit both in 2020 [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  and inflation, which hit the highest level in 40 years last year and ate into people's [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=704.48s)]
*  disposable incomes and their wages in a very real way. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=710.4s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Biden was not responsible for those two things happening. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=713.44s)]
*  But if you're an incumbent president, you're just going to get blamed for issues like crime [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=718.52s)]
*  and inflation. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=723.0s)]
*  That said, there's actually some remarkable developments on both those fronts, neither [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=724.0s)]
*  of which are getting much coverage. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=728.36s)]
*  Inflation is dropping steadily. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=731.24s)]
*  It's likely due to a confluence of factors, including interest rate hikes from the Fed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=733.32s)]
*  More importantly, in my mind, the continuing recovery from covid disruptions, which have [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=737.72s)]
*  taken a very long time to unwind. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=741.6s)]
*  In line that that we're also seeing an economy that is truly delivering for working Americans [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=744.52s)]
*  at the bottom of the labor hierarchy for the first time in recent memory. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=749.52s)]
*  This is a pretty striking story. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=753.52s)]
*  We have seen actual meaningful wage gains for the bottom portion of workers, even when [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=756.44s)]
*  you account for inflation. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=761.2600000000001s)]
*  Whether that continues or not is anyone's guess, but that trajectory is promising. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=763.72s)]
*  Then there's the question of crime and violence. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=769.84s)]
*  There's no denying that this nation is still utterly beset by gun violence in a way that [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  no pure nation is due in large part to the hundreds of millions of guns in people's hands. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=776.6s)]
*  Painful reminder this weekend over the holiday, 16 people were killed, dozens more injured [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=782.64s)]
*  in 17 mass shootings across the country, a problem that persists largely due to Republicans [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  commitment to an increasingly dangerous form of gun maximalism and fetishism. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=792.72s)]
*  In fact, one report from every town for gun safety found that most of us probably already [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=798.16s)]
*  believed to be true. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=803.22s)]
*  The 14 red or purple states with the weakest gun laws in the country have nearly triple [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=804.22s)]
*  the rate of gun deaths of the eight blue states with the strictest laws. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=808.98s)]
*  Even with that said, if you take a step back and you look at the numbers in the aggregate, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=813.78s)]
*  the levels of violence in America are definitely moving in the right direction. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not going to talk about this on Fox News, but it's true. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=823.5s)]
*  National crime data is a lagging indicator, but we do know that violent crime dropped [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  nationwide last year. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=830.66s)]
*  When it comes to homicide, the most serious form of violent crime, murder rates are down [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  in big cities across the country from New York to, yes, Chicago and Los Angeles. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=837.2800000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, Joe Biden's reelection pitch is going to be a story about a country recovering [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=843.84s)]
*  from an almost unthinkable set of unprecedented disruptions for a once in a century pandemic [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  to Donald Trump's attempted coup. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=854.44s)]
*  And to the extent that a return to normalcy was the promise of his 2020 victory, I think [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=856.94s)]
*  If these trends continue, President Biden is a much stronger political narrative in 2024. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=862.26s)]
*  He put the interests of himself above the laws of the state of Texas. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=872.18s)]
*  He put the interests of himself over the established laws, policies and procedures of the office [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=877.06s)]
*  of the attorney general. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=882.42s)]
*  He put the interest of himself over his staff, who tried to advise him on multiple occasions [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=884.7399999999999s)]
*  that he was about to violate the law. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=890.4200000000001s)]
*  Over the holiday weekend, Ken Paxton, who is perhaps the most notorious state attorney [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=893.62s)]
*  general in the nation, was impeached. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=897.58s)]
*  It was done by his own party in the Texas State House. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=899.26s)]
*  And for anyone who's followed his career, it's been a long time coming. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=902.14s)]
*  I mean, Paxton is basically an ethical train wreck. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=905.7800000000001s)]
*  He's been under indictment for felony securities fraud for eight years. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=909.62s)]
*  Nearly three years ago, seven top aides and deputy AEDs accused their boss of bribery [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=913.34s)]
*  and abuse of office. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=917.98s)]
*  He then fired several of them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=919.14s)]
*  They filed a whistleblower lawsuit that included accusations involving a campaign donor and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=920.6999999999999s)]
*  a renovation of Paxton's home. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=924.98s)]
*  But Ken Paxton's way of protecting himself is basically the same as Donald Trump's, which [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=927.9399999999999s)]
*  is, I'm taking on the lives, so I'm your hero. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=931.66s)]
*  And so he tried to rally his allies ahead of the impeachment vote. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=935.38s)]
*  Ted Cruz called the whole thing a travesty and none other than Donald Trump called to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=938.86s)]
*  free Ken Paxton. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=943.54s)]
*  But it did not work. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=945.86s)]
*  Part of the reason it didn't work is because the story Paxton's supporters are trying to [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=947.1800000000001s)]
*  tell here is the whole thing is some deep state plot by Republicans who are hand in [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=950.38s)]
*  glove with liberals. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=954.42s)]
*  What have you done to anger these establishment liberal Republicans? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=956.74s)]
*  Look, I've angered ever since I was in the Texas House, I ended up running against Joe [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=960.9s)]
*  Strauss, who was a Republican speaker. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=964.78s)]
*  And, you know, when you expose what these liberal Republicans do, which is basically [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  cut deals with liberal Democrats, they get really angry. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=972.1s)]
*  The last thing they want is somebody around like me who exposes what they do. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=975.78s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=981.3399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't Matt Gaetz have another job? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=983.14s)]
*  Why is he on the left side of the screen? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=986.74s)]
*  Sorry. It's a little hard to tell the story that Matt Gaetz, Newsmax host and Ken Paxton [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=989.66s)]
*  are trying to tell when you're talking about the state House Republicans in Texas, who [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=995.8199999999999s)]
*  are among the most right wing legislators of almost any state in the union. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=999.74s)]
*  And over half of them voted to impeach him. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1003.14s)]
*  So now Ken Paxton is suspended as attorney general and will face a trial in the Texas [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1005.98s)]
*  Senate where one of the people who could be sitting in judgment of him is his own [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1010.2199999999999s)]
*  wife, Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1014.02s)]
*  Texas State Representative James Tellerico is a Democrat serving the Texas House, and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1017.9s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1021.74s)]
*  I guess first, what was it like this weekend being a part of this? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1023.8199999999999s)]
*  Chris, thanks for having me on. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1029.46s)]
*  This is probably the most consequential vote that I'm going to cast as a member of the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1031.06s)]
*  Texas Legislature. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1035.54s)]
*  Removing a statewide elected official is no small matter. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1036.98s)]
*  And I know all of my colleagues put a lot of thought into this. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1040.9s)]
*  As you mentioned, Ken Paxton's record of corruption is pretty clear and pretty egregious, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1044.02s)]
*  but it was still no small thing. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1050.34s)]
*  And so it was a historic moment. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1053.1s)]
*  And I really couldn't be prouder of my colleagues in both political parties for coming [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1054.9s)]
*  together and holding a corrupt official accountable. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1059.98s)]
*  I have to say, I've followed Texas politics relatively closely for years and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1063.38s)]
*  followed Paxton. And they're interesting. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1069.46s)]
*  Texas Republican statehouse politics are particularly interesting because they face no [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1071.74s)]
*  big Democratic challengers. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1075.58s)]
*  There's enormous bloody factional fights between them all the time. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1076.82s)]
*  So like that that kind of thing isn't new. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1080.8600000000001s)]
*  But I don't quite get Paxton's been the same guy doing the same stuff for years. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1083.18s)]
*  Like, what happened here? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1088.66s)]
*  So there's one particular thing that happened. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1090.98s)]
*  So you mentioned those eight top lieutenants in the attorney general's office who blew the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1092.94s)]
*  whistle on Ken Paxton using his office to benefit a campaign donor. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1098.1s)]
*  And Ken Paxton settled with those eight lieutenants for three point three million dollars. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1102.74s)]
*  But since he committed his crimes in his official capacity, that three point three million [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1108.54s)]
*  dollars fell to the taxpayers of Texas to pay. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1113.78s)]
*  And that's when our state legislature got involved because we were being asked to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1117.22s)]
*  appropriate his settlement in our state budget. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1121.94s)]
*  That's when the investigation began back in March. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1124.8600000000001s)]
*  He also accused there's a sort of open warfare between the House Speaker, Dave Phelan and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1128.06s)]
*  Ken Paxton. He accused the speaker of the Texas House Republican of being drunk on the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1133.3s)]
*  job. We did play that clip of him very noticeably slurring his words the other night [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1138.38s)]
*  while gaveling over proceedings. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1143.62s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1146.02s)]
*  You know, I think it's it's no coincidence that Ken Paxton started throwing these [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1149.6999999999998s)]
*  allegations around the day that the General Investigating Committee in the House released [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1153.54s)]
*  their impeachment charges. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1158.3s)]
*  He's trying to divert. He learns from the best. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1160.1399999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump is his mentor, his biggest supporter. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1163.3s)]
*  And so he's going to throw everything but the kitchen sink in order to divert from the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1167.62s)]
*  real issue at hand, which is his corruption and the fact that his own party is going to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1172.26s)]
*  finally hold him accountable for it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2P_Tvu95Cc&t=1177.06s)]
