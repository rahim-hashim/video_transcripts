# Bombshell new report on the Supreme Court’s abortion leak
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw)
*  The political landscape rumbling loudly tonight after the explosive leak of a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=0.0s)]
*  draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe versus Wade. Chief Justice John [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=5.24s)]
*  Roberts today confirming the draft was genuine but calling the leak a breach of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=10.24s)]
*  trust and ordering an investigation into who did it. The decision, a sharply [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=14.76s)]
*  worded takedown of Roe v. Wade, has abortion opponents celebrating tonight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=19.64s)]
*  while leaving abortion rights supporters angry and worried. The leak of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=24.2s)]
*  decision overturning the right to an abortion in this country and the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=29.64s)]
*  behind-the-scenes fight that led up to it is the subject of this fantastic new [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  investigative piece in the New York Times. Reporters Jodie Cantor and Adam [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=36.0s)]
*  Liptaak explain how quote in overturning Roe the court set aside more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=39.72s)]
*  than precedent it tested the boundaries of how cases are decided and joining me [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  now is Jodie Cantor the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=48.28s)]
*  helped break this story for the New York Times. Jodie it's a great piece and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=51.8s)]
*  there's a bunch of stuff in here I want to get to. I want to start with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  bringing people back to the timeline which I had sort of forgotten a little [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=59.08s)]
*  bit until I read your piece today which is basically that this the Mississippi [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=63.16s)]
*  wants to to Mississippi passes this law banning abortion to 15 weeks they know [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=68.4s)]
*  it's frontally unconstitutional under the court's current jurisprudence but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=73.44s)]
*  they want to test it anyway and they want to send it up to the court and they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=77.56s)]
*  petition the court and then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies. Amy Coney Barrett [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=80.38s)]
*  replaces her. Tell us about the dynamics in what we think of as a conference in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=88.04s)]
*  that court about whether to take up the case knowing how adjacent it is to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=93.64s)]
*  Justice Ginsburg's death. So one of the things that Adam Liptaak and I found was [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=99.28s)]
*  that this was a real point of sensitivity for the court. You know it's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=105.72s)]
*  interesting on the one hand in our system of lifetime appointments the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=110.8s)]
*  passing of justices helps refresh the law it's part of what moves the law [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=115.16s)]
*  around moves to the law along but if the law changes too quickly after a justice [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  dies it can look like like this is like actually Amy Coney Barrett wrote years [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=125.72s)]
*  ago in a law review article it can look like this is about politics and power [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=131.6s)]
*  instead of law and reason so so there's this debate in early 2021 about whether [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=136.0s)]
*  to take up the case not how to decide it but whether to take it up at all and it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=143.08s)]
*  becomes a debate about timing it's very clear that this new conservative [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=148.24s)]
*  supermajority has the votes to hear the case they have the minimum of four in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=153.96s)]
*  fact initially they have five but there's disagreement about when to do it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=159.04s)]
*  justices Alito Gorsuch and Thomas were very eager they actually wanted to hear [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=164.36s)]
*  the case that term the term before it was actually held whereas justice [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=170.24s)]
*  Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett were a little reluctant justice Kavanaugh [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=175.96s)]
*  suggested a plan to relist it in other words to to withhold from the public the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=181.28s)]
*  court's decision to take the case and actually Justice Barrett made a really [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=187.8s)]
*  strong stand she said to the others if you try to take this case this term I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=192.12s)]
*  will change my vote from a grant a yes to a deny a no and then one of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  biggest surprises of the reporting is that that is what she actually ended up [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  doing she opposed hearing this case and it's key here to just set the context [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=209.64s)]
*  here when you quote that law review article right the perception from the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=215.64s)]
*  outside is the the the anti-ro justices are sitting around waiting for their [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=219.44s)]
*  colleague to die and then be replaced with a new person so even before her [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=224.96s)]
*  body is in the ground they can get to planning their long desired goal of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=230.56s)]
*  overturning row and I'm feeling I'm reading into things here that you didn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=236.0s)]
*  report I'm saying this is what it looks like to me is that just as Barrett is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  like that's gonna look bad for me personally like if we do this right away [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=244.4s)]
*  she is objecting to it but the most fascinating thing is that what Kavanaugh [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  suggests what they what they do is they decide to take the case and functionally [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=252.88s)]
*  deceive the public about doing so so they he named some reasons he says we're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=256.64s)]
*  gonna watch the lower court cases on abortion you know we're gonna see what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=263.92s)]
*  happens etc etc but it does have the effect of distancing creating the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=268.76s)]
*  appearance of distance from Justice Ginsburg's death and I agree with you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=276.08s)]
*  that Justice Barrett is in a fascinating position because remember [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=280.48s)]
*  that President Trump said that he was going to appoint justices who would [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=284.44s)]
*  automatically overturn row she gets appointed she is a favorite of abortion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=288.44s)]
*  opponents she has you know she has seven children you know that is the way she's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=294.8s)]
*  read in the public mind so I think actually the fact that she voted against [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  taking the case gives us a lot to think about in terms of the court and also [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=306.24s)]
*  about her you know what what is the meaning of her switching her vote [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=311.44s)]
*  ultimately you only need four votes they take the case and we all know that she [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=319.72s)]
*  ends up joining the majority which was their their gambit all along that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=323.08s)]
*  majority that she would in fact join it but just a I want to just because this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=326.8s)]
*  is a technical thing but it's important to me because in some ways it's my I [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=330.24s)]
*  think the top line of this reporting is that they basically decide they're gonna [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=333.48s)]
*  take it in February but they the way they communicate to the public isn't in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=337.48s)]
*  February we're gonna take this case instead they they relist it meaning we [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=342.0s)]
*  haven't decided yet we haven't decided yet and they keep doing that over and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=346.64s)]
*  over again they know they're taking it but they are saying well we don't know [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=350.0s)]
*  even though they know they took it three months after Ginsburg died from [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=354.44s)]
*  three months after there so the public doesn't know that but they know that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=359.52s)]
*  right I hear what you're saying but I'm gonna give you another interpretation of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  the facts this is also this is also introducing a delay that opens a window [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=371.2s)]
*  for persuasion because what happens next is that you know there's this sort of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  funny period when they have the votes but this is not publicly announced and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=383.52s)]
*  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Breyer a conservative and a liberal both very [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=388.48s)]
*  drawn to consensus neither of them interested in pursuing gobs have this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=393.64s)]
*  window for persuasion and they try to convince the two newest justices not to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=398.2s)]
*  take the case whether that affected Justice Barrett's decision we can't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=404.0s)]
*  totally say for sure but we know that she ends up changing her vote so so so [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=408.76s)]
*  the appearance point you make is a strong one but you also have to ask what [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  is happening strategically during during during this point because we know that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=420.04s)]
*  Justice Alito gets a little nervous and says to Justice Kavanaugh is your vote [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  firm and on that strategy so when we get to the actually they take the case they [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  hear the arguments they're they're they're drawing up the the opinion right [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=435.64s)]
*  that they have the five votes for overturning row frontally Mississippi [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=439.36s)]
*  has changed once the case gets taken they say we're actually not asking you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  to rule on this law we want you to go all out at row they go all out a row in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  oral arguments it's like do it do the whole thing they've got five votes there [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=453.24s)]
*  is an effort you report on by Breyer basically in Roberts to try to pull a [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=457.44s)]
*  justice away from that to find some consensus consensus position that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  upholds Mississippi law which would radically pair back rights but not end [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=468.68s)]
*  row what does the leak do to those efforts so that's another thing we're [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=473.0s)]
*  able to establish in this reporting I cannot tell you who leaked that document [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  I can't tell you for sure what the motive is but Adam and I can tell you [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=486.0s)]
*  the effect yes which is that the leak cemented these votes part of the reason [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=490.92s)]
*  that the votes are secret is that justices do sometimes change their mind [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  they want that freedom they need that freedom history shows us that it's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=502.32s)]
*  happened plenty of times with a lot of consequence and so the leak interferes [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  with that it's hard to say what would have happened anyway there isn't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=511.92s)]
*  overwhelming evidence that you know a comp you know three justice compromise [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=516.88s)]
*  that would have saved the right to abortion you know is on the cusp of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=523.0s)]
*  becoming reality we cannot say that but we know that the deliberative process [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=526.8s)]
*  was at play that there were efforts at persuasion the chief justice only needed [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=532.04s)]
*  one vote to make his 15 week position work and also chief justice sorry [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=536.68s)]
*  justice Breyer was so interested in this that he considered joining this 15 week [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=542.64s)]
*  position which would have been a symbolic move and then the leak comes [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=548.72s)]
*  those efforts become hopeless and so part of what we need to remember about [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=553.52s)]
*  this decision is that it really does look like somebody did something really [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=557.92s)]
*  inappropriate and and and intended to interfere with the process in some way [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=563.68s)]
*  that that reporting about the effect which also was new I mean we just didn't [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=568.4s)]
*  know we sort of know what happened but the effect is pretty profound and pretty [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=572.64s)]
*  interesting the whole piece is fantastic thank you Jodie Cantor for doing it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=576.24s)]
*  thank you for coming on tonight thank you thanks for having me Chris [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWsmuePZ7Rw&t=580.84s)]
