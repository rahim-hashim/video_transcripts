# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 15
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8)
*  And now we have new reporting from Hunter Walker at Talking Points Memo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=0.0s)]
*  He uncovered evidence that a congressional staffer, the digital director for Congressman [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=3.92s)]
*  Paul Gosar of Arizona, is a prominent follower of a neo-Nazi named Nick Fuentes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=8.52s)]
*  You may remember Fuentes as the racist Holocaust denier who Kanye West brought to dinner at [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=13.72s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago with Donald J. Trump last year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=18.28s)]
*  So what does all of this tell us? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=21.84s)]
*  That the right in America has mainstreamed a very dangerous, violent movement. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=24.88s)]
*  A threat to us all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=29.68s)]
*  And if you needed any further proof of that, just look at the tragedy that unfolded last [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=31.28s)]
*  weekend in Allen, Texas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=35.6s)]
*  The man who opened fire in an outlet mall and killed eight people, including a three-year-old, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=37.36s)]
*  expressed interest in white supremacists and neo-Nazi views. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=42.6s)]
*  And yet the denialism and whataboutism on the right sadly persists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=47.04s)]
*  Joining me now, Hunter Walker is the investigative reporter for Talking Points Memo, who I just [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=52.36s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=56.44s)]
*  And Giat is a professor of history at New York University and the author of The Lucid [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=57.44s)]
*  Substack where she writes about democracy and autocracy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  And Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for The New York Times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=64.12s)]
*  Thank you all for joining me tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=67.12s)]
*  Hunter, let me start with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=68.72s)]
*  Tell us more about your reporting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=70.12s)]
*  How close is this Gosar staffer to Nick Fuentes and his gripper movement? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=71.4s)]
*  So Nick Fuentes referred to chicken right, the online persona that can be linked to this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=77.0s)]
*  staffer as one of his best quote unquote soldiers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=82.38s)]
*  I also watched one of these, you know, extended Nick Fuentes streams where the chicken persona [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=86.68s)]
*  pledged loyalty to Nick Fuentes and to the white race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And there are extensive links between this online persona, which was fairly prominent, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  amassing over 20,000 followers in Nick Fuentes' movement and two staffers actually in Gosar's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=101.16s)]
*  office. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  When the accounts first launched, they were credited to quote Wade and Landon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=109.12s)]
*  Wade Searle is Gosar's digital director. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=113.4s)]
*  Landon Peterson is an intern in the office. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=115.76s)]
*  These accounts then ultimately tweeted photos that appear to be Wade Searle with Nick Fuentes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  when he attended a Nick Fuentes rally. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  They were tweeting from his hometown. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=126.5s)]
*  They were also, you know, tweeting indicating they were about the same age as him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=129.28s)]
*  So there's really extensive links. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=133.5s)]
*  And this is not just, you know, some run of the mill follower of Nick Fuentes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=135.16s)]
*  This is also someone who was in internal leadership chats telling the gripers, Nick Fuentes' movement, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  what was going on in Gosar's office. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=145.48s)]
*  And he was creating these videos and content and propaganda for the movement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is a high profile griper now working directly creating content for a U.S. congressman. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=151.56s)]
*  And I'm shocked that that congressman, I'm shocked that congressman is Paul Gosar. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=158.28s)]
*  Ruth, moving from Paul Gosar to Tommy Tuberville, what did you make of Tuberville's conflation [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=162.12s)]
*  of white supremacists and Nazis with MAGA supporters and Trump supporters? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=168.74s)]
*  So it makes perfect sense because Trump has been, you know, cultivating extremists. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned the very fine, you know, people neo-Nazi episode. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  But what we've got now is that Trump is openly, you know, appealing to people as a violent cult leader. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  He's not a conventional politician. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=192.9s)]
*  He's a cult leader. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=194.94s)]
*  And it's quite extraordinary. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=196.38s)]
*  It's like all of the white, all of the right-wing extremists from the entire 20th century, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=198.34s)]
*  their representatives and inheritors are now, you know, grouped around Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=204.86s)]
*  So you've got the neo-Nazis, you've got fascists, you've got people who love Pinochet and the military juntas, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=209.9s)]
*  the proud boys who wear shirts that say Pinochet did nothing wrong, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=216.5s)]
*  all the way up to the new right, you know, of Orban and Putin. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  And of course, historical racism and white Christian nationalism, Michael Flynn, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=225.22s)]
*  all of that has like had a confluence around Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  So I'm not surprised at all. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=235.78s)]
*  This is part of the culture that is the GOP today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=237.34s)]
*  And I believe Donald Trump promised over the weekend to bring Michael Flynn back if he's re-elected to office. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Jamel, while it is very good that President Biden is speaking out against the white supremacist domestic terror threat, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=246.3s)]
*  I have to ask, where is the broader political media legislative strategy from Democrats, from liberals, from the left, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=252.3s)]
*  for counteracting this mainstreaming of white supremacy in front of our very eyes on the right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=260.22s)]
*  You know, I don't know if there is a broad strategy here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=267.1s)]
*  I think that part of what makes talking about this so difficult, you showed this clips of folks on Fox News kind of dismissing this as ridiculous, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=270.86s)]
*  is that I'm not really sure that American political culture in general has any real way of talking about this or discussing this or preparing for it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=279.5s)]
*  You mentioned the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and that's instructive for a lot of reasons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=289.18s)]
*  First, obviously, as you said, the most deadly act of domestic terrorism in American history. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=294.66s)]
*  But in the wake of that bombing, there is a real reluctance to talk about the racial ideology. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=300.38s)]
*  It's a big debate, the people who helped organize it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=307.3s)]
*  And that kind of continued afterwards. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=310.1s)]
*  You could talk about domestic extremism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=312.38s)]
*  You could talk about the militia movement. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=314.38s)]
*  But talking specifically about white supremacist ideology is difficult. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=316.54s)]
*  And even, you know, we're in 2023. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  We have over the past seven or eight years, a number of shootings, mass shootings by avowed white supremacists, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=324.3s)]
*  to people with that ideology, the Charleston shooting, to the Tree of Life shooting in 2018, to the Allen, Texas shooting most recently. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=332.18s)]
*  This is a regular occurrence, this kind of violence in American life. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=340.86s)]
*  Biden is right to call it a serious threat. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=345.3s)]
*  And yet, beyond just the political system, I think Americans have a really tough time beginning to think of it as ideological and think of it as a threat deserving a concerted response. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's not simply people with hate in their heart. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=361.54s)]
*  It's something much more sinister and much more dangerous. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=363.82s)]
*  But Jamel, you don't need to worry, because I am absolutely sure that Kevin McCarthy is about to take action against Paul Gosar. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=368.18s)]
*  Isn't he, Hunter? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=374.86s)]
*  I don't think so. I've reached out to the speaker's office for comment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=376.9s)]
*  I've reached out to Paul Gosar for comment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=380.1s)]
*  And the only thing we've seen is Paul Gosar actually shutting off replies on his Twitter feed. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=382.26s)]
*  And I'm not surprised by that, honestly, because Paul Gosar, as you alluded to, has one of the most extreme histories in the current Congress. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  He's sent out links to anti-Semitic newsletters. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=397.22s)]
*  He's appeared twice at Nick Fuentes' political conference. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=400.98s)]
*  And this was a bit of an open secret on the far right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=404.98s)]
*  They were tweeting about how this guy was on his staff. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=407.62s)]
*  That's sort of how I caught on to it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=410.38s)]
*  Researchers in Arizona like Haley Orion and Nick Martin, who I worked with, were chasing this stuff. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=412.3s)]
*  We put it all together, but I don't think we're going to see action. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  And part of that is because of what we're talking about right now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=421.5s)]
*  I think Senator Tuberville said the quiet part out loud. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=425.26s)]
*  You know, this is the modern Republican Party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  White nationalism is a part of it and explicitly so. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=431.38s)]
*  You see people like Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene embrace the term Christian nationalism. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=435.22s)]
*  That clip you played before where they're attacking DEI, these are white supremacist talking points. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, what my reporting is trying to do is just expose how deep and extreme this goes and that it's actually tying directly to neo-Nazism. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=445.5s)]
*  Ruth, you're the expert here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  Hunter says this is the modern Republican Party. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  He's right, isn't he? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes. And indeed, if we look at what parties do when they're becoming more authoritarian extremists, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=460.66s)]
*  we're having a lesson right here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=468.94s)]
*  You have to look at who is leaving the party. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=471.1s)]
*  So you have people who were certainly conservatives, but were for law, rule of law, like Liz Cheney, Adam Kinsinger. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=473.18s)]
*  Those are out. Who's coming in? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=481.06s)]
*  Who's being recruited to come in? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=483.54s)]
*  The lawless, the violent, because autocratic parties need people who are lawless and violent. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=485.3s)]
*  And so also look at who the heroes are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=491.82s)]
*  People whose only skill set is that they know how to shoot guns like Kyle Rittenhouse, people who were involved in January 6th, who are being encouraged to run for office. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  They say, well, I'll run for office even from jail. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=504.58s)]
*  And that's what Trump says, too. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=507.14s)]
*  This is a lawless political culture. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=508.78s)]
*  And that goes right back to fascism. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=511.34s)]
*  You've got to have those people in the government as your political elite in order to sustain a violent and corrupt form of political rule. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=513.38s)]
*  That is some dark and worrying stuff. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  Jamal, last question to you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=525.78s)]
*  This video of a man brilliantly heckling the Patriot front went viral over the weekend. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  Have a watch. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=532.26s)]
*  Accomplishments. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=543.3s)]
*  But I cannot wear Wal-Mart khaki to speak of the will of the. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  At another point, he says, your pants don't even match. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=550.9799999999999s)]
*  Is this the way to defeat the fascists, to just make fun of them? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=553.9s)]
*  You know, I think for those kinds of events, that can be a very useful approach, right, when they're already gathered there and they're kind of just there making fun of them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=558.38s)]
*  But, you know, I live in Charlottesville, Virginia. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=568.3s)]
*  The Unite the Right attack is just a few minutes from from where I live, from right for my house. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=571.3s)]
*  And in the way in the lead up to that, there was a lot of debate in the city about whether we should even allow these groups to gather, whether whether that is something we want to ascend to give them the permit to let them do the thing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=578.86s)]
*  And I think looking back, the answer to that was clearly yes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=594.38s)]
*  And people said in the moment, yes, we should not let them gather here because giving them the space is essentially an invitation to violence. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's something that should be taken very seriously. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=607.14s)]
*  That for these groups that are often quite violent, that do have a violent ideology, simply heckling them and work. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=610.7s)]
*  But we should also be aware of the fact that opening up space to them does open up the potential for real violence and for real tragedy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=622.22s)]
*  These days, it's fair to ask who really is in charge in this country, because the momentous loss of the constitutional right to abortion, which has led to state abortion bans across the country, came from a ruling by just five right wing justices on the Supreme Court. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=632.98s)]
*  Last year's decision that Americans have a broad right to carry firearms in public, which puts state restrictions on firearms in jeopardy, also came from the Supreme Court's ultra conservative majority. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=648.18s)]
*  And now President Biden is considering a radical move to end the Republican Party's dangerous hostage taking on the debt limit by perhaps deploying the 14th Amendment, which requires the country to pay its debts. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=658.58s)]
*  A move that would then almost certainly be challenged at where else? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=669.9s)]
*  Our conservative Supreme Court these days, all roads lead back not to Congress or the president, but to those nine unelected justices, three of them appointed by Donald Trump alone. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=674.02s)]
*  And now a new study by four law professors estimates that Republicans are likely to keep control of the court for another 42 years until 2065, unless the court is expanded and rebalanced, which is precisely the goal of a bill that was first introduced in 2021. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=684.02s)]
*  And that would expand the court to 13 justices. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=702.26s)]
*  The bill sponsors Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Congressman Hank Johnson of Georgia plan to reintroduce that bill tomorrow. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=705.54s)]
*  And Senator Markey joins me right now, Senator. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=713.38s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=716.2199999999999s)]
*  I've been banging this drum for years to expand the court just out of interest, though. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=717.38s)]
*  How did you arrive at expanding the number to 13 justices? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=722.14s)]
*  Why 13 and not, say, 11 or 15? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=725.78s)]
*  Well, the Republicans, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, they were able to steal two Supreme Court seats, Merrick Garland seat, and then a week before the election in 2020, just jamming through Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=729.98s)]
*  So they stole two seats. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=745.62s)]
*  And with it, they upset the balance on the Supreme Court. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=746.7s)]
*  So we need to expand by two in order to get back to two seats, which were stolen, and then two more seats in order to restore the balance. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=750.82s)]
*  That had existed on the court. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  So we really don't have a choice. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=762.38s)]
*  It is constitutional. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  There were only six Supreme Court justices when the country began. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=765.9s)]
*  Abe Lincoln actually expanded the court to 10 seats. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=770.22s)]
*  So it's within the constitutional purview of the United States Congress to determine how many justices sit. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=773.86s)]
*  And you're 100 percent right on the history and on the Constitution. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=781.98s)]
*  But a common practical argument that many liberals, many of your fellow Democrats make against expanding the court, which is if we do it, then Republicans will do it back to us when they get power back. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=784.42s)]
*  And where will it end? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=796.26s)]
*  What is your response to that very common argument? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=797.5s)]
*  Well, the Republicans are the court packers. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=800.54s)]
*  They did that in 2016. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=802.9399999999999s)]
*  Then they expanded that one more time in 2020. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=804.42s)]
*  They stole two seats. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=808.58s)]
*  So it's like the bully down the schoolyard. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=809.58s)]
*  If you let the bully keep stealing your lunch money, nothing's going to stop them in the future. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=812.62s)]
*  So the only question is, are we going to stand up to the bullies? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=817.62s)]
*  Are we going to try to restore the balance that did exist before they engaged in this ahistorical thievery of two Supreme Court seats? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=820.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't think we have a choice. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=830.26s)]
*  Otherwise, the bullies will win over and over again. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=831.5400000000001s)]
*  They will never stop. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=834.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes. And they changed the size of the court whenever they like. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=836.86s)]
*  They held it at eight for almost all of 2016 after Scalia died. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=839.54s)]
*  Senator, you and several Democrats in the House in the Senate and House have called for Clarence Thomas to resign. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=843.62s)]
*  Justice Thomas, in light of all the revelations around the gifts and lavish vacations he's received from billionaire conservative activist, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=848.42s)]
*  Honan Crowe, why aren't more Democrats in the House and Senate demanding stop Thomas step down? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=854.7s)]
*  I mean, what is stopping the Democratic Party as a whole from saying this guy's got to go? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=859.86s)]
*  Well, I think that Justice Thomas should resign. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=864.66s)]
*  And I think there's going to be an increasing chorus as each week, month, year goes by tomorrow. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=868.02s)]
*  In fact, on the steps of the Supreme Court, Planned Parenthood is going to come to endorse my bill, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=875.54s)]
*  as is Nehru because they can already see the catastrophic consequences of the Dobbs decision in in changing abortion rights in our country. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=882.1s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a growing chorus. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=892.58s)]
*  And I also believe that if the Supreme Court does not pass its own code of conduct, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=895.06s)]
*  that the United States Congress will impose a code of conduct on them. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=901.42s)]
*  I think that increasingly it is clear that we need to lift the standards of this Supreme Court so that they are playing by a set of rules that match what the highest aspirations of our country are for the court. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=905.62s)]
*  So just on that, Senator, Chief Justice Roberts declined a request from the Senate Judiciary Committee, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=921.06s)]
*  controlled by Democrats to testify about the court's ethics or lack of ethics code. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  Shouldn't your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee ask Justice Thomas himself to testify? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  And if he refuses, subpoena him. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=936.14s)]
*  But can they even do that when Senator Dianne Feinstein still can't really show up and do her job properly even now, even after returning to D.C.? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=938.7399999999999s)]
*  It seems to be a bit of a shambles on the Democrat led Senate committee. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=945.42s)]
*  Well, I think that Senator Durbin is doing an excellent job with the majority, which he has, knowing that Senator Feinstein has been away. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=949.46s)]
*  And I think he is putting together a very good strategy that is building the chorus towards a code of ethics being adopted by the Supreme Court or ultimately having the United States House and Senate have to do it for them. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=959.22s)]
*  So I think Dick Durbin is doing a very good job. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=975.54s)]
*  And as each day goes by, as each new atrocity emanates from this Supreme Court, I think that there's going to be a consensus that action has to be taken. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=977.46s)]
*  And yet, Senator, Dick Durbin has not called for Thomas to resign, as you have, has not called for Thomas to testify. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=988.62s)]
*  And recently, he said history will judge the Roberts Court. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=993.9s)]
*  It's not history's job to judge. It's Senate Democrats' job to hold the Supreme Court accountable. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=997.22s)]
*  Well, it's why I'm introducing tomorrow with Congressman Hank Johnson, with 60 House members, with senators, the Judiciary Act of 2023 to expand the Supreme Court. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1002.98s)]
*  We need to take action. We need to repeal the filibuster. We need to expand the Supreme Court. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1015.58s)]
*  We have to deal with this constitutional crisis that has been created by the Republican usurpation of the Supreme Court. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1020.66s)]
*  And that's going to be the challenge of this time. And we can't agonize. We have to organize. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1029.46s)]
*  And I do believe that the momentum is growing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1034.1000000000001s)]
*  And the revelations about Justice Thomas, the Dobbs decision, the Bruin decision in terms of concealed carry, the decision on the environment, other decisions that are about to make about democracy, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1037.1000000000001s)]
*  they're all building a crescendo, which, in my opinion, is going to point towards the passage of the Judiciary Act of 2023. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1049.14s)]
*  I hope you're right. I'm glad you're introducing your bill. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1057.26s)]
*  I hope the president gets on board because he's been very anti-court expansion. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1059.74s)]
*  I hope you get through to him, Senator. Ed Markey, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1063.22s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXkqs_SwkI8&t=1068.18s)]
