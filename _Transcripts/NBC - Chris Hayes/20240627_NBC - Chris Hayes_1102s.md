# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 26
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Once again, the Supreme Court making news today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=0.0s)]
*  both for what they did do and what they did not do. The court did not rule on Donald Trump's wild [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=4.32s)]
*  desperate bid for total immunity for the crimes he committed while in office. A case that is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  very clearly the most pressing in terms of immediate deadlines, not to mention stakes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=16.16s)]
*  for American democracy. It's one in which this court's conservative majority has, at this point, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=20.8s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, obviously and intentionally dragged their feet to protect Trump from going on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=26.0s)]
*  trial before November's elections on charges of trying to overthrow American democracy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=31.12s)]
*  But everything you want to know about the Supreme Court can be learned from the decision they did [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=36.64s)]
*  release today and later from the decision they accidentally released today. You see, for a brief [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=39.68s)]
*  moment today, the court posted a copy of a decision that appears set to allow emergency room doctors [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=45.04s)]
*  in Idaho to perform abortions in certain situations. They quickly took it down and we're going to have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  more on that later. But the first decision, the one they actually meant to actually put up and they [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=55.76s)]
*  read, the one they released on purpose, well, how can I put this? It effectively legalized blatant [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  public corruption. Again. The case was called Snyder v. United States and involved this man, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=67.36s)]
*  James Snyder, the former Republican mayor of Portage, Indiana. Now, back in 2011, then candidate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=74.0s)]
*  Snyder pitched himself to voters as a successful businessman, the owner of a mortgage company, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=80.16s)]
*  who could bring fiscal responsibility to the city of Portage. You had my commitment that fiscal [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=85.12s)]
*  responsibility is so much more than a campaign slogan or a catchy phrase. As a business owner [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=91.44s)]
*  in the mortgage industry, we were on the front lines of the economic disaster. Each month, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=97.44s)]
*  fiscal restraint was realized in different ways with my employees and me. Because we managed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=103.2s)]
*  and navigated prudently. Our doors are part of the 5% of mortgage companies still open in Indiana. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=109.68s)]
*  By 2013, Snyder was now the mayor. That pitch was successful to the voters. It seems his theory [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  of fiscal responsibility had not quite borne out. As the Chicago Tribune reports, it was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  Christmas time 2013 and James Snyder was in trouble. His mortgage business had tanked. The IRS was after [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  him for a significant tax debt. And on top of that, he had holiday spending to account for. So [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=133.28s)]
*  Snyder showed up unannounced to Great Lakes Peterbilt, the local truck dealership he'd helped to win [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=138.48s)]
*  two lucrative city contracts. I need money. That's what I'm here for, the mayor told the owners. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=145.28s)]
*  Days later, the dealership cut Snyder a check for $13,000, saying it was for consulting that was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  never fully performed. Okay, all right. So he steers contracts to this dealership. He shows up, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=157.44s)]
*  he's desperate, he says, I need money. They give him $13,000. I'm not a lawyer, but a sitting mayor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=164.08s)]
*  marching into the office of a business where he had steered a million dollars in government contracts [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=169.12s)]
*  and saying like, give me cash does not sound entirely on the up and up. And you know what? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  The Department of Justice agreed. Snyder was indicted on federal corruption charges back in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  2016 and after a lengthy back and forth and multiple trials, he was found guilty in 2021. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=183.28s)]
*  The court of his former mayor will spend 21 months behind bars. A federal judge handed down [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=189.12s)]
*  the sentence yesterday. A jury convicted James Snyder of taking a $13,000 bribe from a trucking [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=195.68s)]
*  company and a legal tax evasion. Snyder has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He argues [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=203.04s)]
*  the $13,000 was just a fee for his consulting work. Though what that consulting work is, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  is a little unclear. What's more, it couldn't possibly be a bribe. And this is important. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  This is what he argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. It couldn't be a bribe, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=217.44s)]
*  you see, because he received the money after the contracts were allocated. So if anything, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=220.72s)]
*  it was more like a tip for a job well done. Like he just, you know, like a barista, like he just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=227.44s)]
*  moved the screen around and the guy was like, yeah, 13 K boom. Wouldn't you know it? The Supreme [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=233.12s)]
*  Court agreed. Today, they threw out Snyder's conviction. Here's how Justice Brett Kavanaugh [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=239.84s)]
*  put it in his opinion. The question in this case is whether the law also makes it a crime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=245.84s)]
*  for state and local officials to accept gratuities, gratuities, for example, gift cards, lunches, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=250.48s)]
*  plaques, books, framed photos, or the like that may be given as a token appreciation after the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=256.4s)]
*  official act. The answer is no. Framed plaques, books, you know, that thing. See, Snyder just [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=262.96s)]
*  accepted a gratuity, a little tip as a reward for steering a million dollars in contracts for a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=272.96s)]
*  trucking company. It was like a nice book or a commemorative plaque or $13,000. And here's the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  thing. This is like sort of a narrow statutory interpretation decision about this aspect of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  federal code. Was it proper to prosecute him under this law? But the decision does not exist in a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=290.24s)]
*  vacuum. You have to understand this. This comes against the context of the Supreme Court that has, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=294.56s)]
*  first of all, increasingly lost the public's trust. And that's not just because Samuel Lito [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=299.12s)]
*  keeps flying insurrectionist flags outside his various homes or because Clarence Thomas's wife, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=304.16s)]
*  Ginny, was texting Trump's White House chief of staff conspiracy theories about the Bidens being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=308.48s)]
*  sent to Guantanamo Bay. But because of the allegations of rank, obvious corruption leveled [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=312.48s)]
*  against those two men, particularly Clarence Thomas, the subject of our absolute favorite bar [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=317.6s)]
*  chart, which documents the $4 million in disclosed and undisclosed, what would I call it? Oh, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=322.64s)]
*  gratuities that he has received while on the court, like a luxury RV worth a quarter of a million [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=328.4s)]
*  dollars trips on a private jet in a super yacht. How do you think that guy feels about public [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  corruption laws, whether getting gratuities is prosecutable? How about Justice Alito, who got a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=338.88s)]
*  free fishing trip from Republican mega donor Paul Singer and a hundred grand's worth of free travel [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=344.56s)]
*  on a private jet? What do you think his take is on ethics rules for government officials? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=349.2s)]
*  Would you be shocked to learn that both of those men voted to throw out James Snyder's conviction today? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is not a one off. This is really important. This court has shown itself [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  both in practice and in theory to be committed to a pro corruption agenda. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=365.52s)]
*  In 2010, the Roberts court limited the scope of federal corruption law in the case of convicted [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=371.28s)]
*  Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling. In 2016, it overturned the conviction of former Virginia Republican [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=375.84s)]
*  Governor Bob McDonald, who, along with his wife, accepted nearly two hundred thousand dollar in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=381.6s)]
*  gifts, gratuities, you might call them, and loans for local businessmen, including vacations, clothes, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=386.16s)]
*  Rolex. In 2020, it threw out the convictions of former New Jersey government officials in the corrupt [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=391.36s)]
*  Bridgegate scandal as they intentionally caused a massive traffic jam on the George Washington [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  Bridge to punish a political rival. Now, to be clear and fair here, those decisions were not all [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=400.56s)]
*  right down all ideological lines. This one was, and it is clear the Trump Sixth Street [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=406.0s)]
*  conservative majority are the ones dictating a new, more radical direction of this court, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=410.8s)]
*  including today's decision. They really do seem to, in the aggregate, want to get rid of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=415.04s)]
*  criminalization of corruption and bribery. They want to make corruption legal and acceptable for all. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=421.76s)]
*  And considering they went out of their way to bail out a former Republican mayor from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=428.64s)]
*  Spaltown, Indiana, what do you think we're willing to do for the former Republican president of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=431.84s)]
*  United States? In tomorrow's presidential debate, abortion rights will obviously be a big topic. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=436.08s)]
*  The thing to keep in mind as you watch is that whatever Donald Trump says in the debate and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=443.44s)]
*  whatever any Republican says, the fact is that to its core, the Republican Party is committed to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=447.28s)]
*  banning access to abortion for all women in this country everywhere. It is what the strongest, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  most activated members of that party want and what they're going to do. Take a look at what just [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=458.8s)]
*  happened in South Carolina. There were three Republican state senators there who had stood [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=464.16s)]
*  in the way of an incredibly draconian abortion ban. And then when they did that, they were all [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=468.16s)]
*  primaried and all three of those women lost their primary races to anti-abortion men last night. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=473.6s)]
*  That is the way that gravity pulls in today's Republican Party. Every single Republican, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=480.8s)]
*  from state representatives all the way up to Donald Trump understands that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=485.28s)]
*  I'm joined now by House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, congresswoman from California. Good to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=489.28s)]
*  have you on speak. My pleasure. Thank you. You're someone who spent a lifetime in politics from the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  time that your father was the mayor of Baltimore. So you understand the way that political incentives [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=500.4s)]
*  work. When you look at what has happened in the Republican Party, when you look at something like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  last night where these three state senators had stood in the way of this ban, they get primaried, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=510.56s)]
*  they lose. What does that do to the way that Republicans understand what they have to do [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=516.64s)]
*  and what they will do about abortion, no matter what messaging they're going to say on a debate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=523.12s)]
*  stage? Well, thank you very much for your question. It's good to be here as we observe the two-year [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=529.2s)]
*  anniversary of the jobs decision. And I can tell you that this week we've had a drumbeat across [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=537.2s)]
*  America of events all over talking about how we have to reverse that decision with law by winning [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=543.36s)]
*  the election and enshrining Roe v. Wade in the law of the land. And also how people see it as a kitchen [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=551.2s)]
*  table issue. This is an economic issue for families, the size and timing of their families, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=560.48s)]
*  or if they're going to have a family. It's a freedom issue. It's a democracy issue. It's about [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  freedom for women to make their own choices. So when you see that election in North Carolina [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=572.88s)]
*  last night, it was heartbreaking. Those women were courageous. They went out and said what they [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=579.6s)]
*  believed. And that was rejected by the voters. But we have to make sure that the voters know. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=585.6s)]
*  And one thing they will know is the difference between Joe Biden and the former president of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  the United States. If the other guy wins, there will be no question there will be a national [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  abortion ban in our country. I say that very sadly as a Roman Catholic, as a person who had [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=605.84s)]
*  five children and six years in one week. Very wonderful. A joy to us. That was our choice. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  Other people should have their choice. So this tomorrow night, you'll see a split screen on the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  subject of respect for women. You'll see a split screen on their economic life. And the list goes [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=627.04s)]
*  on that we can talk about, but to stick with jobs for a moment. One of the things that we were [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=635.68s)]
*  observing this week as we had our drumbeat across America was access to contraception. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=642.24s)]
*  How many Republicans do you think in the House of Representatives voted for a woman to have the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=649.44s)]
*  right to contraception? Eight. One hundred and ninety five Republicans voted no. Women do not [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=656.4s)]
*  have a right to contraception. We're not talking abortion. We're talking contraception. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=666.64s)]
*  So this is about they believe in they don't believe in birth control, but they do believe [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=672.8s)]
*  in controlling women. So women have to recognize. And that, as I say, that election last night told [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=679.76s)]
*  me that not enough people were paying sufficient attention to what it was at stake and what it [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=685.92s)]
*  meant to those women, to their families, for their children and the rest, for them to have an [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=691.68s)]
*  economic issue, a freedom issue, a personal choice issue just pulled away from them in that way. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=698.4s)]
*  And if he wins, well, it can't win. I mean, it cannot happen. Well, he might. But it can happen. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=706.64s)]
*  But understand this. I hate to tell you, we went through it once. It doesn't. It makes sure it [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=712.7199999999999s)]
*  doesn't for a lot of reasons. One of them is that there will be an abortion ban in our country. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=717.2s)]
*  That's a guarantee. Let me ask you. Let me ask you a follow up. But by the way, I'm still my mind is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=724.24s)]
*  still running the math on five children in six years and one week, which is I guess I knew I knew [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=728.24s)]
*  as an abstract fact about your life. But wow, that's incredible. There are two things they say. One is [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=732.88s)]
*  Trump says no national ban. Well, I'm not going to do a national ban. And two, and this, I think, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=742.48s)]
*  gets to something you're saying here. And I was just mentioning it before. When you poll folks, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=749.76s)]
*  there's maybe 20 percent of voters who don't even realize that it was Donald Trump's Supreme Court [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=752.48s)]
*  that took away Roe v. Wade. I mean, there's something like 15 to 20 percent of voters that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=757.36s)]
*  think Joe Biden is responsible for the overturning of Rome. Well, that's so interesting because he [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=760.24s)]
*  takes great pride in the fact that he packed the court against the women. And Mitch McConnell was [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=767.92s)]
*  his his accomplice in all of that packed the court against women going out there, taking great pride [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=775.28s)]
*  of it in certain audiences and other audiences saying, I'm not going to do a ban. And then there [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  are other things that are contingent upon this. For example, he says when you see the split screen [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  tomorrow in favor of a woman with respect for her ability to make her choices on the other side, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  a ban, a ban on contraception, a ban on terminating a pregnancy, a ban on your free choice and your [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=804.4s)]
*  liberty. And then you see things that go with it. This is a health issue. He says, and I quote him [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=812.96s)]
*  and it's crude, but he is abortion. So excuse me. The Affordable Care Act, Obamacare sucks. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=819.68s)]
*  No, it doesn't suck. It cures. And he says, oh, if you need have preexisting conditions, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=828.8s)]
*  I'm going to take care of you. No, we wouldn't. The bill he put forth didn't even have anything [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  about preexisting conditions in it. And if it did, it would be so expensive that forget about it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=839.92s)]
*  So then you look at something else. People are concerned about inflation. 16 Nobel laureates [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=847.12s)]
*  came out this week and said that if what's his name, we're elected president with his fiscal policies, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  inflation would just increase enormously in our country. And you have Joe Biden on the other side [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=863.6s)]
*  of that screen leading the world in reducing inflation in our country. So if you talk of any [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=871.28s)]
*  subject, you can talk about if your young people care so much about another scientific issue, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  climate saving the planet. Bozo went on, sat down at the table with fossil fuel industry executives [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=885.52s)]
*  and said, give me a billion dollars for my campaign so I can reverse what they have done [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=895.36s)]
*  with the IRA to save the planet. Joe Biden is there has been he was the first person in the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=903.36s)]
*  Congress of the United States way back in the 80s, even before I was there to introduce a resolution [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=910.16s)]
*  calling for the Senate to address the climate crisis. Let me ask you, let me ask you this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=918.4s)]
*  question. I think most folks watching this agree about the sharpness of these contrasts, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=923.92s)]
*  certainly on these policy areas. I think they're correct. Right. There's real, real choices about [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=930.0s)]
*  health care, abortion rights, the climate and big oil, even on inflation. I think, you know, that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=934.64s)]
*  why given how sharp is the contrast, what do you tell yourself when people ask you as they ask me, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=941.92s)]
*  how is it so close? What's your answer to that? Well, I don't think it's going to be so close. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  And don't forget, we didn't mention guns. There are other issues where the split screen is a very [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=953.12s)]
*  sharp contrast. The I'm a big believe we don't agonize about who says what we organize. We own [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=959.52s)]
*  the ground. We get out our vote. Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States again. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=967.52s)]
*  He will be and and Kamala Harris, the vice president. We're very proud of that. And we [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=974.0s)]
*  are organized. I'm going all over the country. I'm a former chair of the party. You know, I came up [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=980.48s)]
*  into all of this being a grassroots organizer to get out the vote on the political side, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=985.12s)]
*  to get out the vote. I can smell a good campaign or not. And I'm telling you, the scent is there. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=991.6s)]
*  People are ready. Now, just for example, in the election of 2022, you will recall that the pundits, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1000.32s)]
*  wherever they are, were saying we were going to lose 30 or 40 seats. Correct. They didn't know [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1008.64s)]
*  what they were talking about. They didn't know what they were going to have a tsunami was it or a red [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1013.84s)]
*  wave or some such thing. They had a little eye dropper. We lost five. We'll get them back. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1019.52s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries will be the speaker of the House. Chuck will be the leader of the majority in the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1024.72s)]
*  Senate. And Joe Biden will be president of the United States. But but back to 22, I kept saying, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1030.56s)]
*  why are they saying that? And even Democrats were going on TV saying, oh, she's got it all wrong. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1037.36s)]
*  She's saying a woman's right to choose. Dobbs is a big deal in this election. Yes, it was. They said [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  it's all in the rearview mirror. Women don't care that much. Yes, they do. Yes, they do. So that's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1049.6799999999998s)]
*  one issue. Yeah. And that's a very important issue because it's a freedom issue. Yeah. It's personal. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1056.32s)]
*  It's health. It's freedom. Well, economic. And we still have seen in special election after [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1062.32s)]
*  sexual election, the that sort of driving energy that you you talk about in 2022 has showed up at [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdWLPES8ps&t=1067.76s)]
