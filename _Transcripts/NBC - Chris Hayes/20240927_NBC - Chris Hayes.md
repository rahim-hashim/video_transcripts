# Leaked 2020 DMs reveal JD Vance ripped Trump as ‘emperor’ who ‘failed to deliver’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0)
*  As of right now, there is just one debate left on the calendar before Election Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  On Tuesday night, Vice Presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz will face off in what may be the last chance for Americans to directly contrast their campaign's messages. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=4.0s)]
*  Now, since joining their respective tickets, Vance and Walz have taken very different approaches to campaigning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=14.0s)]
*  While Tim Walz has focused on hitting the trail, spending way less time with the press and doing interviews, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=20.0s)]
*  it seems like JD Vance is always talking to the media, often with pretty disastrous results. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=26.0s)]
*  In the polling average, Vance's net favorability rating is more than 11 points underwater. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=32.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Walz is holding SETI at 3.8 points net favorable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=38.0s)]
*  It's not all that surprising when you consider the way that JD Vance has taken on this role, where he basically acts like a flamethrower of messaging. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=43.0s)]
*  He will say the most negative, wildly unpopular thing, no matter how much it makes people dislike him. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=49.0s)]
*  It goes all the way back to his now infamous line, back when he was just before joining the ticket, about childless cat ladies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=54.0s)]
*  We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=61.0s)]
*  I don't like this. I don't like to admit this. I don't like that this is a fact of life. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=69.0s)]
*  But if you're, if you are a psycho and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=73.0s)]
*  You have a lot of people saying my pets are being abducted or geese at the city pond are being abducted and slaughtered right in front of us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=79.0s)]
*  Today we got new reporting about more instances of Vance putting his foot in his mouth. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=87.0s)]
*  Although these might anger his running mate even more than his potential voters. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=91.0s)]
*  The Washington Post obtained messages Vance sent to an acquaintance harshly criticizing then President Trump in February of 2020. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=95.0s)]
*  Vance wrote in part, quote, Trump has just so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=104.0s)]
*  And another a few months later, Vance predicted, I think Trump will probably lose. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=110.0s)]
*  I certainly hope we get to hear Vance try to wriggle his way out of this one at the debate just a few short days from now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=115.0s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist in New York Times. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=121.0s)]
*  Margaret Taleb is the director of Syracuse University's Institute for Democracy, Journalism, Citizenship, where she's been running focus groups most recently with young male voters. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=123.0s)]
*  She's also a senior contributor at Axios. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=132.0s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=134.0s)]
*  Michelle, I have come to view, I think what JD Vance, some of what JD Vance is doing is not intentional, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=135.0s)]
*  Like a lot of the stuff that people don't like about him were things he was saying in right wing outlets when he's trying to win a very right wing primary for Ohio Senate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=142.0s)]
*  But since he's become the nominee, he hasn't changed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=151.0s)]
*  And I think of it basically a kamikaze mission, which is people are not going to like me and I don't care. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=153.0s)]
*  I'll be like low on favorability, but I'm going to deliver this kind of poison into the discourse every day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=159.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's effective or not, but how do you read it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, I would say, I mean, I think that that is certainly going to be his approach in the debate, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=167.0s)]
*  Because people don't like him, so he can be mean. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=173.0s)]
*  He can be vicious. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=176.0s)]
*  And what he has to do is turn right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=177.0s)]
*  Tim Walz is one of the most popular politicians in the country, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=181.0s)]
*  Even after all sorts of mirrors about his military service attacks on his family and the like. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=186.0s)]
*  And so what JD Vance has to do is just drag Tim Walz down into the mud with him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=192.0s)]
*  And I think that he will probably be pretty vicious and pretty skillful in trying to do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=198.0s)]
*  What I hope Tim Walz does, I mean, you mentioned his Washington Post story. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=206.0s)]
*  I think this is such a bombshell. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=210.0s)]
*  And I really think that the political media and the political world is underreacting to this because we all knew that JD Vance, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=213.0s)]
*  you know, said all these things about Donald Trump compared him to Hitler, compared him to heroin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=221.0s)]
*  And his story for why he's now on the ticket is that Donald Trump's presidency changed his mind. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=226.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's presidency proved him wrong. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=234.0s)]
*  So here he has here he is saying that Donald Trump failed in the thing that Donald Trump supporters kind of point to as the central reason why he should be returned to office. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=236.0s)]
*  I mean, this is just I think this undoes the entire conversion narrative that JD Vance has tried to has tried to spin. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=248.0s)]
*  And it's so incumbent on Tim Walz to make that clear to people and not just to make that clear to people, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=257.0s)]
*  but just as Kamala Harris kind of needled Donald Trump when she was on stage with him, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=263.0s)]
*  I think that Tim Walz can do this remotely because I don't think Donald Trump knew about these quotes and he's not going to be happy to find out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=268.0s)]
*  Yes, JD Vance's verdict on him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah, the running mate secretly declared your presidency a failure is a pretty big story. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=279.0s)]
*  Margaret, you've been doing these these focus groups, particularly with young men and JD Vance, I guess, counts as a young man in politics. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=285.0s)]
*  Tim Walz a little less so. But I do think they're both sort of chosen and whether this is borne out by the data or not to sort of appeal to certain conceptions of masculinity, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=292.0s)]
*  certain kinds of male voters. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=302.0s)]
*  I wonder what you think undecided voters are going to be looking for or taking away from these two guys when they face off next week. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=305.0s)]
*  I mean, Chris, the most recent group of young men voters who we were talking to, and these are focus groups with Syracuse, Engageus and NBC News, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=313.0s)]
*  were sort of split among men who lean toward Trump and men who lead toward Kamala Harris. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=324.0s)]
*  And the trend that we saw very clearly was that those voters who were still skeptical but lean toward Trump are doing so either because they really like Trump [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=331.0s)]
*  or because they don't like Harris. But the other group, the voters who were leaning towards Harris, were leaning towards Harris because they don't like Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=342.0s)]
*  It's not Harris in particular that they're enamored with. In many cases, they see her as the lesser of two evils. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=350.0s)]
*  I think with this debate coming up, normally vice presidential debates are not hugely consequential because people are not voting for the number two person on the ticket. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=356.0s)]
*  But the gender gap between Trump and Harris is so significant. And there isn't really, there's a really different dynamic with the vice presidential candidates with the other, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=365.0s)]
*  the lower half of the ticket where you see both, you see not just with women but with men polling that shows that Tim Walz is actually the more popular candidate. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=376.0s)]
*  So it's possible that he has the ability to help solidify some of those voters who were men and leaning toward Harris but not completely confident. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=387.0s)]
*  On the other hand, Vance really does have an opportunity to take Tim Walz down a peg or two. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=397.0s)]
*  And so the dynamic I'm going to be looking for is sort of the flip of what both men are known for. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=402.0s)]
*  Are we going to see more heart and relatability from JD Vance in this debate? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=408.0s)]
*  Are we going to see more substance from Tim Walz? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=413.0s)]
*  Well, or more cutthroatness. I mean, I think that's the interesting thing is like how much he goes on the attack. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=416.0s)]
*  And I do think, Michelle, there's one more case that hasn't been made here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=420.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the oldest guy to ever run for president since Biden dropped out. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=424.0s)]
*  His, you know, his brains are leaking out of his ears, metaphorically speaking, not literally. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=428.0s)]
*  He's like he's losing his grasp. JD Vance has a very good chance of running the country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=435.0s)]
*  Like as an actuarial manner, like it's not he's not just some emissary messaging. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=442.0s)]
*  The guy could have the nuclear codes. And I think that's a worthwhile thing to press. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=448.0s)]
*  Like, is this guy ready for that is a genuine question that I don't think people have been talking about enough. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=452.0s)]
*  No, I think that's absolutely true. The possibility that JD Vance could be president in 2026 or 2027 is something that we have kind of collectively failed to both reckon with. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=458.0s)]
*  And I think make clear to people that this is a very real possibility. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=469.0s)]
*  And it's strange because we I think the media did a good job of both dissecting the kind of Joe Biden's very the way Joe Biden had faded. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=473.0s)]
*  And I think it was pretty clear that a vote for Joe Biden was at least potentially a vote for a president Kamala Harris. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=486.0s)]
*  But people just haven't thought through what it would mean to have this vicious and dishonest and deeply misogynist and also deeply an experienced figure as the president of the United States. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=494.0s)]
*  Guy's been a senator for two years. All his jobs before that were given to him by Peter Thiel. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=508.0s)]
*  But the nuclear coast, Michelle Goldberg, Margaret Tallah. Thank you both. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=513.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yhiLSKVJ0&t=524.0s)]
