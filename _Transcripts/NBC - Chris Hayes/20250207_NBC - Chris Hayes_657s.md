# Musk rehires DOGE staffer who posted ‘I was racist before it was cool’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo)
*  Good evening from Washington, D.C. I'm Michael Steele in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's war on the government is intensifying and he has empowered the world's richest man, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=4.98s)]
*  Elon Musk, to do the job. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=10.66s)]
*  Musk and his minions are storming federal buildings and causing havoc. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=13.24s)]
*  Protesters are hitting the streets and gathering outside government buildings to block Musk's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=17.8s)]
*  access and voice their outrage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=22.8s)]
*  Today, House Democrats arrived at the Department of Education seeking a meeting with employees [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=25.92s)]
*  of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  But they were blocked from entering. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=34.44s)]
*  It was at least the fourth time this week that members of Congress were denied entry [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=36.52s)]
*  to a federal agency that they fund. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=41.14s)]
*  As elected officials and Americans are trying to figure out what to do to stop this activity, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=44.8s)]
*  the courts are responding. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=51.86s)]
*  Today, a judge in Washington put a temporary hold on Musk and Trump's plans to fire almost [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=53.88s)]
*  the entire staff at USAID. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=59.84s)]
*  Even so, Musk is plowing ahead and he's doing it with the president's full approval. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=63.12s)]
*  Is there anything you've told Elon Musk he cannot touch? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=69.12s)]
*  Well, we haven't discussed that much. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=74.0s)]
*  I'll tell him to go here, go there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=77.12s)]
*  He does it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=78.88s)]
*  He's got a very capable group of people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=79.88s)]
*  Very, very, very, very capable. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=82.28s)]
*  They know what they're doing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  But as this continues, we're learning more and more about this quote, capable group. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=88.0s)]
*  It was just yesterday when one 25-year-old Musk staffer who had sensitive access to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  Treasury payment system quit his job when the Wall Street Journal connected him to a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  social media account full of racist hatred. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  He was apparently posting stuff like, quote, I was a racist before it was cool and you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=107.68s)]
*  could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity and normalize Indian hate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And get this, Elon Musk is mad that the staffer had to quit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=120.12s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  He attacked the journalists even who wrote that story, folks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=127.68s)]
*  Oh, but it gets better. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=131.24s)]
*  JD Vance, you know him, the Vice President of the United States, posted that he agreed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=133.23999999999998s)]
*  with Musk. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  And apparently, so does Donald Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  One of the Doge engineers was fired for some inappropriate posts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=144.16s)]
*  The Vice President says, bring him back. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=151.6s)]
*  Well, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the Vice President said that, did you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=152.6s)]
*  say that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm with the Vice President. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=159.2s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=160.2s)]
*  This is all part of an emerging pattern, folks. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  Today, reporters found that another Musk staffer reposted white supremacists online. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  And we also learned today that yet another one was fired from a previous job with a cybersecurity [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  firm for leaking company secrets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  And because all of this centers around Elon Musk, the guy Donald Trump dispatched to dismantle [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  the government, Trump is having to answer a lot of questions about Musk. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=186.28s)]
*  I mean, just look at the cover of the latest Time magazine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=192.2s)]
*  Elon Musk behind the President's resolute desk, holding a cup of coffee. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=196.0s)]
*  And you would think Trump would hate this kind of stuff, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, because he has in the past. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Because Musk is getting all the attention. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  But he appears to be taking it all in stride. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=211.56s)]
*  Is Time magazine still in business? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=215.32s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=217.12s)]
*  The Time magazine is still in business? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=218.6s)]
*  Elon is doing a great job. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=221.72s)]
*  He's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=224.72s)]
*  You see it with the USAID, but you're going to see it even more so with other agencies [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=228.44s)]
*  and other parts of government. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  He's got a staff that's fantastic. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=235.72s)]
*  He really loves Musk's staff, the people breaking what works for you in government to make it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=239.36s)]
*  work for them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=245.4s)]
*  Now, there's hope. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Because there are Republicans on Capitol Hill and they're ready to stop this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=250.04s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  They could put up those guardrails for Trump and rein in the unelected billionaire, but [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=255.6s)]
*  they won't. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  We see this as an active, engaged, committed executive branch authority doing what the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=263.96s)]
*  executive branch should do. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=269.96s)]
*  Some of my colleagues are screaming like they're part of a prison riot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=271.64s)]
*  He's basically doing an audit, so I hope that he'll soon be issuing a thorough report to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  Congress and the public. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  This is a reform movement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  And for all the outrage bingo that my Democrat colleagues and many in the legacy media are [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=285.08s)]
*  playing, they ought to pace themselves because it's going to be a long four years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=289.56s)]
*  Republicans are not just going to stand up to Donald Trump at this point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=295.24s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  Decades worth of chances. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  And now here we are. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=302.44s)]
*  Susan Glaser is a staff writer at The New Yorker where she recently wrote about Elon [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=304.36s)]
*  Musk's revolutionary terror. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=309.16s)]
*  April Ryan is the Washington bureau chief and senior White House correspondent for Black [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=311.48s)]
*  Press USA. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  They join me now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  Susan, let's start with your New Yorker piece on what this Musk purge is all about. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=318.68s)]
*  You wrote, if cutting the federal government is what this is all about, then Trump and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=327.04s)]
*  Musk would not be bothering with tiny USAID, whose estimated budget of some 40 billion [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=331.36s)]
*  dollars is less than 1% of the federal governments. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=337.44s)]
*  The point is not a policy fight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  It's an execution. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  They're killing one agency to terrify a thousand others. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=345.8s)]
*  Those words are so true and it is so obvious. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=351.2s)]
*  Talk a little bit more about, from your reporting, what are you hearing and understanding, what's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  really going on here and how these dominoes are starting to play out and fall out around [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=361.8s)]
*  the country across federal agencies? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=370.08s)]
*  I mean, look, I think it's really important to the Republicans, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=372.08s)]
*  they think they have a strong hand. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  They think that nobody cares. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=378.32s)]
*  That the government has been demonized pretty successfully for decades by the Republican [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=380.92s)]
*  Party, essentially going back to the Reagan era. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=387.12s)]
*  It's been a core part of the ideology of the GOP that the best thing that the federal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  government can do is get out of the way. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=397.72s)]
*  Many Americans across the political spectrum believe that they don't see what the government [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=399.8s)]
*  to keep your drinking water clean, to keep the planes safely in the sky, to stop infectious [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=406.32s)]
*  diseases outside of the country before they get here, which is one of the core missions [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  of USAID funding that's now being cut. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  And so in part, it's a reflection of their political assessment that these are vulnerable [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=419.28s)]
*  targets because remember, Donald Trump is a bully and what he likes is to punch down, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=424.96s)]
*  whether he is punching at Canada and Mexico and Denmark rather than going after Russia [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  and China or going after a tiny foreign aid agency. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=435.16s)]
*  So I think that's part of it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  The other part that's really striking, though, is that it is it's not about policy, Michael. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=442.0s)]
*  And I really I find it hard this week, right, because everybody wants to say, like, oh, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=448.48s)]
*  let's make the case for my favorite policy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  It's not about policy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's be honest about that, at least. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=456.36s)]
*  If you want to have a disagreement with Republicans on Capitol Hill and Democrats about what they're [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  funding, then do that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=464.4s)]
*  We know how to do that as a country. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=466.0s)]
*  We have a system that works for that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  Congress appropriated this money. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=470.4s)]
*  There were negotiations and complicated deals that resulted in what we have right now. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=472.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is taking a hatchet to the federal government and hoping that he can do as much [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=477.0s)]
*  damage as possible before the courts catch up with him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=482.08s)]
*  So let's just be honest about that's what's happening here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=485.28s)]
*  In talking about being honest, April, there was this this recent letter from the acting [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=489.88s)]
*  U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, who, quite honestly, may not actually [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=496.64s)]
*  be authorized to practice law in the District of Columbia. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=502.52s)]
*  But you know, it's the Trump era. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  In this letter, he notes that, thank you for the referral of individuals and networks who [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=508.56s)]
*  appear to be stealing government property and or threatening employees. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=513.36s)]
*  If people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=518.24s)]
*  investigate them and we will, quote, chase them to the end of the earth to hold them [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=524.32s)]
*  accountable. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=530.4s)]
*  This is a prosecutor, D.C. prosecutor, chasing people to the end of the earth. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=532.6s)]
*  What are you finding out there as you sit in those briefings at the White House, as [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=542.52s)]
*  you talk to members on the Hill? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=547.2s)]
*  How is this going down? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=551.8s)]
*  And also talking to those who are in the Republican Party as well, how it's going down, what many [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=554.6s)]
*  who are working with Doge are hoping for and relying on are for those who are in these [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=560.48s)]
*  agencies and in these departments to rat on their fellow colleagues. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=567.04s)]
*  And that's what they're doing in an effort to thin out what they consider the waste. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=572.0s)]
*  An act of thinning. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=576.64s)]
*  This isn't an audit. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  This is an act of thinning of government in this moment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=578.8s)]
*  And what we're understanding is everybody will be impacted, but they are definitely relying on [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=582.4s)]
*  those who are having whisper campaigns and tattling on their fellow colleagues. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  We're in a whole different time than where we had been before. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  And what you were talking about was with the Postal Service. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=598.4s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing that in the FAA. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=601.3599999999999s)]
*  We're seeing that in transportation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  We're seeing it potentially getting ready to happen in the Department of Education. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=606.08s)]
*  They're relying on the military to do the same thing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  It's in every department. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=614.32s)]
*  And we also saw today they were taking down the signs for the USAID, the logo that's on the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  building. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=625.84s)]
*  This is what they're relying on. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=626.64s)]
*  This is not professional. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=628.32s)]
*  This is hearsay in a lot of instances. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=629.6s)]
*  And where's the backing up if you're doing this audit? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=631.84s)]
*  Where are the receipts, the young people would say? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCzMgpNXmo&t=634.08s)]
