Video Description: Misogyny has been central to Trump's identity—and there is a constituency for this 14-year-old boy's idea of what manhood is. But it's just as repulsive to large swaths of the electorate—especially women, says Chris Hayes.

# ‘Trump’s your daddy’: MAGA runs campaign of overt sexism, creepiness
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU)
*  Twelve days out from the election and what is the message Donald Trump wants voters to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=0.0s)]
*  take away from his campaign? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=3.56s)]
*  We got a hint of it last night at Trump's rally in Georgia where a fired Fox News host [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=5.42s)]
*  who now does stuff on his Twitter account described Trump as the father of the country [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=9.78s)]
*  and he called on the crowd to vote Trump for Trump because Tucker Carlson hates bad little [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=14.26s)]
*  girls. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=20.42s)]
*  There has to be a point at which Dad comes home. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=22.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=25.82s)]
*  Dad comes home. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=36.540000000000006s)]
*  And he's pissed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=37.540000000000006s)]
*  Dad is pissed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  He's not vengeful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=46.14s)]
*  He loves his children. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=48.46s)]
*  As disobedient as they may be, he loves them because they're his children. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=50.5s)]
*  They live in his house. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=55.1s)]
*  But he's very disappointed in their behavior and he's going to have to let them know. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=57.42s)]
*  He's going to have to get to your room right now and think about what you did. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=62.86s)]
*  And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=69.06s)]
*  You've been a bad girl. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=72.34s)]
*  You've been a bad little girl and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=74.8s)]
*  And no, it's not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=79.62s)]
*  No it's not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=82.58000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  And you earned this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=87.54s)]
*  You're getting a vigorous spanking because you've been a bad girl. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=89.7s)]
*  Okay, first of all, get some therapy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=93.54s)]
*  Second of all, this is not just the creepy fantasizing of a disgraced TV personality [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  with a mommy issues you can see from space or one of those weird right wing podcasts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=104.5s)]
*  He said that on a national stage as part of the Republican presidential campaign, warming [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=110.58s)]
*  up for a man whom a jury of his peers found liable for sexual assault after he defamed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=115.3s)]
*  the woman who said that Donald Trump raped her in a dressing room. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=120.64s)]
*  The Republican Party is now very much explicitly running on a campaign of male dominion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=126.62s)]
*  Trump's your daddy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=131.9s)]
*  Well, as I checked, we're all adults here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=133.78s)]
*  And he stands ready to put all the nasty women, as he calls them, in their place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=136.34s)]
*  The idea that this overt sexism is a viable electoral strategy has gained a lot of currency [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=141.06s)]
*  lately. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=146.86s)]
*  Polster John De La Volpe writing about it in New York Times this week saying, aware [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=147.86s)]
*  that boasting about killing Roe v. Wade drove away young women, Mr. Trump zeroed in on capturing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=150.78s)]
*  a larger share of the young male vote. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=155.16s)]
*  His playbook, A Masterclass in Bro-Whispering. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=157.9s)]
*  De La Volpe cites Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency along with his decision to give a prime speaking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=161.62s)]
*  spot of the Republican National Convention to UFC President Dana White, who of course [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  was infamously videotaped slapping his wife in 2022. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=170.94s)]
*  Just as journalists once obsessed over the white working class, they're now focusing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=176.54s)]
*  on the anxieties, political agency of men, particularly young men. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  Republicans were capitalizing on this well before Kamala Harris entered the race. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=185.14s)]
*  You think back to January when Trump was facing that primary challenge from Nikki Haley and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=187.9s)]
*  his disapproval of rule ratings among women became a campaign issue. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=191.94s)]
*  And far right Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders, he's the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  one who's being investigated by the ethics committee for possibly having sex with an [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=198.98s)]
*  underage sex worker, told conservatives to trust the process because it was all baked [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=210.06s)]
*  For every Karen we lose, there's a Julio and a Jamal ready to sign up for the MAGA movement [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=211.06s)]
*  and that abodes well for our ability to be more diverse and to be more durable as we [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=217.02s)]
*  head into not only the rest of the primary contests, but also the general election. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=221.94s)]
*  Now, a certain far right mind alienating women makes them more diverse because they think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=225.62s)]
*  it will peel off votes from black and Latino men. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=229.78s)]
*  It's cynical, it's gross, I think it's pretty condescending. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=232.14s)]
*  What are they going to do to sell Donald Trump? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=235.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=237.82s)]
*  This is the man who bragged about ending Roe v. Wade because he did end it, who has dozens [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=238.82s)]
*  of sexual assault allegations, including a new one this week from a woman who says [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=243.22s)]
*  Trump groped her after, guess who, Jeffrey Epstein, Trump's buddy of all people, introduced [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=246.94s)]
*  them and that Trump groped her as he looked at Jeffrey Epstein and the two men were exchanging [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=252.42s)]
*  smiles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=256.98s)]
*  That guy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=258.22s)]
*  This is the man who was convicted of 34 felonies in a New York court after paying an adult [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=259.22s)]
*  film actress to stop her from divulging his extra-marital relations with her while his [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=263.22s)]
*  wife was home with their newborn child. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=267.9s)]
*  Misogyny has been central to Trump's identity and in a weird way to his political appeal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=272.02s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear, there really is a constituency for this, I guess, 14-year-old [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=276.02s)]
*  boy's idea of what manhood is or for grown men that are in a state of suspended animation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=281.38s)]
*  But also I think it's pretty repulsive to large swaths of the electorate, especially [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=288.78s)]
*  women, obviously. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  A new UMass Amherst poll shows 50% of women prefer Kamala Harris, which is just 43% for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=298.82s)]
*  Her advantage among young voters is even greater. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=299.82s)]
*  A new NBC poll of Gen Z voters shows her winning young women over Trump by a whopping 33%, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=301.82s)]
*  while her advantage among young men is only 2%. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=308.46s)]
*  So there's a 31-point gap. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=310.54s)]
*  Joining me now is Ian Sams, senior spokesman for the Harris campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=312.26s)]
*  Ian, let me ask about this sort of gender gap that we're seeing in poll after poll. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=317.1s)]
*  Is the campaign concerned about outreach to men, particularly young men, where there's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=322.7s)]
*  such an enormous gap, according to some of the polling we're seeing? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=328.46s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=331.7s)]
*  No, I think that we're seeing voters in the late stages of this campaign gravitate toward [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=333.82s)]
*  the vice president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=338.18s)]
*  I think you just showed a little bit of the dynamic that's at play, where Donald Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=339.38s)]
*  is poised to lose women by a historic margin. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  He's poised to lose college-educated women by an even larger historic margin. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that there's an under-focused point on this issue of a gender dynamic in this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  case. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=358.06s)]
*  Men across this country are pretty repulsed by what Donald Trump did as president. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=359.06s)]
*  We're going tomorrow, the vice president is going tomorrow to Texas, which is really ground [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=362.66s)]
*  zero of the consequences of some of the extreme abortion bans that we've seen that Donald [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=366.98s)]
*  Trump has helped make possible. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=372.1s)]
*  And she's going to talk about the importance of this issue, which is one of the most important [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=374.38s)]
*  issues in this election. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=378.14000000000004s)]
*  It is one of the most motivating issues. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  There's a recent NBC poll, for example, that you guys have at your network showing that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=381.22s)]
*  it was the most important issue to voters in this election of all issues. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=385.34s)]
*  And she's going to talk about the consequences of this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=389.61999999999995s)]
*  And this week, for example, we have a new ad on the air, features the tragic story of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=391.78s)]
*  a woman named Andrea who is from Texas and who will be with the vice president tomorrow, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=395.85999999999996s)]
*  and her husband, who she had a miscarriage and she had horrible surgery, and she's unable [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  to have kids again. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=406.02s)]
*  And they're heartbroken by it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=407.02s)]
*  That's a real man. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=408.05999999999995s)]
*  That's a real man standing with his wife saying, this is tragic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  And you're seeing stories like that across this country of men who are seeing the consequences [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=413.26s)]
*  of Donald Trump's actions and are motivated to vote to protect their own freedoms, to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=418.1s)]
*  protect the freedoms of their spouses and their daughters and their family members. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=423.24s)]
*  And so I think that in a couple of weeks, when voters come to the table and make their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  final choice of who they're going to go vote for, this dynamic of the gender gap is really [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=430.98s)]
*  going to reflect poorly on Donald Trump. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=437.06s)]
*  He's going to lose this race because he's losing voters and isolating them because of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=439.62s)]
*  the consequences of his behavior. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=444.58s)]
*  And it is something that an appearance on a podcast that his staff had to tell him existed [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=446.66s)]
*  is not going to fix. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=452.18s)]
*  And the way that they have doubled down on their own base, you see the really weird clip [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=455.22s)]
*  from Tucker Carlson that you just showed, that's intended only to play with their own [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=461.5s)]
*  very narrow base. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=466.34s)]
*  And the more they spend their time talking to that segment of the electorate, the more [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  unappealing they become to the rest of the electorate. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=471.86s)]
*  And so we're very confident about the dynamics that are playing out right now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=474.94s)]
*  We're confident that voters, as they make up their mind, are seeing the choice between [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=478.78s)]
*  these two candidates, the division and frankly, the weirdness of Donald Trump versus Kamala [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=481.82s)]
*  Harris, who's trying to be a president for all Americans and actually focused on the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=487.7s)]
*  real issues that they care about. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=490.74s)]
*  You mentioned podcasts and Donald Trump is going to be on Joe Rogan's podcast, I think [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=493.62s)]
*  tomorrow that's taping in Austin. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  The vice president now she'll be on Shannon Sharpe's Club Shashe podcast, which is always [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=501.14s)]
*  entertaining. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=506.78s)]
*  Can I ask you about Rogan? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=507.78s)]
*  Was there a Rogan invite to the vice president that was turned down? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=509.18s)]
*  Is it something you would consider doing given the size of that audience and given that a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=512.5s)]
*  lot of the folks that Trump seems to be targeting might be listening to that? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=517.54s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think that the vice president's happy to go anywhere and any place to talk [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=523.58s)]
*  to a broad segment of the country. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=527.74s)]
*  We talked with Rogan and his team about the podcast. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=529.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, it isn't going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=532.86s)]
*  period of the campaign. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=537.22s)]
*  But, you know, she's taking her message to these huge platform audiences, even like Club [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=538.22s)]
*  Shashe, like you just talked about. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=543.1s)]
*  She was able to sit down with Shannon Sharpe today. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  And so she's happy to go into these places and share her message. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=546.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think that it's reaching people who aren't really invested in the political process. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=550.3s)]
*  Donald Trump with Joe Rogan, that's going to be an interesting thing to watch. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=554.66s)]
*  It will be. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  Final question for you, Ian. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=559.4599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has been very annoyed by your appearances on Fox and he said he was going [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=560.4599999999999s)]
*  to go talk to Rupert Murdoch about it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=563.78s)]
*  Have you been back on Fox since they had that conversation? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMqcYuPBGU&t=565.8199999999999s)]
