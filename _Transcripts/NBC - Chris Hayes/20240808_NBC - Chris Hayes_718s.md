# ‘Spiraling, whining, and miserable:’ Trump melts down as Harris surges in polls
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is shook [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=0.0s)]
*  With less than 90 days to go before the election the race has taken a turn. He clearly did not see coming [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=4.1s)]
*  Last month after the Republican National Convention remember that just a few weeks ago [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=10.58s)]
*  He was jubilant. I mean Trump and his campaign clearly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Told every reporter they could on and off the record that they were gonna coast to victory that it was in the bag [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=18.66s)]
*  In fact Trump was already measuring the drapes the Oval Office [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Staffers were scrambling to call dibs on jobs in the administration [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  But of course then well things changed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=31.8s)]
*  President Joe Biden did what few people thought possible something remarkable and honorable and decided to step aside from the race [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  The Democratic Party almost immediately coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement the process to get to that point was wrenching [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=42.22s)]
*  Excruciating and difficult but it is very obviously transformed the race in a whole bunch of different ways [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=51.5s)]
*  The Democratic campaign with Kamala Harris rising to the top of the ticket took in a record-breaking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=57.04s)]
*  310 million dollar fundraising haul in July [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=63.18s)]
*  Donald Trump raised less than half that amount over the same time period the enthusiasm for the vice president has been palpable in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=66.66s)]
*  Enormous crowds as she is growing rally after rally after rally and in the polling [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=74.34s)]
*  A recent survey found that nearly half of all voters say that Harris becoming the nominee makes them more motivated to go to the polls [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  And there's been a definite shift in the numbers and the head-to-head polling Harris now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  Leads in the polling average nationally by more than two points [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=91.84s)]
*  Joe Biden was down by more than three points before he dropped out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=95.56s)]
*  That's a five-point swing just doing the math in my head and five-point swings in an electorate this polarized are an enormous deal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=98.56s)]
*  The dynamics of this election have also been fully recast with President Biden no longer running [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=106.14s)]
*  Donald Trump is now the only elderly man the race [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=112.06s)]
*  He would be the oldest president ever inaugurated if he wins in November [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=115.22s)]
*  He would have the nuclear codes at the age of 82 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=120.94s)]
*  The focus shifted away from Biden [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=125.02s)]
*  It is easier to see that underneath the fake tan and the strange hairdo is a 78 year old man a man well past [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=127.22s)]
*  Retirement age seeking the most demanding and stressful job in the world [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=135.2s)]
*  Don't forget running for president just running for the job is about as exhausting an endeavor as you will find [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean at least normally the way it's done and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=145.16s)]
*  Donald Trump really does seem to be feeling it which no shade [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=148.2s)]
*  I think I would be too if I were him in this week. He is doing exactly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=151.12s)]
*  One [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=158.56s)]
*  one [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=160.0s)]
*  campaign event in the solid red safe state of Montana [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=161.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's dumped the usual grueling travel schedule on his 40-year-old running mate following Kamala Harris and Tim Walz over the country [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=167.42s)]
*  And what the nation just dubbed a stalker tour [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=174.94s)]
*  Today Trump's sole public activity the only thing he did publicly to campaign for president [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Did take him quite far all the way down the hall of Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=183.5s)]
*  To hold a press conference in front of a select group of reporters [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=187.56s)]
*  The typically rambling hour-long event took place in the dark and cavernous main living room with Trump flanked by an ornate piano and two kind [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=190.72s)]
*  of labras the vibe a mix of Liberace and vampire [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=197.98s)]
*  Looking really worn down and spent and exhausted and like a man who is just not having any fun [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=201.84s)]
*  The former president floundered from one absurdity to the next [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=208.52s)]
*  We have a lot of bad things coming up and we're very close to a world war in my opinion [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=213.06s)]
*  We're very close to a world war we were given Joe Biden and now we're given somebody else [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=217.54s)]
*  Heavy into the transgender world heavy into lots of different worlds [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=222.82s)]
*  You have people dying financially because they can't buy bacon everybody's gonna be forced to buy an electric car [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=227.34s)]
*  Which they're not gonna do because they don't want that we have commercials that are at a level [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=232.38s)]
*  I don't think that anybody's ever done before nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech his great speech and you look at ours [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=240.78s)]
*  Same real estate same everything [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=246.88s)]
*  Same number of people if not we had more [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=249.96s)]
*  President Xi of China and I were very good friends [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=252.96s)]
*  We met right here right in that except we had a beautiful sofa there [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=256.16s)]
*  It's a hard room because it's very big if you know [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=259.96s)]
*  So this is worth 18 million dollars. I know Willie Brown very well [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=262.36s)]
*  In fact I went down in a helicopter with him we thought maybe this is the end Trump was right about everything [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=267.18s)]
*  I have been right about a lot [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=272.54s)]
*  Not right about going down in a helicopter with ex San Francisco mayor Willie Brown [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=275.54s)]
*  Something that had it happened. We would know about Willie Brown of course saying today that of course never happened [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=280.42s)]
*  Doesn't seem like it's likely the case that the Jan six crowd that assembles that Trump could hurl them violently at the Capitol [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=285.42s)]
*  The American Constitutional Republic was as large as the famous March on Washington at which Martin Luther King gave the I have a dream speech [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=293.66s)]
*  Trump also seems to have resigned himself to the fact that he will have to face off against Harris in front of the cameras telling reporters [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=301.16s)]
*  He wants to appear now at three debates including the one he'd already negotiate with Biden [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=308.16s)]
*  Although he got the order wrong and the network one. We wants to do a Fox one [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=312.0s)]
*  But that was the one he tried to pull out of when Harris was at the top of the ticket [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=315.0s)]
*  But that was the one he tried to pull out of when Harris was at the top of the ticket [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=319.34s)]
*  So then the vice president responded from the tarmac in Detroit before taking off for her next campaign stop in Phoenix [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=323.34s)]
*  Well I'm glad that he's finally agreed to a debate on September 10th I'm looking forward to it and hope he shows up [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=329.34s)]
*  Are you open to more debates? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=337.34s)]
*  I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after September 10th for sure [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=339.34s)]
*  Despite his claims today that he's looking forward to debating Kamala Harris [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  Trump still appears to be more than a little bit obsessed with his former opponent [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=348.67999999999995s)]
*  He's been posting over his website like desperate strange fan fiction about quote a big movement to bring back crooked Joe [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  And there's like lots of folks in his orbit who are trying to will this to happen as if they can like pull off some Jedi mind trick [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  And get Biden back on the ballot [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  Trump is really just underscoring the fact that he and his campaign despite constantly saying that Biden was going to drop out [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=370.02s)]
*  That he was going to be replaced at the last minute [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=377.02s)]
*  This is the thing they said all the time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=379.02s)]
*  Somehow ended up woefully unprepared for that exact eventuality and not prepared to run against Kamala Harris [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=381.02s)]
*  And nearly three weeks in they still don't appear to have figured out how to do this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=387.02s)]
*  How to adjust their strategy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=391.02s)]
*  Because we are in a very different world [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=393.02s)]
*  One where Donald Trump is no longer the clear favorite [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=395.02s)]
*  It's a real race [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=397.02s)]
*  He might lose it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  And we all know Trump just cannot handle losing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  He almost brought down the American experiment because of it [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  And that is why we have seen him swing wildly from overconfident to spiraling, whining, and very obviously miserable [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  Meredith McGraw is a national political correspondent for Politico [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=416.35999999999996s)]
*  And author of Trump in Exile [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Jamelle Bowie is an opinion columnist in the New York Times [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  Where he wrote this week about Trump's birther bag of tricks [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  They joined me now [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  Jamelle, I guess I'll start with you about that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=427.7s)]
*  I don't know what you call it today [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=429.7s)]
*  At one level, the word news has new in it for a reason [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=431.7s)]
*  And part of the reason I think that Trump doesn't make news for how strange these appearances are [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=435.7s)]
*  Is because most of his appearances through his political career have been quite strange [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=441.7s)]
*  But it does really seem to me that he is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=445.7s)]
*  Brain seems more scrambled [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=447.7s)]
*  He has a harder time keeping a thought [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=449.7s)]
*  And he also seems like he's not having fun [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=451.7s)]
*  I think all of that is correct [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  With Biden out of the race, it's so clear how much more diminished he is compared to 2020 [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  And certainly to 2016 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think this press conference made that clear [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  His appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists Conference makes that clear [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  Every time he has one of these extended appearances, it becomes all the more clear [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  That this is simply not the same guy of four, eight years ago [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  And the guy of four, eight years ago wasn't particularly cultured [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  But I think you're right [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=481.38s)]
*  Into the fact that he appears to not be having any fun whatsoever [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=483.38s)]
*  And I think it's an important part of his appeal in 2016 and 2020 [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=487.38s)]
*  Was the sense that Trump was having fun [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=491.38s)]
*  This was sort of like an enjoyable, fun, celebratory thing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=493.38s)]
*  And the extent to which this is really a dour campaign from Trump so far between him [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=497.38s)]
*  Even Vance's appearances are these very kind of terse of the Trump campaign [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=503.38s)]
*  And these very kind of terse events [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that's the meaning [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Meredith, you do have a book out about Trump in exile [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=515.72s)]
*  Which is partly about his time down in Mar-a-Lago [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=517.72s)]
*  And it was sort of, there was something kind of darkly comedic to me about the fact that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=519.72s)]
*  People are noting the fact that J.D. Vance is flying all over the country [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=523.72s)]
*  Harrison Walls is doing all these events [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=527.72s)]
*  Trump has one event, so he's like, fine, I'll do an event [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=529.72s)]
*  Come down to Mar-a-Lago [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=531.72s)]
*  That's for after the event [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=533.72s)]
*  Which, again, like I said, no shade [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=535.72s)]
*  And then, number 78, that's how I would want to script it, too [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  But how do you understand the strange lack of events [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  Which isn't just this week [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  But actually, if you count up the numbers, he just has not been on the road [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, he was asked about that today at the press conference [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  And he scoffed at it, pushed back at the question [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  But the press conference we saw today [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  This was classic Trump in so many ways [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  Look, he was trying to contrast himself with Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  Who's received some criticism about not doing any interviews or press conferences [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  Herself [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=566.4s)]
*  But really, this is about him trying to take the spotlight [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=568.4s)]
*  Off of the momentum that the Harris Walls campaign has had [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=570.4s)]
*  Since Walls was announced [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=576.4s)]
*  And since Harris took the top of the ticket [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=578.4s)]
*  Inviting reporters down there to pepper him with questions [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=580.4s)]
*  Showing off Mar-a-Lago [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=582.4s)]
*  But really going all over the map [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=584.4s)]
*  In terms of his answers to questions [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=586.4s)]
*  In a way to try to defend himself [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=588.4s)]
*  And try to get the attention [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=590.4s)]
*  Of the press [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=592.4s)]
*  To defend himself [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=594.74s)]
*  And to try to turn the media's attention away [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=596.74s)]
*  From the real momentum that we have seen [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=600.74s)]
*  Just in this past week [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=604.74s)]
*  This is, let me stay with you on this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=606.74s)]
*  Because I do think Maggie Heyerman made this observation too [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=608.74s)]
*  She was down there today [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=611.74s)]
*  Just like, he doesn't like when the attention is not on him [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=613.74s)]
*  And there was all these people who were saying [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=615.74s)]
*  When during those brutal three weeks [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=617.74s)]
*  The Democratic Party after the Biden debate [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=619.74s)]
*  Leading to his withdrawal from the race [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=621.74s)]
*  He was being so savvy [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=623.74s)]
*  He's laying low [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=625.74s)]
*  But he wasn't actually laying low [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=627.74s)]
*  Like if he went to truth social [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=629.74s)]
*  He absolutely was not laying low [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=631.74s)]
*  It's just that the attention wasn't on him [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=633.74s)]
*  He seems to think more attention on him the better [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=635.74s)]
*  Do you think that's the fundamental thesis [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=637.74s)]
*  That he has about the campaign? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=639.74s)]
*  Well, for Donald Trump [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=641.74s)]
*  It's always so important to have attention [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=643.74s)]
*  Good or bad [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=645.74s)]
*  And you know, if you think just three weeks ago [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=647.74s)]
*  Where the Republican Party was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=649.74s)]
*  Donald Trump just got the nomination [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=651.74s)]
*  In Milwaukee [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=653.74s)]
*  There were balloons flying [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=655.74s)]
*  Smiles [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=657.74s)]
*  The Republican Party was simply [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=659.74s)]
*  Confident and gleeful at the idea [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=661.74s)]
*  Of going up against President Biden in November [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=663.74s)]
*  And so much has changed [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=665.74s)]
*  In a short matter of time [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=667.74s)]
*  And the Trump campaign has tried to argue [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=669.74s)]
*  That the fundamentals of the race [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=671.74s)]
*  Haven't changed here [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=673.74s)]
*  But you saw in the press conference today [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=675.74s)]
*  When Trump was asked about poll numbers [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=677.74s)]
*  That Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=679.74s)]
*  Is getting a lot of attention [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=681.74s)]
*  And support from Black women [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=683.74s)]
*  And it was sort of a tacit acknowledgement [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=685.74s)]
*  Of the state of the polling [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=687.74s)]
*  And the new state of the race [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=689.74s)]
*  Now that Harris and Walz are on the ticket [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=691.74s)]
*  Thank you [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HtG5w3vq4o&t=709.74s)]
