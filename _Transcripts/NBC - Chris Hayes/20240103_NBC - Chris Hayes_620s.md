# Nancy Pelosi makes the case for Biden 2024: ‘Let’s get back to that kitchen table’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4)
*  Joining you now is Speaker Meredith Nancy Pelosi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=0.0s)]
*  She is Democrat of California. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=3.0s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=5.0s)]
*  I'm curious how you think about the message about this president and incumbency particular [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=6.2s)]
*  on that sort of central question that is always at the core of a re-election campaign for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=13.0s)]
*  any incumbent, particularly an incumbent president, of the, are you better off? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=19.8s)]
*  Have things gotten better? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=23.56s)]
*  Well, thank you for your presentation of the facts of our economy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=26.8s)]
*  Congratulations on your show. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=32.0s)]
*  And I'm honored to be once again on your first. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=34.4s)]
*  I was on the first when you started and now the first for this year, this election year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=36.68s)]
*  I always see things from the kitchen table. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=42.8s)]
*  And at the kitchen table we see, as you mentioned, wages are up, unemployment is down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=45.8s)]
*  What is also so is inflation is diminishing, even though it's a global phenomenon, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=52.24s)]
*  we compare well to other countries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=59.24s)]
*  But I also see the cost of, of course, affordable care, health care. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=62.24s)]
*  When you talk about four years ago and you see that the president at that time was in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=69.8s)]
*  denial, in delay, people lost their lives. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  He was fighting the Affordable Care Act. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=79.04s)]
*  He said he was going to repeal and replace. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=81.04s)]
*  He never came up with a plan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=84.64s)]
*  Now he says Obamacare sucks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=85.92s)]
*  Well, the fact is it is very high in public mind. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  And if you're at that kitchen table, the cost of health care is not only a health issue, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  it's a financial health issue as well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  And related to health is a woman's right to choose, because that's an economic issue, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  when you would have enlarged your family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  In terms of LGBTQ and everything, democracy and a fair economy are personal issues, are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  personal issues. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=118.44s)]
*  So we have to have clarity in how we put out these facts, and I appreciate what you did [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  say. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=125.52s)]
*  Also, the stock market is up, and when it was up, when, what's his name, was president, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=126.52s)]
*  he bragged about it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Because their husband's 401K is blah, blah, blah, and all that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=133.52s)]
*  The economy, the stock market is higher than it was when he was president. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=138.52s)]
*  So let's just take it to the kitchen table about people's health, financial well-being, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=143.4s)]
*  their freedom to live their lives, and again, the opportunity that Joe Biden has given them [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=150.12s)]
*  with unemployment, 15 million new jobs created. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=155.24s)]
*  And as you said, some in the manufacturing sector, productivity up. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=159.0s)]
*  This has been a remarkable story, and in a short period of time, most of that was done [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=164.36s)]
*  in the first two years with the Democratic Congress, says she immodestly, House and Senate, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=169.84s)]
*  with Joe Biden as our inspiration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=176.12s)]
*  One of the great ironies I want to ask you about, because we have this comparison, right, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=179.08s)]
*  four years, we're now in 2024, so, you know, are you better off four years? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=182.52s)]
*  One of the great ironies, I think, about 2020 when you look back is the CARES Act, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=186.72s)]
*  which was in some ways a remarkable piece of legislation, and largely, I have to say, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=192.68s)]
*  the work of you and Steve Mnuchin, basically. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=198.36s)]
*  I mean, it was a sort of, it was the House leadership under your stewardship and the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=204.0s)]
*  White House sort of tasked Steve Mnuchin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=209.24s)]
*  And one of the great ironies is that that legislation, which really reflected the Democratic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=210.76s)]
*  priorities of the House, ends up sort of being a thing that I think Donald Trump tried to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=216.32s)]
*  hang his hat on, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=221.8s)]
*  So there's this sort of great irony that a lot of what was done to kind of help the country [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=223.68s)]
*  in this moment of peril really embodied the priorities of your Democratic Party and was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=227.12s)]
*  used by Donald Trump in that election year, I suspect, well, again, as fodder for why [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=232.78s)]
*  he should get credit. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=236.84s)]
*  Well, in addition to the CARES Act, we had some follow-ups to it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=238.88s)]
*  And I want to commend Maxine Waters, Nidia Velazquez, in how businesses participated, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=244.88s)]
*  how diversity was represented and how the money was spent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=250.88s)]
*  And Maxine, if you could have heard Maxine and Nidia on the phone with Mnuchin, it was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=254.56s)]
*  something historic in terms of putting it out there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=260.08s)]
*  And also in terms of how the funds were distributed, the opportunity for access to whatever, whether [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=264.32s)]
*  it was a—would become one day a vaccine, but the measure of how this was affecting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=273.24s)]
*  our community. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=280.24s)]
*  So, again, it was the CARES Act plus, plus, plus, plus. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=281.24s)]
*  And it was bipartisan and made a difference. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=287.32s)]
*  But there was much more we needed to do that we couldn't do until President Biden took [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=291.46s)]
*  office and we had the rescue package, which really wrapped it up and drove it home in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=297.12s)]
*  terms of meeting the needs of cities and counties and state governments and the people [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=302.78s)]
*  who make our society work, whether it's transportation or healthcare, teachers or [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  food services. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that American rescue, the ARP and then the subsequent legislation, the Inflation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  Reduction Act. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=323.34s)]
*  I mean, again, this is like in the most basic sense of messaging. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=324.34s)]
*  You can almost, on a graph, the Inflation Reduction Act is basically passed at the moment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=328.74s)]
*  of highest inflation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=334.74s)]
*  Now, do I think that causally it is the case that the Inflation Reduction Act, which sort [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=335.74s)]
*  of was cheekily named in certain ways to get Joe Manchin on board, was what caused the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=340.7s)]
*  reduction of inflation? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=344.58s)]
*  No. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=345.58s)]
*  But again, the way this works is presidents take credit. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=346.58s)]
*  And it is the fact that the Democratic members of Congress and the president signed legislation [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=349.3s)]
*  called the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=354.44s)]
*  And if you look at the graph of inflation afterwards, it literally goes straight down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=356.16s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  And also there was deficit reduction, the reduction for the national debt in the legislation. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=363.06s)]
*  I remind that the rescue package, which was helped to create so many jobs and again support [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  our state and local governments, many of whose jobs are union jobs and many of which were [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=377.04s)]
*  women and minority union jobs, that's really important. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=385.16s)]
*  And also in the Inflation Reduction Act, not one Republican vote, not one in the rescue [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=389.0s)]
*  package and not one in the IRA. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=397.18s)]
*  It's in the IRA, if you've talked about some aspects of it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=400.16s)]
*  And of course it was the biggest bill to—law to help us fight the climate crisis. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=404.0s)]
*  But also in the bill was the reduction of the cost—for the first time, we were able [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=411.26s)]
*  to have the negotiation by the secretary of HHS to negotiate for lower-price prescription [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=417.06s)]
*  drugs for seniors. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=423.82s)]
*  And in the bill itself, it reduced the cost of Medicare for people with diabetes and the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=425.42s)]
*  arrest from $600 a month or $500 a month, depending, to $35 a month. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=434.98s)]
*  The Republicans have said they're going to overturn that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=443.92s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies are taking it to court. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=452.12s)]
*  Let's get back to that kitchen table. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=453.12s)]
*  Let's get back to that kitchen table. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  The cost of medicines and pharmaceuticals is very important in the bottom line of America's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  working families. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=463.8s)]
*  Having access to the Affordable Care Act is very important. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=464.86s)]
*  So again, there are aspects of these bills that have directly hit home for America's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=468.5s)]
*  families. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=476.44s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=477.44s)]
*  Joe Biden insisted upon it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=478.44s)]
*  We had been advocating these things for a long time and not having success with it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=481.02s)]
*  But he was making it a prior part of his vision, his knowledge of legislation and what has [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=486.32s)]
*  worked in the past and not his strategic thinking about how to legislate. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=493.44s)]
*  And that's all up here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=499.48s)]
*  And then in his heart, his love for the American people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=501.56s)]
*  He cares. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  And the empathy that he had for that kitchen table, the upbringing that he had, his understanding [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=506.48s)]
*  of America's working families. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=513.08s)]
*  So when we talk about this, we have to be trying to embrace everyone to make sure we're [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=515.86s)]
*  not fighting old fights. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=520.32s)]
*  What we're doing is making life better for them. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=521.9s)]
*  And that means ACA. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=526.26s)]
*  When we won in 2018, people said, weren't you lucky that the Affordable—that health [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=529.06s)]
*  care was such an important issue in the campaign? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=534.34s)]
*  I said, no, we weren't lucky. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=536.58s)]
*  We made our own luck. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=538.38s)]
*  We had 10,000 events to protect the Affordable Care Act from what the Trump administration [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=540.26s)]
*  and the Republicans were trying to do. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw0BF9Heu4&t=546.46s)]
