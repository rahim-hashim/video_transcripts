# ‘Big mad’: Trump is ‘emotional’ and ‘annoyed’ over trade war he started
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. Today the president of the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=0.0s)]
*  the man with the nuclear codes, is angry and emotional and acting frankly erratically. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=3.44s)]
*  And that is not my judgment. It's basically what his own cabinet defenders are saying. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=8.8s)]
*  The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this and so you go in a year [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=16.0s)]
*  back from someone who emotionally cares about America and why are Europeans picking on Kentucky [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=20.8s)]
*  or Harley Davidson motorcycles. So you're saying this is an emotional response? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=27.84s)]
*  It's disrespectful. He wants these countries to respect him and all this showed you is that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=31.92s)]
*  Europe and Canada do not respect Donald Trump. You know, if you make him unhappy he responds unhappy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=38.4s)]
*  I mean, points for honesty, he was totally annoyed. That's economic rationale. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=46.4s)]
*  That was Commerce Secretary and Trump whisperer Howard Lutnick explaining how the president is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=51.28s)]
*  just completely shocked that the trade war he launched out of nowhere for no reason against [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=56.72s)]
*  America's closest allies, Canada, the European Union is suddenly blowing up in his face and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=63.2s)]
*  threatening to tank the US economy. You might have seen today's stocks continued their impressively [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=67.92s)]
*  downward fall amid fears of higher prices from Trump's tariffs and threats and the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=73.28s)]
*  error of uncertainty that hangs over everything. The S&P 500 fell below 10% below its all-time high, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=78.32s)]
*  raising concerns among investors. A sell-off might be happening soon, although it looks like [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=84.56s)]
*  it's already happening. This Nasdaq is already in that worrying territory. The Dow Jones was on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=88.08s)]
*  track for its worst week since that string of high-profile bank failures in 2023. Again, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  all of this is happening not because banks failed or Russia invaded Ukraine or some huge macroeconomic [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=100.4s)]
*  structural thing happened. No, it's happening for literally no reason whatsoever other than Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=107.84s)]
*  picking a fight with our neighbors and our neighbors fighting back. And Trump is big mad about it, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=115.76s)]
*  throwing out new threats of massive tariffs and annexation of foreign territories in a vicious [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=122.08s)]
*  cycle of escalation. Yesterday, Canada and the EU responded to Trump's tariffs by imposing new taxes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=127.2s)]
*  on U.S. exports, including on signature American products like whiskey and motorcycles. When Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=134.32s)]
*  heard about that retaliation, he basically lost it and made this totally unhinged social media [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=140.88s)]
*  post in the middle of the night, quote, the European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=145.6s)]
*  taxing and tariffing authorities in the world, which is formed for the sole purpose of taking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% tariff on whiskey. If this tariff is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wine, champagne, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=161.76s)]
*  alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries. This will be great for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=166.88s)]
*  the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S. That was at 8 a.m. I should know. Now, U.S. does not [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  technically have any champagne businesses. We are the biggest market for champagne, many other [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=177.04s)]
*  French wines. Trump is threatening a tax at such a high level, the price of a bottle of wine would [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=182.32s)]
*  essentially double again for Americans, right? Americans are going to pay that. Everybody who [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=187.2s)]
*  understands trade understands this is insane. I think even people who don't understand trade [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=193.6s)]
*  understand this is insane. It was a point that even Emma Tucker, the editor of the very right wing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=199.04s)]
*  Wall Street Journal made this morning. That mood has shifted pretty much since all the tariff [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=204.64s)]
*  started coming in. I think businesses realize that Trump is serious about this, but the problem [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=212.48s)]
*  they've got is that they're being imposed in a very haphazard way and that's creating so much [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=217.92s)]
*  instability. When a company has to pay more for its input, will they typically pass it on to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=222.88s)]
*  to the consumer, do you think? I think eventually they're going to have to. Yeah. No, they eat it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=228.48s)]
*  An hour later, Trump posted again, I think he was watching, the globalist Wall Street Journal has no [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=239.04s)]
*  Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of screwing the United States of America. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=243.28s)]
*  I have to say this because we keep saying it. This is a theory of the EU's formation that is just like [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=248.88s)]
*  a thing as far as I can tell Trump invented three days ago. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni6A2sQnFE0&t=253.84s)]
