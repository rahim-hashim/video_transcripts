Video Description: “They’re basically telling him they’re likely to indictment him,” says George Conway on prosecutors reportedly sending Trump a target letter in the classified documents case. “If you are a believer in the rule of law, and have a hankering for the rule of law, Santa is going to come early this year—and it’s not going to be Christmas, it’s going to be sooner rather than later.”

# Conway: Trump reportedly receiving target letter suggests ‘imminent’ indictment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY)
*  George Conway is a conservative attorney and former Republican political operative. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Renato Marriottis is a former federal prosecutor, legal affairs columnist for Political Magazine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=4.24s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=8.88s)]
*  Renato, let me just start on you on sort of your top line kind of takeaway from the stack [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=9.88s)]
*  of these developments. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=16.2s)]
*  But the informing Trump that he's a target, the meeting that happened, this act of grand [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=17.56s)]
*  jury which seems to be doing still the kind of investigatory work you would expect not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=22.96s)]
*  the day before someone's indicted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=29.64s)]
*  What do you make of all of it together? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  So is a bottom line is if a prosecutor tells you that you are the target of their investigation, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=34.68s)]
*  it means they expect to indict you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=40.96s)]
*  When my clients now when I when I was on the other side of the aisle when I was a federal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=43.18s)]
*  prosecutor, that's when I told somebody that they were a target. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=47.36s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=50.6s)]
*  When I sent a target letter, it meant that an indictment was going to follow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=51.64s)]
*  And if one of my clients is the target letter now, that's what I tell them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=55.36s)]
*  You need to prepare for an indictment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=59.28s)]
*  Expect that that's going to happen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=60.88s)]
*  And we actively start preparing for that to happen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=62.8s)]
*  So that's big news. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=65.28s)]
*  And then regarding the fact that witnesses are coming in, what that tells me is it's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=67.52s)]
*  not happening like tomorrow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=71.12s)]
*  I know there's a lot of smoking around that and maybe it'll happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=72.6s)]
*  But generally speaking, if witnesses are going before the grand jury this week, like in today, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=77.28s)]
*  one witness you mentioned is going in a Trump spokesman. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=83.2s)]
*  That suggests to me that an indictment is not happening tomorrow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  They're going to be absorbing that testimony, including that in some of their paperwork, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=89.84s)]
*  sending an indictment over to Merrick Garland for his review. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=95.28s)]
*  I would expect an indictment not to be happening in, let's say, a matter of a few days, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  maybe next week, a week after, or even further from that as they make decisions regarding [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=103.56s)]
*  the scope of indictments at which venues to bring them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=109.56s)]
*  George, what are your thoughts? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=112.28s)]
*  Yeah, I basically agree with that and I agree with your excellent summary of what's going on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=116.12s)]
*  I mean, I think the word that you could use here that was probably and advisably used [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=120.2s)]
*  in the Georgia investigation is that an indictment is imminent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=126.04s)]
*  I mean, I think it's highly, I mean, they're basically telling him they're likely to indict [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=129.8s)]
*  him, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be tomorrow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=134.36s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean that next week. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=137.32s)]
*  But it does mean that if you are a believer in the rule of law and a hankering for the rule of law, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=139.16s)]
*  the Santa's going to come early this year and it's not going to be in Christmas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=144.12s)]
*  It's going to be sooner rather than later. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=147.4s)]
*  But, you know, we don't know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=149.48s)]
*  It's just rampant speculation that it could be tomorrow or the day after, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=151.24s)]
*  at 11 o'clock tomorrow or next Thursday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=154.6s)]
*  But it's very just clear, given all the indications which you laid out nicely, Chris, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=158.6s)]
*  that we're at the end, we're reaching the end stages of the investigation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=163.08s)]
*  The fact that so many leaks are coming out now is a function of the fact that so many people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=167.64s)]
*  know what's going on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=172.84s)]
*  Everything except the timing, because the defense lawyers are all sharing information [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  about witnesses who have gone into the grand jury or talked to the FBI. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=178.76s)]
*  And it's just a flood of information that's coming out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=182.28s)]
*  And now, I guess in Trump world, the word has gotten out that the target letter [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  has been received and that's, you know, it's seeping out into the press. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  I want to just- [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the end stages of an investigation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=195.88s)]
*  I just want to stress what you said there because I think that's actually important, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=197.48s)]
*  because one of the weird things, right, is that is like the tempo of information. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=199.8s)]
*  So why are we learning so much? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=203.32s)]
*  And to your point there, I think you're right about that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=204.68s)]
*  It's sort of from my point as a journalist, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=206.84s)]
*  Yeah, basically, the more people that know something, it's just- [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=210.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=213.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=214.44s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people now know a lot about what's going on, but not everything. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=217.72s)]
*  And there's a lot that we don't know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=221.88s)]
*  Renaud, go ahead. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=224.68s)]
*  No, I was just going to say, I don't know if Santa's bringing coal this year, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=227.08s)]
*  if someone's been a very bad boy or not. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=229.88s)]
*  But I do think what is happening now is there are certain facts that are known, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=232.28s)]
*  So we know about a meeting that occurred. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=238.52s)]
*  We saw his attorneys outside. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=240.92s)]
*  There's major reporting about that that usually is at the end of an investigation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=243.32s)]
*  We know there's a target letter. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=247.88s)]
*  That is, I think, very substantial. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=249.72s)]
*  That's a very, very clear sign that Trump is going to be indicted in this investigation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of the rest of what we're hearing are echoes of assumptions that people are making [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=259.8s)]
*  and their own understanding of events. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  In other words, reporters are hearing from Trump's lawyers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  all sorts of theories and ideas about what's happening. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=270.44s)]
*  They're not hearing from Jack Smith, the guy that we rarely catch on video. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  NBC reporter might catch him very, you know, when he's on his way back from Subway. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=278.68s)]
*  What we're really getting is these faint echoes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=284.76s)]
*  But I do think, as George said, it's really coming to a head right now, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=287.48s)]
*  and that's the important point. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=293.16s)]
*  George, let me ask you about this venue issue. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  I know no one has any, again, special insight into this to stress what Renaud just said, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  But we do know that there is this grand jury in Florida. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=303.0s)]
*  It appears to be fairly new. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=306.44s)]
*  And I think the informed speculation about that is that you want to avoid venue problems, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=309.24s)]
*  that if you indict them in Washington on events that happen specifically in Florida, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=314.44s)]
*  you could be setting yourself up for venue challenges. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=318.76s)]
*  Those venue challenges could be difficult. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=321.72s)]
*  They could hand some sort of tool to the defense. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=323.48s)]
*  I'm just curious your thoughts on that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, the Sixth Amendment provides that the criminal defendant in the criminal case [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  is entitled to a jury from the state and the district in which the alleged crime was committed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=335.24s)]
*  And that's the bottom principle. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, how that's applied depends on the particular facts of the case, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=342.68s)]
*  of a particular case, as we don't know all the facts here, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=345.88s)]
*  but we know a lot of the facts, a lot of the things that were bad occurred in Florida, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=348.76s)]
*  although some of the bad things were directed at an investigation [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=353.08s)]
*  that was being conducted from Washington. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=357.08s)]
*  And there is not, just because the Constitution has clear words on it, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=359.32s)]
*  doesn't mean that the case law is necessarily that clear as it applies specific statutes [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=363.72s)]
*  and specific factual scenarios. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=367.8s)]
*  And as I understand it, the law isn't necessarily uniform from district to district. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=371.0s)]
*  So they're going to try to minimize the risk of having an indictment bounced [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  by bringing, you know, taking their best shot where they think it most likely is to stick. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  And given the amount of activity that went on in Florida, bad activity, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  it's not surprising that they have a grand jury going there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=389.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's well said. George Conway, Renato Mariotti. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=392.2s)]
*  Thank you both, gentlemen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyT_Tw1CuKY&t=394.76s)]
