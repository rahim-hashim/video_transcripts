# Ex-Fulton County prosecutor breaks down potential charges in Trump case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM)
*  So, if one indictment watch wasn't enough for all of you, we are also waiting for indictment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=0.0s)]
*  news from the state of Georgia, where there could be potential criminal charges on the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=5.32s)]
*  state level against the ex-president for his efforts to overturn the election as early [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=9.4s)]
*  as next month. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=14.0s)]
*  Now, if you don't remember all the details of this investigation, I'm going to remind [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=15.0s)]
*  you, because, in support, you know them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=18.68s)]
*  This infamous one-hour phone call Trump had with Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=20.5s)]
*  also serves as a friendly reminder of what this is all about. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=25.96s)]
*  So, look, all I want to do is this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=30.52s)]
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=33.6s)]
*  state, and flipping the state is a great testament to our country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=44.96s)]
*  And a lot of work has happened under Fonny Willis since that call. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=51.44s)]
*  Fonny Willis opened the investigation back in February of 2021, and the grand jury has [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=57.48s)]
*  been hearing evidence for the past seven months. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=61.64s)]
*  Back in May, Willis instructed her staff to work remotely for a good chunk of the first [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=64.28s)]
*  three weeks of August. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=69.16s)]
*  Remember, August is coming up next week. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  She even asked judges in Atlanta to not schedule trials during that time period. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=73.0s)]
*  Last week, The Guardian reported that the district attorney has developed evidence [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=77.52s)]
*  to bring racketeering charges in the case, a charge we all usually associate with the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=80.8s)]
*  mob. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  And today, the paper reports that Willis is weighing charges, including, quote, solicitation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=86.68s)]
*  to commit election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud, end quote, solicitation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=91.28s)]
*  of a public officer to fail to perform duties and solicitation to destroy, deface or remove [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=96.84s)]
*  ballots, according to two people briefed on the matter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=102.84s)]
*  I should note NBC News has not confirmed either of those Guardian reports. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Tanya Miller served as a Fulton County prosecutor and is now a Democratic state representative [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  in Georgia, and she joins me now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=114.48s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time this evening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=116.36s)]
*  I have so many questions for you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to start. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=120.32s)]
*  First of all, The Guardian is reporting that D.A. Willis is considering charges that include, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  quote, solicitation to commit election fraud, conspiracy to commit election fraud, solicitation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=126.28s)]
*  of a public officer to fail to perform duties and solicitation to destroy, deface or remove [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=131.32s)]
*  ballots. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=136.12s)]
*  Can you explain to us non-lawyers what that means and how they might apply to Trump himself? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=137.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=143.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=144.44s)]
*  So the first thing I think your listeners need to know about kind of how prosecutors [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=145.44s)]
*  approach charging decisions, particularly in Fulton County. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=150.36s)]
*  I was a prosecutor in Fulton County with Madame D.A. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=153.56s)]
*  Fondy Willis for many years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=156.44s)]
*  And of course, we are taught and trained to charge the highest charge that we believe [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  the evidence will support. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=163.88s)]
*  All of these charges essentially are centered around this idea that the former president [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=166.72s)]
*  sought to interfere with our election by getting folks who were stakeholders in our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  election process to tip the scale in his favor. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=179.88s)]
*  So when you solicit someone to commit a crime, you try to get them to commit the crime for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  If you conspire with someone to commit a crime, it means that you have agreed, whether it's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  an explicit agreement or a tacit agreement, that you all are going to commit a crime together. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=195.2s)]
*  In Georgia, you can do any of those things, particularly under the RICO statute. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=201.6s)]
*  Solicit someone to commit crimes or conspire with someone to commit crimes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=207.04s)]
*  And it can land you, unfortunately, before a petit jury in Fulton County if you do any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  of that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  So one of the reports that was out last week was that he could also be charged with racketeering, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  which again sounds a little bit like something the mob does. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=226.72s)]
*  I had this question about whether all of those charges listed in the reporting today could [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=229.56s)]
*  be under racketeering or was your expectation that it would be separate charges? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=233.4s)]
*  Well, of course, you know, most prosecutors will do both, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=237.68s)]
*  So they will charge predicate acts that are all essentially a predicate act is a crime [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=242.88s)]
*  in and of itself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  So racketeering just means that you commit multiple crimes in furtherance of some scheme [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=249.96s)]
*  or enterprise. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=256.24s)]
*  So a crime as an enterprise can be just a collection of folks who are working together [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  for a purpose, legitimate or illegitimate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=261.36s)]
*  And if you commit crimes in connection with that purpose, legitimate or illegitimate, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=264.0s)]
*  it can be RICO. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=269.0s)]
*  So all of these crimes can be charged individually by themselves. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=270.52s)]
*  All of them can also be predicates under the RICO Act. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=274.72s)]
*  So prosecutors kind of can get you can get you both ways. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=278.44s)]
*  I want to come to your law school class. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=282.12s)]
*  It seems like from this reporting and from what we know about the Georgia case, there's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=284.8s)]
*  a lot of overlap with what Jack Smith is looking into. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=289.12s)]
*  Is it safe to say or should we assume that Fonning Willis is sharing information with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=293.04s)]
*  Jack Smith's team back and forth? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, I think that's really almost on a case by case basis. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=299.48s)]
*  So you'd be surprised to know that that some prosecutors offices work very well together. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=305.16s)]
*  They share information pretty, pretty freely. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=310.32s)]
*  And some prosecutors offices don't. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  So I guess it would really depend on the nature of the relationship between those two offices, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  the trust that they have with each other, that the other office will protect the integrity [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=322.36s)]
*  of the investigation, each other's respective investigation, that there aren't leaks that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=326.6s)]
*  might compromise the investigation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=331.2s)]
*  But I would say to you that in the spirit of prosecuting a person who is suspected of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=333.92s)]
*  committing crimes across various states, it is not uncommon to see prosecutors in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=340.84s)]
*  all of those jurisdictions work together to help each other to accomplish a similar goal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=346.56s)]
*  And that is to to hold accountable someone that they believe they have sufficient evidence [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=351.88s)]
*  to show is committing crimes across the state. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  So they could be sharing it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=359.32s)]
*  There's no law against it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=360.64s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=362.08s)]
*  Maybe we'll learn at some point. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  Tanya Miller, thank you so much for your time explaining all of the legal components to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=364.67999999999995s)]
*  me and all of our viewers tonight. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0BiW3djeM&t=369.72s)]
