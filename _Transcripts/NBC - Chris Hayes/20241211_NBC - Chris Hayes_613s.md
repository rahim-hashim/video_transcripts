# Ayman: Why did it take this long for Assad’s regime in Syria to collapse?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0)
*  It has been 72 hours since Bashar al-Assad and his regime in Syria came to an abrupt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=0.0s)]
*  end when rebel forces captured Damascus, forcing him to flee to Moscow. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=6.12s)]
*  And it has been a long time coming. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  The uprising in Syria started peacefully in March of 2011, nearly 13 years ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But when the Assad regime brutally cracked down on it, it led to militancy and a civil [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=17.96s)]
*  war that tore up the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=23.02s)]
*  I covered it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=25.36s)]
*  I went there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=26.36s)]
*  Nearly a year into Assad's crackdown, I traveled to Daraa, the heart of the uprising for NBC [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=27.72s)]
*  News, and I saw firsthand how the Assad regime treated people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=33.2s)]
*  Even on this busy street, people wouldn't speak to us, saying it was too dangerous. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=38.92s)]
*  But others off-camera told us what life is really like. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=43.6s)]
*  This man leads us away from government minders and into a narrow alley. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=47.32s)]
*  We promise not to show his face. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=51.44s)]
*  He shows us gunshot wounds suffered during the protests and tells us a different story [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=53.84s)]
*  than what government officials have been saying. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  To be honest, part of me, like many others, still can't believe that Bashar al-Assad was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  actually toppled after so long. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=65.80000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, it is worth looking back and asking a different question. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=68.30000000000001s)]
*  Why didn't this happen sooner? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Why did it take this long for the Assad regime to collapse? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Why did the world let it go on for so long? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=77.44s)]
*  Back in 2012, a year into the uprising, then-President Barack Obama gave this famous warning to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=80.96s)]
*  the Assad regime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=86.32s)]
*  We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  being utilized. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=105.28s)]
*  When Assad crossed that red line and actually used chemical weapons on civilians in 2013, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  President Obama changed course and sought to get approval from Congress for a military [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=113.36s)]
*  strike in Syria. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  He was ultimately met with bipartisan opposition in Congress with members saying that the war [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=119.28s)]
*  in Syria did not pose a threat to the United States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=123.64s)]
*  In the UK, then-Prime Minister David Cameron similarly went to the British House of Commons [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  to make his case for authorizing force against Assad's regime for their use of chemical [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=131.68s)]
*  weapons. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=136.28s)]
*  But this resolution failed, 272 to 285, with votes from members of Cameron's own conservative [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=137.56s)]
*  party. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=142.84s)]
*  With the U.S. sideline, the failure to enforce a red line against Syria arguably gave Russia, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=143.84s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah a green light to fill the void and drag the civil war into a very different [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=148.68s)]
*  direction. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=154.84s)]
*  Which brings us to today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=155.84s)]
*  Here we are at a crossroads once again where wrong decisions are being made in the Middle [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=158.28s)]
*  East in real time, this time by America's closest ally in the region, Israel, against [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=162.36s)]
*  a nascent Syrian government still taking shape. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=168.28s)]
*  Since Assad's collapse, Israel has launched a sweeping aerial campaign and ground invasion [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=171.8s)]
*  with at least 350 airstrikes being leveled against military assets across Syria, taking [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  out the Navy, fighter jets, drones, tanks, air defense systems, weapons plants and a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  wide array of missiles and rockets, according to the Israeli military. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=188.68s)]
*  Now presumably, the new Syrian government that wants to preserve its territorial sovereignty [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=192.76s)]
*  and security is probably going to want some of those military assets to maintain control [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=197.6s)]
*  of its countries and borders, will it not? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=203.04s)]
*  In addition to the airstrikes, Israel has now launched a ground incursion into Syria [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=205.74s)]
*  and illegally seized and now occupied territory. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel claims it is doing so temporarily and preemptively in self-defense. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=213.72s)]
*  But decades ago, Israel illegally occupied Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=218.96s)]
*  Land, it would go on to illegally annex till this very same day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=223.48s)]
*  Now think about this, America's closest ally in the region is bombing Syria heavily without [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=228.28s)]
*  any consequence and effectively weakening and defanging a state that we here in America [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=232.78s)]
*  want to succeed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=238.28s)]
*  That we want to be sovereign and independent and free of foreign interferences, whether [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=239.86s)]
*  that is from Iran or Russia. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  How long is the new government in Syria going to simply sit by and watch Israel launch strikes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=247.58s)]
*  against them and take more land? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=253.9s)]
*  What is the advantage of doing this other than defeating and weakening a state that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=256.14s)]
*  is reeling for more than a decade of civil war? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=260.74s)]
*  How does a weak Syria that cannot even secure its own borders, defend its territory, benefit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=263.54s)]
*  America's national security interests? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=269.72s)]
*  Here's what the UN Special Envoy for Syria had to say about that earlier today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=277.48s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=286.48s)]
*  Joining me now is Samer Ali, Professor of Political Science and Law at Vanderbilt University. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=288.48s)]
*  Samer, it's great to see you again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=293.6s)]
*  Let's start with the strikes and incursions that we are seeing in Syria from Israel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=295.16s)]
*  The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told NBC News that Israel does [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=301.24s)]
*  not intend to stay in Syria permanently, but will not allow the Iranians to return to their [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=304.68s)]
*  borders. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  You and I know, obviously, till this day, Israel occupies the Golan Heights illegally [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  against international law. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  Could this be the beginning of something similar? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=320.54s)]
*  It could be. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=324.88s)]
*  I think we have a lot of could-be's. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=325.88s)]
*  There's a lot of scenarios to explore right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=327.28s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are live and in action. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=329.52s)]
*  It's a very dynamic environment that we're all witnessing in real time, as you said as [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=331.88s)]
*  well, like you're still wrapping your head around the fact that Assad is no longer in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  power after all of this time, and the Assad regime has fallen after over 50 years of ruling. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=339.68s)]
*  And I think that we need to go back to basics here, and we need to think about what does [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  a rules-based international order actually look like? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=350.68s)]
*  We do not want to see a sovereign state like Syria being attacked by any state right now, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  whether that be Israel, whether that be Turkey, whether that be Iran, whether that be Russia. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel has attacked, as we know, and it has attacked over 150 times over the past 24 hours. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=366.64s)]
*  And as you mentioned as well, what does — whose interest does a weak Syria serve? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=373.32s)]
*  It certainly doesn't serve the United States' interest. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=378.0s)]
*  It doesn't serve many democratic nations' interests. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=380.32s)]
*  It doesn't serve, again, an international order, if that is what our interests are. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=382.48s)]
*  We know that Syria is of a strategic interest in the region, and a strong, stable Syria [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  will be good for the entire Arab world, and quite frankly, it will be good for the entire [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=395.8s)]
*  world. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  So we need to invest in those steps that are going to lead to a stable, strong Syria rather [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  than an unstable, weak Syria. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=408.04s)]
*  And keep this in mind, too. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=409.88s)]
*  Violence breeds more violence. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=412.67999999999995s)]
*  What really concerns me, too, is if Israel goes in and starts annexing land or starts [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=414.28s)]
*  creating a further destabilizing environment, that can also invite more and other countries [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=421.32s)]
*  to do the same, and we're going to have another proxy war in Syria instead of what the Syrian [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=427.58s)]
*  people are calling for, which is peace, which is unity, and which is consistent with our [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  own interest around human rights and democratic values. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=438.64s)]
*  Let me get your thoughts on other developments involving Syria. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=442.8s)]
*  This from the White House. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  Two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  today that the Biden administration is exploring removing the foreign terrorist designation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  for HTS, the most powerful of the rebel groups that unseated Bashar al-Assad. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you make of this development, and what could it mean for Syria? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it a good or positive step to do so? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=465.46s)]
*  I think it is a positive step to do so, and I think it's, again, the United States showing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=469.64s)]
*  an interest in a stable, strong Syria, one which has indicated it wants to rebuild. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=473.64s)]
*  It is crying out and saying no to more violence. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=479.08s)]
*  It's saying enough. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=482.88s)]
*  It's saying we—essentially, it's saying to the world, we want peace. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=484.36s)]
*  We want to break the cycle of violence. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=488.28s)]
*  We want to break the cycle of trauma. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=489.96s)]
*  And what we're interested in is the world believing in us as we are believing in ourselves, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=492.08s)]
*  and we want you to invest in us. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=496.52s)]
*  We want to become open for business. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=498.16s)]
*  We want a different tomorrow than what our dark past over the past at least half century [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=500.04s)]
*  has looked like, and that requires removing the sanctions. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=504.68s)]
*  It requires different designations for different groups, which have shown and continue to prove [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=507.44s)]
*  that they have evolved and they don't want violence, that they want peace, they want [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=512.44s)]
*  to join the rest of the world and to seek for freedom, for prosperity, for a better [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=516.36s)]
*  tomorrow for their children. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=521.66s)]
*  And what this requires, I'll just say three things. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=523.28s)]
*  And I think that this is what we want to help invest in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=525.2s)]
*  We want to invest in the stability rather than in an escalation of more violence. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=527.4s)]
*  And that stabilizing process, which is critical during a transition, which is what we're [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  in right now, is the following. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=535.36s)]
*  They need to establish a credible transitional authority, a transitional government that's [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=537.56s)]
*  going to govern between during this transitional period. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  The second thing that needs to happen is they need to establish a constitutional declaration [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  of principles that's going to guide this period as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=551.16s)]
*  And the third thing, which is really critically important and time sensitive, is they need [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=554.12s)]
*  to act and show their ability to deliver in ways that allow for international aid to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=558.32s)]
*  be able to come in, for the currency to be stabilized, for the economy to be open for [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=564.08s)]
*  business again, and to start showing some wins and getting some positive scores on [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=568.6s)]
*  the scoreboard that peace is possible and peace is delivering and that violence is not [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=572.5200000000001s)]
*  inevitable and that there's another path here than violence. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=577.72s)]
*  And that also requires stability on the streets and to manage a de-escalation process so [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=581.16s)]
*  that we don't see a lot of chaos, which is what we contend to see during a transitional period. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3iAFZ2u0&t=587.44s)]
