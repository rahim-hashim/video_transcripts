# A 'raging misogynist' and a recent high school grad: The men running the Trump-Musk government
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g)
*  Donald Trump is in the process of staffing up his second administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=0.0s)]
*  It seems prudent to take a look at some of the men who will be running the government [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=4.0s)]
*  this time around. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=7.88s)]
*  For instance, this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tapped a guy named Darren Beatty, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=9.44s)]
*  that's him there, to serve as the acting Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, communicating [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=13.56s)]
*  publicly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Today, Rubio praised Beatty and said he has another nominee in mind for the permanent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  position, which requires Senate confirmation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=23.56s)]
*  That could be because, as NBC News reports, Beatty has a history of making inflammatory [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=26.56s)]
*  remarks, including a post on X in October of just last year, that said, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=31.2s)]
*  competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=35.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=38.8s)]
*  women and minorities and demoralizing competent white men. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=44.16s)]
*  Now, Beatty actually worked for Trump the first time around as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  NBC News reports that Beatty was fired from the Trump White House in 2018. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  After it emerged, he'd appeared at a conference with white nationalists in 2016. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=55.56s)]
*  He told the Washington Post he'd said nothing objectionable and that he stood by his remarks [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=59.84s)]
*  completely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Beatty is also a January 6th truther, who is one of the authors of the baseless conspiracy [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=64.44s)]
*  theory that the entire attack was essentially a false flag planned by the FBI. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  As the Washington Post reported in 2023, he was the first person to draw major attention [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=74.36s)]
*  to a guy named Ray Epps, who was at the Capitol on January 6th, and who conspiracy theorists [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=78.76s)]
*  baselessly claimed was a Fed tasked with inciting the attack. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=83.64s)]
*  Epps later sued Fox News for repeating that claim in a suit that was dismissed shortly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=87.68s)]
*  after Trump won election in November. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  A year after the insurrection, Trump congratulated Beatty by name for exposing so much of the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=94.44s)]
*  fake news false narrative about January 6th. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=99.2s)]
*  Also at the State Department is a guy named Pete Morocco, who Rubio tapped to run USAID [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=103.0s)]
*  after Elon Musk basically decided the State Department will run the formerly independent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=108.84s)]
*  agency. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=112.92s)]
*  According to NBC News in early 2023, online sleuths who aided the FBI in cases against [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=114.12s)]
*  hundreds of January 6th rioters identified Morocco and his now wife as being among the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=119.64s)]
*  rioters who stormed the Capitol in 2021, pointing to multiple images of them on its [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Capitol grounds that day and CCTV video that shows the man they identified as Morocco entering [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=130.2s)]
*  the Capitol through a broken window. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=136.48s)]
*  The sleuths said. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=139.12s)]
*  Morocco was never charged with a crime. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=147.56s)]
*  He did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  When another outlet asked him about it last year, Morocco did not directly address if [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=152.8s)]
*  he was at the Capitol as part of the insurrection, but did decry, quote, petty smear tactics [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=156.36s)]
*  and desperate personal attacks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=161.56s)]
*  Now, over the Office of Personnel Management, the agency that oversees all U.S. government [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=163.52s)]
*  personnel, the new general counsel, basically the government's top H.R. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=168.84s)]
*  lawyer, is that guy, a guy named Andrew Kloster. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=173.36s)]
*  As the Associated Press reports, during the 2020 election, Kloster worked as an observer [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=177.04s)]
*  for the Wisconsin Republican Party on election night and was accused of yelling at election [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=182.16s)]
*  workers and police in Green Bay, a claim he disputes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  The Daily Beast did a deep dive into Kloster back in 2023 when he was hired by then Republican [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=191.44s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=197.84s)]
*  According to the report, Kloster has a history of making inflammatory social media posts [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=199.84s)]
*  and then deleting them, including one where he called himself a raging misogynist, another [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  where he said, you know what I need? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=210.52s)]
*  I need a woman who looks like she got punched. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  A third where he suggested slaves owe us reparations. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  Daily Beast also uncovered a comment reportedly from Kloster on a libertarian blog post about [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=220.36s)]
*  bestiality from 2012 titled Government Out of Bedrooms, But Into Barnyards, reading, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=225.52s)]
*  consent is probably modern society's most pernicious fetish. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=232.4s)]
*  Kloster did not respond to the Daily Beast's request for comment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=237.88s)]
*  OPM has also found itself infiltrated by at least one of Elon Musk's very young acolytes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=241.36s)]
*  Wired uncovered a number of these young men, including a 19-year-old named Edward Koresstein, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=248.0s)]
*  who appears to have recently graduated from high school and to have been enrolled at Northeastern [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=255.12s)]
*  University. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=259.36s)]
*  Koresstein and another young man are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by Wired [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=260.64s)]
*  as experts at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=265.16s)]
*  What's more, employees at the Government Services Administration tell Wired that Koresstein [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=270.56s)]
*  has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=274.88s)]
*  their jobs to the college freshmen. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=280.44s)]
*  Koresstein did not respond to a request for comment from Wired, nor did OPM. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=283.56s)]
*  Seems like a recent high school graduate is determining whether career civil servants [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=288.16s)]
*  have sufficiently justified their jobs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=292.92s)]
*  These are just some of the men running your government under Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yL3wQpzI-g&t=296.12s)]
