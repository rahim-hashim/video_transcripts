# ‘Great realignment’ Are Never-Trump Republicans actually just Democrats now?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE)
*  Fox News has contributed to what is happening, which is basically the alienation of a key [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=0.0s)]
*  constituency in American politics, what we used to call moderate Republicans, swing voters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=5.88s)]
*  who were once persuadable, but a lot of them have just now become basically Democrats. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=11.68s)]
*  That is the thesis of a new piece by Ben Jacobs in the New Republic, Are Never Trumpers Actually [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=17.52s)]
*  Just Democrats Now? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=22.2s)]
*  And the author of that piece, Ben Jacobs, joins me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=24.18s)]
*  Ben, I really enjoyed the piece and I was reading it thinking of what we were talking [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=27.6s)]
*  about special elections yesterday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  What's your basic thesis to the piece? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=32.24s)]
*  The basic thesis is that Donald Trump has provoked this great realignment in American [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=35.2s)]
*  politics that for all the attention we spent after 2016 going to the, you know, mythical [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=39.18s)]
*  Rust Belt diners in Ohio and Pennsylvania where there are Obama Trump voters, there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=44.84s)]
*  are a lot of now Romney Biden voters in the suburbs in places like outside Phoenix, outside [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Atlanta, and that if you go to the Lululemons, if you go to the Whole Foods there, there [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=54.96s)]
*  are a lot of people who were once, you know, traditional country club Republicans who are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=58.6s)]
*  now voting for Democrats in most races, not all races, but certainly for president, for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  U.S. Senate, as we've seen in Georgia, in Arizona, and starting to move down ballot [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=70.8s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=75.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is what's key, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=76.76s)]
*  So we've known that there are these swing voters. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=77.92s)]
*  But one of the things you say is the endurance of never Trump Republicans means that a not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=80.28s)]
*  insignificant number of George W. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=83.92s)]
*  Bush and Mitt Romney voters from pundits on down to suburban parents are now part of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  Democratic base and participating in party primaries. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=90.12s)]
*  What you're saying is it's not just the voting behavior. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=93.24s)]
*  It's actually like a deeper partisan association affiliation that's happening. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=95.84s)]
*  Like these people are becoming Democrats, self-identified, their voting behavior, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=100.12s)]
*  even to a certain extent how they might start seeing issues. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=105.84s)]
*  Yes, that's precisely right, you know, that in you're seeing this impact in data that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  the voters who are leaving the Republican Party are more likely to be pro-choice, they're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  more likely to be pro-immigration reform, and that you're seeing this sort of rearrangement [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=118.56s)]
*  of the parties, that these voters are also disproportionately well-educated, and that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=123.76s)]
*  you're seeing a re-sorting of these voters as they approach these issues, and as Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=128.32s)]
*  Trump in particular, you know, has become this sort of repellent figure. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=132.96s)]
*  And some of this was happening already, that this is the analogy I use that there's sort [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=137.12s)]
*  of tectonic forces, that there's this low steady shift, that some of these areas were [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=140.9s)]
*  creeping slowly towards Democrats, but Donald Trump just put it on steroids in the same [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  way that the upper Midwest, parts of the upper Midwest, have gone towards Republicans in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=149.88s)]
*  the past decade. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=153.88s)]
*  These prosperous, well-educated suburban areas have really zoomed in the other direction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=155.4s)]
*  What do you think it means for the political fortunes of the two coalitions, and what [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=160.84s)]
*  did you hear from folks when you went and reported this out? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=164.68s)]
*  What it means for the political coalitions is that you're now starting to have this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  sort of much stronger cultural divide, that the cleavages are based on education, the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  cleavages are based on some of the social issues we're seeing, and that it really creates [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=177.6s)]
*  this sort of new divide in terms of the parties that traditionally, you know, you think about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=181.84s)]
*  special elections, that lower turnout elections traditionally were supposed to favor Republicans, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=188.68s)]
*  because Republican voters were traditionally more affluent, better educated and more likely [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=194.4s)]
*  to vote in Democrats you needed to persuade. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=198.0s)]
*  As the coalitions have shifted, Democrats are performing better in midterms, performing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=200.44s)]
*  better in special elections, because they are now more of the high-propensity voters. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=204.16s)]
*  And you have the shift in—voters, they're still in between that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=210.12s)]
*  There are examples in the articles of folks who are frustrated with Trump, frustrated [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=213.16s)]
*  with—you know, some of them are frustrated with Biden, and there's still sort of this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=217.52s)]
*  to which, you know, this is not a clear conversion, that this is not an issue in which you have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=221.84s)]
*  voters who have suddenly flipped on a switch because they're repelled by Trump, that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  you have—in the area I went to, a lot of people voted for Joe Biden, who voted for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=230.72s)]
*  Raphael Warnock in the Senate race, then also voted for Republican Brian Kemp for governor [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=235.08s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=239.4s)]
*  And that, you know, they're looking for normal Republicans, and if they're crazy [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=240.4s)]
*  Republicans, they're going straight Democrat. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is interesting. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to just linger on this for a moment, because it's something I'm sort of obsessed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=249.4s)]
*  with. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=252.76s)]
*  For as long as I've covered politics, the belief is higher turnout helps Democrats, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=253.76s)]
*  right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=258.84s)]
*  That Democrats have a higher percentage of sort of lower-propensity voters, that they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=259.84s)]
*  have the harder time turning folks out, the Republicans have higher-propensity voters, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=263.2s)]
*  the ones that show up for midterms, and that's why you got 94, and that's why you got 2010. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=267.92s)]
*  The changing nature of the coalitions is changing that, and we're seeing it in these special [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=273.08s)]
*  elections. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=278.0s)]
*  I also think it's really interesting, because you get to this point where you're sort of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=279.0s)]
*  – you've got an interesting tension between one's principles and what might be best. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=282.32s)]
*  So like in Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro just introduced automatic voter registration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=287.4s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=291.28s)]
*  I support that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=292.7s)]
*  I want people to vote, no matter which party it helps. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=293.7s)]
*  But the idea that high levels of turnout automatically help Democrats just might not be born out [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=297.48s)]
*  And it might also make Republicans start to rethink what they've been doing in stopping [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  people from going to the ballot box. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  That's certainly a possibility, but it's also so much of this has become tribal, that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=312.16s)]
*  so much of these attitudes are rooted in tribalism, that there's so much of this is about cultural [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  signifiers and that that's become part of this, too, that if you think about how much [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=321.04s)]
*  Donald Trump has changed politics, which is part of this, is that just about everything [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=325.72s)]
*  What beer you drink, what sports you watch is political, and that some of this is not [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=329.92s)]
*  about sort of the broader electoral logic, but there's a symbolism there that we've [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=335.48s)]
*  seen in politics throughout, which is part of the reason why Brian Kemp won, that it [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=340.24s)]
*  wasn't that Brian Kemp was a liberal Republican. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=344.48s)]
*  No one would confuse him with the Syrian communist, Nelson Rockefeller. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  But because he broke with Trump on the elections and because of the stylistic differences, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=350.76s)]
*  he was perceived as more moderate, and that made the difference and that helped Republicans [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=355.1s)]
*  down the ticket, too, that all the state Republicans that you had Trump endorsing election deniers [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=359.86s)]
*  who benefited from the same wave as you did Brad Raffensperger, who testified before the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=364.14s)]
*  January 6th committee and won the key figures in stopping the efforts to overturn the election, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=368.46s)]
*  that it creates this branding and this cultural signifiers that's more than the policy nuances. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=372.98s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=379.82s)]
*  It's a great piece in the New Republic by Ben Jacobs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=380.82s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxgTardP8YE&t=382.54s)]
