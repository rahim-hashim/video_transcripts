# ‘Laughable’: AOC blasts GOP’s ‘craven’ bid to impeach DHS Secretary
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU)
*  One of the challenges President Joe Biden faces in our current information environment, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=0.0s)]
*  and a Donald Trump media environment in particular, is how to communicate [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=3.92s)]
*  just how much this administration, Democrats in Congress, have actually gotten done. It's been a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=7.28s)]
*  lot. For example, the last two years have been the most productive years for U.S. climate efforts [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=10.8s)]
*  ever. We are still not on trajectory to meet our Paris climate targets, but for the first time, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=16.32s)]
*  it actually seems like we have a shot at making it almost entirely thanks to the Inflation and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=22.0s)]
*  Reduction Act passed without a single Republican vote. One of the people who first championed the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=27.04s)]
*  early version of the climate plan as the Green Dune Deal is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=32.08s)]
*  Democrat in New York, and she joins me now. Congresswoman, it's great to have you on. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  One of the things that I encounter, I think, particularly in social media dominated spaces, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=41.6s)]
*  where most people under 30 get their news, is there's a really intense [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=46.08s)]
*  doomerism and kind of negativity that just sort of comes with the meeting, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  More than anything. But I think it shapes people's views of politics. And when I tell people that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  emissions are setting all-time lows, solar deployment is setting all-time highs, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=61.92s)]
*  people don't know that we've actually kind of had a pretty good few years on climate stuff. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=66.56s)]
*  Yeah, it almost feels like when you remind folks of that they think you're being the buzzkill for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  the buzzkills, but it is important for us to communicate that we are winning. And this isn't [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=78.48s)]
*  just about a political context. This isn't even about cheerleading the president, although his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  leadership and willingness to work and make climate a priority is important to note. But this is really [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  about a story of people's movements winning. This is about frontline activists winning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=102.08s)]
*  This is about young people, you know, like the Sunrise Movement, bird-dogging senators, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=108.88s)]
*  and making this issue front and center and completely politically unforgettable and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  politically urgent that we pass the largest U.S. federal climate investment in American [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=121.28s)]
*  history. And that has translated already to nearly a quarter million jobs that have already [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=128.48s)]
*  been created of nine million jobs that are estimated to be created in the next several years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=135.04s)]
*  I gotta ask you about just the Hill the last few days, because it really has been crazy and weird. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  And just what you make of the Mayorkas impeachment and the fact that they're, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  you know, it's the first attempt to impeach a cabinet secretary in 150 years and they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=153.6s)]
*  miscounted the votes and they're going to try again on Tuesday. What do you think about it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=157.2s)]
*  I mean, I let's just call a spade a spade here. Republicans are dealing with not their first choice [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=164.0s)]
*  speaker, not their second choice speaker, not their third choice speaker. They're dealing with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=172.16s)]
*  the speaker that they could get and that they could agree on. And that means an individual that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=177.12s)]
*  does not have experience in party leadership, that is a relative newcomer when it comes to the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=185.84s)]
*  tenure of member that you're used to seeing when they typically get the speaker's gavel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=193.12s)]
*  And that means that the experience and vote counting is not quite up to the standard that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=200.0s)]
*  we usually see in a speaker. You're also dealing with the fact that this is an impeachment without [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=205.68s)]
*  merit. Secretary Mayorkas has demonstrated no abs. There is absolutely no evidence for an [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=211.36s)]
*  impeachable offense. It is completely politicized. It imperils the Republicans' own swing district [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=219.44000000000003s)]
*  members to force a vote on something so clearly craven and without merit that I think you see what [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=225.68s)]
*  happened last night, all of that coming together. And the fact that they think that Democrats owe it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=234.4s)]
*  to Republicans to give them their counts, our attendance counts, is laughable. It really speaks [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=241.2s)]
*  to the fact that you're working with people who are not used to being in this chamber. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they were mad that Nollum told them that Al Green was going to become wheeling back in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=255.44s)]
*  scrubs from abdominal surgery. You should have given them a heads up on that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=260.0s)]
*  And if you didn't expect Al Green to be doing that, then you don't know who Reverend and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Representative Al Green is. He will do that. He will do it. As demonstrated yesterday. It's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=269.2s)]
*  a good point. I want to ask a question about something the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=274.24s)]
*  and you tweeted this because I've been maddened by the discussion of immigrants, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=281.52s)]
*  which basically I feel like the entire discussion is they're coming to take your stuff. There's like [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=284.48s)]
*  only seven slices of pizza in America and everyone that comes is going to take one of those slices [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=289.52s)]
*  and you're not going to have any. And the Congressional Budget Office basically said today, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  look, we're readjusting our projection of GDP growth up by seven trillion. And also, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=296.8s)]
*  we're reading the U.S. government money to reduce the deficit by a trillion because of immigration, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=305.44s)]
*  higher net immigration. And you tweeted that being like, guys, we're not talking at all about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=311.76s)]
*  the net positives immigrants bring to this country. Absolutely. It is actually completely [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  nonsensical that we do not talk about the enormous blessing, economic blessing that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=325.36s)]
*  immigrants and immigration represents to the United States of America. And a lot of folks [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=332.48s)]
*  sometimes think that this is just a certain kind of immigrant, right? Like college educated or [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  technical visas, all immigrants that we're seeing. This is the CBO estimate. Immigration writ large [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=343.92s)]
*  is yielding enormous economic benefits to the United States. And let's bring this out even [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=350.96s)]
*  finer. If you are a caregiver, if you are a baby boomer, if you are someone that cares for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=356.08s)]
*  someone who is aging, we currently do not have the economic or social structural capacity [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  to take care of our seniors. And we will increasingly not have that if we, quote, unquote, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  lock up our border and shut down immigration. In fact, the thing that has distinguished [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=377.68s)]
*  U.S. economic performance from other countries like Japan or other developed economies is the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  fact that our pro-immigration policies actually allow us to continue in our economic growth, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  whereas similar countries with anti or more kind of closed border policies experience economic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=397.44s)]
*  stagnation when they submit themselves to this xenophobic kind of border panic narrative that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=404.08s)]
*  Fox News, frankly, seeks to peddle and instill in so many people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=411.68s)]
*  – Quickly, in the last 20 seconds, I know you are a no on the supplemental for Israel, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  barring some sort of strings attached on that aid. You said that we're seeing Gaza slaughter on a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  speech yesterday on the floor. How many Democrats are in that position? Do you have, is there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=426.0s)]
*  a rough count of how many no's there are in the caucus? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=430.8s)]
*  – What I will say is that the grassroots activism around a bilateral ceasefire is working, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=434.32s)]
*  and there are far more members than perhaps may be publicly visible that have a lot of trepidation [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=440.8s)]
*  around voting for an aid package that contains, A, no humanitarian aid, and B, I think we are [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=448.32s)]
*  crossing the Rubicon here in just no holds barred, completely unconditional aid to the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=455.68s)]
*  Israeli government. We have leaky laws on the books that prevent USAID from funding gross human [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  rights violations, and we, I think, are seeing a level of depravity in Gaza that is becoming [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=468.08s)]
*  morally untenable to support. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGCKhHTgjJU&t=474.64s)]
