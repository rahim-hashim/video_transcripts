# ‘Withering rejection’: Trump loses presidential immunity fight—twice in one day
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got huge developments tonight in two of the trials of Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=0.0s)]
*  Just within the last half hour judge Tanya Chutkin [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=6.0s)]
*  It was overseeing the federal criminal case about January 6th and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=9.4s)]
*  Issued a withering rejection of the ex-presidents attempt to get his criminal case thrown out of court [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=15.92s)]
*  Trump and his lawyers had argued that he had total presidential immunity and so the case should be dismissed outright [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=22.64s)]
*  Chutkin rejected that argument saying in part quote [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=29.8s)]
*  Defendants for your services commander-in-chief did not bestow on him the divine right of Kings to evade the criminal accountability [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=33.24s)]
*  That governs his fellow citizens now this ruling in that criminal case comes today in the wake of a federal appeals court ruling [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  That Donald Trump can face legal accountability for inciting the insurrection on January 6th in a civil case [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  That case brought by Capitol police officers and lawmakers who sued Donald Trump back in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=55.0s)]
*  2021 as the Washington Post explains they brought the suit under a roughly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=60.56s)]
*  150 year old law designed to combat [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=65.84s)]
*  KKK violence after the Civil War they argued Trump violated that statute barring the use of force threats or intimidation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=68.48s)]
*  To prevent government officials from carrying out their duties by conspiring with members of far-right groups to keep lawmakers from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=76.4s)]
*  Confirming the results of the 2020 election [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=83.04s)]
*  Again similarly in that case Donald Trump and his lawyers claimed that as they had in the federal case to steal the election [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=85.68s)]
*  That he had absolute immunity as president that he could not be held civilly liable or accountable for his actions around the attempted coup [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=92.28s)]
*  Now all that is a clear embodiment of the dictatorial powers that Donald Trump wants to ascribe to the presidency at least when he occupies it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=101.0s)]
*  While he was still in office Trump repeatedly spoke about his absolute power to do whatever he likes I [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=109.12s)]
*  Have the right to do whatever I want as president, but I don't even talk about that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=115.6s)]
*  It gives me all of these rights [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=121.16s)]
*  At a level that nobody has ever seen before when somebody's the president of the United States [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=123.72s)]
*  The authority is total and that's the way it's got to be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=129.76s)]
*  Total [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  After he left the White House as the legal pressure increased Trump zeroed in on this defense declaring at the end of last year quote as [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  President I have total immunity just a few months ago his lawyers in the federal elections case made the argument plainly on national television [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=141.84s)]
*  Everything that President Trump did was while he was in office as a president [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=151.64s)]
*  He is now immune from prosecution for acts that he takes in connection with those [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=156.04s)]
*  Policy so you're gonna so according to Donald Trump and his lawyers a president United States can just do whatever he wants [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=161.84s)]
*  He can never be held accountable for any of it while he was of things. He did while in office even after he leaves office [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=167.24s)]
*  This is Trump's view of presidential power. It is the view he will embody if he is reelected next year [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=174.32s)]
*  It is the view that judge Tanya Chutkin knocked down today in the federal criminal case and the circuit court in Washington DC [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=179.24s)]
*  Also knocked down today in that civil case [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=187.0s)]
*  The chief judge in that case explained quote when the president acts outside the functions of his office [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  He does not continue to enjoy immunity from damages liability [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=194.8s)]
*  Just because he happens to be the president when he acts in an unofficial private capacity is subject to civil suits like any private citizen [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=198.24s)]
*  when a first-term president opts to seek a second term his campaign to win reelection is not an official presidential act and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=205.28s)]
*  Trump himself recognized that he engaged in his campaign to win reelection [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=212.4s)]
*  Including his post-election efforts to alter the declared results in his favor in his personal capacity as presidential candidate [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=215.88s)]
*  Not in his official capacity as sitting president now to be clear on that civil case, right the lawsuit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=222.56s)]
*  It's not the final ruling on the plaintiffs argument [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=228.88s)]
*  So we'll go allow the case to go forward [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Give them a chance to prove that Trump broke the law and that they were injured as a result [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=233.28s)]
*  But again in in just 24 hours, right both of these rulings [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=237.6s)]
*  Huge and hugely needed providing some perspective on what actual judges think of Trump's claims of absolute and total immunity [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=242.52s)]
*  You [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fnpbP6dj8&t=267.44s)]
