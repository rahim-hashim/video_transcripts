Video Description: "Every time I looked up today—particularly during the first part of the day—Donald Trump's eyes were closed. He could have been meditating. He could have been napping. That's not for me to say other than I think he appeared to be at rest,” says MSNBC Legal Correspondent Lisa Rubin.

# Napping? Trump appeared to be ‘at rest’ during trial, says MSNBC correspondent
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI)
*  So today we finally got that long-awaited ruling on whether or not Donald Trump violated the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=0.0s)]
*  gag order in his New York election interference case. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=4.8s)]
*  The prosecutors flagged 10 instances, 8 from social media, 2 from his campaign website, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=7.88s)]
*  that they said ran afoul of the judge's order. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=12.94s)]
*  Most of the posts attack Michael Cohen, citing a New York Post article calling him a serial [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=16.12s)]
*  perjurer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=20.16s)]
*  Others go after adult film star Jeremy Daniels and former prosecutor from the DA's office, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=21.56s)]
*  Mark Pomerantz. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Now this morning, the judge agreed with the prosecution on 9 of those 10 instances. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  Judge Marchand finding Donald Trump in contempt of court, ordering him to delete the posts [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=31.36s)]
*  by 2.15 this afternoon, which he did. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=35.96s)]
*  Trump has also been ordered to pay $1,000 per violation for a total of $9,000 due on [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=38.84s)]
*  Friday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=43.12s)]
*  And if he does it again, the judge warned that, and I quote him here, the court will [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=44.12s)]
*  not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=48.16s)]
*  and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=52.76s)]
*  I'm joined now by LaDoris Cordell, who serves as a judge on the California Superior Court, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=57.4s)]
*  still with me here at the table, Harry Littman and Lisa Rubin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=62.36s)]
*  And Harry, you were saying something that I cut you off before we went to break. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, do you remember what it was? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=68.56s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  No, okay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  But this was, you buried the lead just now because this is the first time Trump has served, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Because what preceded this was Marchand saying the money just is not effective. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=79.72s)]
*  And really, he has now raised the hammer and said, next time I'm coming down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=85.56s)]
*  Lisa, you made the point that the $1,000 fine, for instance, is statutorily prescribed by [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=91.96s)]
*  New York law. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=96.88s)]
*  Judge Cordell, you were with us here and you have made a point that a lot of people took [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=98.52s)]
*  a lot of notice of, and I've heard back from folks who talked about your point that you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=103.42s)]
*  made here on this air, that you can say, look, there is going to be jail time, and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=108.28s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you how much it is or where it is until after the trial, so that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=113.76s)]
*  you try to get this disincentive effect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=117.04s)]
*  What do you think of the ruling by Judge Marchand today? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=119.52s)]
*  The judge's ruling was totally within his discretion. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=123.72s)]
*  He found nine violations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  But there's a bit of a dilemma he's created, and it's that he has another contempt hearing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=129.18s)]
*  coming up on Thursday. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=134.12s)]
*  And that's four more alleged violations. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=135.84s)]
*  So if the judge finds that all of those were, in fact, violations of his gag order, I think [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=138.6s)]
*  most people would think, well, then, you know, he's going to send him to jail. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=145.2s)]
*  Well, he really can't, because what he said today was that going forward, if there are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=148.04s)]
*  any more violations, these four preceded it, so now we'll have maybe 13 or 14 violations, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=154.0s)]
*  likely with more fines. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=160.72s)]
*  So had the judge had the two contempt here, the violations, put them all together and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=162.92s)]
*  had one hearing, I think we'd have a different situation here, where the judge probably would [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  be inclined to say, OK, that's enough. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=174.16s)]
*  You're going in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=176.28s)]
*  That's a great point, an important one, because subsequent violations don't count for this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=177.78s)]
*  hearing Thursday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=181.32s)]
*  I just want to just enter into the record here some of the posts by the defendant in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=182.32s)]
*  this case, which again, this is all very unusual. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=187.88s)]
*  This really doesn't happen. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  The judge has taken away my constitutional right to free speech. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=192.82s)]
*  I am the only presidential candidate in history to be all caps gagged. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=195.26s)]
*  This whole trial is rigged by taking away my freedom of speech. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  The highly conflicted judge is rigging the presidential of 2024 election interference. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=201.38s)]
*  He also said this is a total witch hunt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=205.98s)]
*  Hours of sitting down and listening to nothing except exoneration and lies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=208.14s)]
*  The trial is going like a speeding bullet because the judge is working hard to make [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=211.66s)]
*  all of his friends happy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=214.84s)]
*  He's rigged, crooked, conflicted, disgraced for our country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  This is today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=219.34s)]
*  This is today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  This is today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  One of the things he says here, and we've sort of made this joke before that it's going [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  too fast and too slow. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=225.62s)]
*  He's sitting there so much, but it's going so fast. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=227.22s)]
*  Two things to bring up here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=230.88s)]
*  One is the thing we discussed in the last block, which is the refusal to stipulate, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  is elongating the trial time, correct? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=236.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  It's hard to see how it couldn't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  The fact that you have to bring in the guy who's the head of C-SPAN archives from Indiana [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  with his counsel to go through the process by which C-SPAN records and keeps video archives [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=244.94s)]
*  of campaign speeches and make the jury sit through that too. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=250.78s)]
*  Imagine how many more times we might have to go through similar things for other videos, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=254.38s)]
*  for example. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=259.06s)]
*  It can't help but elongate the trial. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=260.06s)]
*  And this is a guy who's blaming Alvin Bragg for keeping him off the campaign trail when [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=261.82s)]
*  his lawyers and he have made choices that are keeping him there for longer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=265.5s)]
*  Not only that, just to follow up, he doesn't appear to be enjoying himself, and I can't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=270.18s)]
*  imagine I would either. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=273.82s)]
*  I don't think this is a strange character flaw. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=274.82s)]
*  He does a lot of resting of his eyes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=278.08s)]
*  We can't say what's going on. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=279.88s)]
*  This is Long saying the rosary in his head. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  This is a reverie about campaign speeches where he's falling asleep, whatever it is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  His eyes are closed a lot in that room. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  His eyes are closed a lot. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  And to me, what I will say is he appears to be at rest for considerable periods of time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=294.28s)]
*  I spend a lot of time with my nose either on my phone or my computer at the courthouse [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=300.4s)]
*  trying to transcribe or capture moments for you and our other colleagues here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=304.4s)]
*  But every time I looked up today, particularly during the first part of the day, Donald Trump's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  eyes were closed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  He could have been meditating. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=317.32s)]
*  He could have been napping. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  That's not for me to say other than I think he appeared to be at rest. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=320.32s)]
*  I brought Benaifle. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=323.64s)]
*  R-E-M we're talking about. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=324.64s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=326.64s)]
*  He was under. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=327.64s)]
*  Judge, let me ask you this question. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=328.64s)]
*  The pacing of the trial so far, I want to get your sense of how you think it's going. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=331.92s)]
*  Obviously, there is the fact that defense won't stipulate to these sort of archival [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  to these records. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  They have to bring in experts. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=343.72s)]
*  But what do you think about the pacing so far? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=344.72s)]
*  So it's really the job of the judge to make sure the trial is moving along. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=348.44s)]
*  And I know when I was on the bench and I had many jury trials, I was always looking over [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  at the jurors. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=357.12s)]
*  They were always looking at me too. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=358.12s)]
*  But to see if they were with us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=359.6s)]
*  Basically, I saw some people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=362.4s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm nodding out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=364.92s)]
*  Then we take a recess. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=366.36s)]
*  So I believe the pace is good. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=368.0s)]
*  These jurors are generally interested in what's going on in the courtroom. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=370.08s)]
*  And I think it's true basically of all juries and maybe a few exceptions. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=374.2s)]
*  They really want to do the work. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=379.0s)]
*  And they are paying attention to what's going on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=382.32s)]
*  And they know this is important. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=385.24s)]
*  And if I could just say one thing about the fines that President Machan imposed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=388.76s)]
*  I put out a call to New York legislators. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=393.8s)]
*  They need to amend the statute that punishes criminal contempt in New York. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=397.2s)]
*  It is ridiculous now to have the maximum fine of $1,000 per violation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=402.48s)]
*  It was probably right at the time because I don't think they ever envisioned having [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=408.24s)]
*  somebody really, really wealthy just blatantly ignore the orders of the court. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=413.04s)]
*  So I hope that happens sooner than later. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=417.8s)]
*  On the point of juries, this is a hobby horse of mine, but if you'll indulge me to briefly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=420.68s)]
*  write it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  It is the case that people's ability to pay attention for long periods of time, all sorts [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  of empirical evidence has pointed to that ability shrinking. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  And obviously we understand why that is. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=436.24s)]
*  We have constant stimulus and distraction. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=437.72s)]
*  And even just thinking about, I mean, this is happening every day across courtrooms across [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=440.12s)]
*  America. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  So this is just a slice of that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  But the idea of remaining attentive and fixed for this period of time, not looking at your [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  phone, not looking at other things, for everyone in that room, it has taken on a level of difficulty [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=451.52s)]
*  or strangeness in the normal course of things that I'm curious how you feel like when you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=458.24s)]
*  check in on the jury, how you think they're doing in that score. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=465.28s)]
*  I actually think they're doing really well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=468.44s)]
*  They all have, Chris, as you know, an individual monitor in front of them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=471.48s)]
*  And that certainly helps, particularly when an examination is document intensive because [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=475.6s)]
*  their eyes are fixed on, for example, the individual texts between Davidson and Howard [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=479.88s)]
*  or the emails between Davidson and Cohen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=487.64s)]
*  They certainly looked really attentively at the bank records that other people might be [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=489.84s)]
*  bored by. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=493.92s)]
*  They are really interested in the details, but the technology in the courtroom is assistive [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=494.92s)]
*  to them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  And that way in helping them stay engaged, they're closer to the players than anybody [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  else and they've got their own personal monitors with the exhibits demonstrated for them. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=504.0s)]
*  So it definitely is aiding the jurors' ability to pay attention. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=509.24s)]
*  That having been said, I think this particular jury is especially attentive, more attentive [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=514.52s)]
*  than, for example, the two juries in the E. Jean Carroll trials, which who I thought were [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=520.4s)]
*  also fairly attentive. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=524.8s)]
*  I would say it's them somewhat. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=526.92s)]
*  And there are a couple of people in particular, it's the best part of being in the courtroom [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=528.88s)]
*  to really focus. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=532.24s)]
*  There are a couple of jurors who you think, if he's got a shot at a hold on, maybe it's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=533.24s)]
*  they. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=537.88s)]
*  But they have come in and out. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=538.88s)]
*  And the text we were talking about where he's so aft, you could see their attention come [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=540.04s)]
*  forward. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=547.08s)]
*  But it's waned, I think, even in the days that I've been there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=548.08s)]
*  They're pretty good, but they're not at the edge of their chairs. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=551.44s)]
*  There's much fewer, much less note taken than there was. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=555.08s)]
*  Judge Ladores, Cordell, Harry Libman and Lisa Rubin, great to have you all. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=558.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m85zXPVpTAI&t=562.12s)]
