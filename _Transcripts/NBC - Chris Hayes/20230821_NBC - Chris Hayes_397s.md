Video Description: Jen Psaki on Republican 2024 candidates: “There is this cop out argument that you can either be talking about Trump, his legal issues and the past—or policy and the future. But there are few more fundamental policy positions for presidents than how you view democracy and national security of the country you want to lead.”

# Psaki: Why GOP candidates' ‘looking to the future’ line is a 'cop out'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE)
*  Good evening from Washington. I'm Jen Psaki and for Chris Hayes. In just two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=0.0s)]
*  days on Wednesday, Republican candidates will meet on a stage in Milwaukee for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=4.66s)]
*  the first Republican primary debate this cycle. It's also the week that the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Republican frontrunner, who announced he's skipping the debate, is required to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=13.56s)]
*  surrender to authorities in Fulton County, Georgia. If that combination of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=17.52s)]
*  things doesn't perfectly capture the state of the Republican Party right now, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=22.12s)]
*  I don't really know what does. And today, Donald Trump's lawyers met with Fulton [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=25.2s)]
*  County prosecutors to discuss his surrender over the 13 felony count [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=29.4s)]
*  indictment brought by district attorney Fonny Willis, where prosecutors say he [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=33.12s)]
*  orchestrated a criminal enterprise to steal the 2020 election in Georgia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  After roughly an hour discussing the terms, the attorney, the attorneys, along [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=42.8s)]
*  with Fonny Willis, came to an agreement over the ex-president's bond, and Atlanta [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=46.8s)]
*  judge set the bond for Trump at $200,000. The order also includes some striking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=50.68s)]
*  language, which stuck out to me, and a stark warning for the ex-president. It says, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=57.52s)]
*  quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Wonder why that was all needed in there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=75.36s)]
*  The agreement orders him to not make any threats against any witnesses or [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=77.52s)]
*  co-defendants, including threats made on social media. And the ex-president is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=81.16s)]
*  ordered not to discuss the case with his 18 co-defendants. One of those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=86.24s)]
*  defendants, Trump attorney and fake electors schemer Kenneth Chisbro, had his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=90.83999999999999s)]
*  bond package set at $100,000 today after his attorneys were spotted meeting with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=95.28s)]
*  prosecutors at the courthouse. Meanwhile, co-defendant and fake electors, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=100.52s)]
*  cum-emo author John Eastman, also had his bond set at $100,000. All of 19 [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=104.76s)]
*  defendants, Trump included, including him, of course, have until Friday to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=111.36s)]
*  surrender. And all of this is happening as the majority of Republican candidates [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=115.2s)]
*  seem to be on a whole nother planet, pretending like this isn't actually the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=120.76s)]
*  weirdest and the most unprecedented debate week in history. Just look at the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=125.28s)]
*  last few days. A few of the candidates seem to be having a hell of a time at [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=130.28s)]
*  the Iowa State Fair this weekend. Good for them. Former Arkansas Governor Asa [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=133.64s)]
*  Hutchinson seemed to enjoy cooking up some burgers, while former Texas [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=137.44s)]
*  Congressman Will Hurd took a selfie with a supporter. And every major Republican [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  candidate, except the one who has just been indicted, participated in a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=145.6s)]
*  forward-looking, policy-driven forum in Georgia. That all sounds refreshingly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  normal-ish, right? I mean, it's normal. Maybe we're back to normal. Except, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=154.88s)]
*  here's the problem, the big problem. Things are not normal. The most important [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  photo for history books this week, when we all look back, will not be of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=164.44s)]
*  Republican candidates cooking up burgers or standing on stage debating energy and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  tax policy on Wednesday. It will be the mugshot of the ex-President of the United [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=172.52s)]
*  States from when he surrenders, for the fourth time in just over four months, on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=177.84s)]
*  charges that he orchestrated a criminal conspiracy to steal the 2020 election in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=183.44s)]
*  Georgia. On Wednesday, the day of the debate, Trump plans to release a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=188.32s)]
*  pre-recorded video on social media with the TV guy formerly employed by Fox. And [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=193.0s)]
*  the next day, he may reportedly turn himself in. Here's the crazy thing, as if [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=198.48s)]
*  all of that isn't crazy enough. Despite the indictments thing, the jail thing, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  and even the mugshot thing, Donald Trump is still absolutely crushing everyone in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=208.28s)]
*  the Republican field by double digits. Coming up, we will talk to Steve [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=213.44s)]
*  Kornacki and Iowa pollster Ann Seltzer to discuss a striking new poll from NBC [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=217.76s)]
*  News and the Des Moines Register that shows Trump leading DeSantis by over 20 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=223.0s)]
*  points and some interesting data underneath there as well. And most [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=228.0s)]
*  candidates do not know exactly what to do with these numbers because they [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=232.12s)]
*  haven't moved that much in a while. So they keep talking about looking forward [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=234.76s)]
*  and not looking back instead of attacking Trump head on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=239.92s)]
*  I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=243.84s)]
*  happened four years ago in January. And so I want to focus on looking forward. I [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=249.48s)]
*  don't want to look back. We have to move forward. We've got to quit living in the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=254.88s)]
*  past. I look forward to having a conversation and frankly, even a debate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=258.16s)]
*  about the future of this nation. I think we need to move forward as a country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=261.64s)]
*  We've got to be looking to the future, not to the past. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=264.96s)]
*  But the problem is that all of this talk about looking forward, which, by the way, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=269.16s)]
*  is very normal campaign speak, only ignores the big political elephant in the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=273.28s)]
*  room, Donald Trump. Or maybe he's not in the room. If you talk about the debate on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Wednesday. It is based on this argument they all seem to be making that the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=281.52s)]
*  Trump indictments have nothing to do with the policy issues presidents deal [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=285.84s)]
*  with. That's just a distraction over here. There is this cop out argument that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  you can either be talking about Trump, his legal issues in the past or policy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  and the future. There are a few more fundamental policy positions for presidents [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  than how you view democracy and national security of the country you want to lead, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=303.92s)]
*  including their national security secrets. So let's start with the federal [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=308.48s)]
*  indictment around Trump's mishandling of classified documents and obstruction of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  justice. Holding on to classified documents, including nuclear plans, waving [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=315.8s)]
*  Iran war plans around with a disregard for the impact on national security and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  the people serving you around the world is a policy position. Then there's the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=326.24s)]
*  other federal indictment brought by special counsel Jack Smith for Trump's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=331.2s)]
*  attempted scheme to steal the 2020 election. Believing your victory, your [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  win is more important than the will of the public is a policy position as a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=340.0s)]
*  sidebar one that dictators take. Attempting to bend the justice system to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=345.32s)]
*  benefit you is a policy position. You don't see the role of an independent [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=349.76s)]
*  judiciary. That's a pretty important position to have. So have a conversation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=354.56s)]
*  about policy issues that we can all embrace that. But don't leave the core [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=358.68s)]
*  ones of the future of our democracy, the protection of our national security [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=362.24s)]
*  secrets out of the conversation because silence on those should be taken as [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=365.56s)]
*  complacent agreement with the policies of the current and overwhelming [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=370.48s)]
*  Republican primary front runner. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTcPSVYsUE&t=374.64s)]
