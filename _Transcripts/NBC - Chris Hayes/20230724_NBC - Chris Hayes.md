# Psaki to GOP candidates defending Trump What is your endgame?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q)
*  Just as there is no real precedent for Donald Trump's attempted coup in American history, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  there is also no real precedent for an ex-president facing multiple criminal indictments while [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=5.84s)]
*  he is seeking a second term in the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=12.32s)]
*  To me, it seems pretty obvious that the other 2024 Republican candidates might want to jump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=14.84s)]
*  on these charges. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=21.16s)]
*  You'd think that some of his opponents would want to try and maybe land a punch or two [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=22.8s)]
*  or five on the frontrunner. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=27.04s)]
*  Or maybe they would want to speak up simply because it's the right thing to do. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=33.64s)]
*  Since when has standing up for American democracy been a partisan thing anyway? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=34.96s)]
*  Never really has been before the last couple years. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=38.64s)]
*  But Trump's opponents clearly do not see it that way. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=41.48s)]
*  Here's what the guy who Trump's armed mob wanted to hang on January 6th had to say just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=45.64s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=50.68s)]
*  The president's words were reckless that day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=52.56s)]
*  I had no right to overturn the election. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=54.56s)]
*  But while his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=57.88s)]
*  were criminal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=63.32s)]
*  I really do hope it doesn't come to that and also for the reason that I do think the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=64.32s)]
*  Department of Justice has lost the confidence of the American people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=70.2s)]
*  Again, I mean, it's worth restating that this is the guy that Trump's mob wanted to hang. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=75.72s)]
*  And all he could muster was that it was reckless. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=82.0s)]
*  So OK, what about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the guy who most political strategists still [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=85.04s)]
*  say maybe, maybe there's a chance, a path of him taking out Trump? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=90.68s)]
*  What did he have to say? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=94.92s)]
*  I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=96.4s)]
*  four years ago in January. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  And so I want to focus on looking forward. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=103.24s)]
*  I don't want to look back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=105.55999999999999s)]
*  I do not want to see him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=106.56s)]
*  I hope he doesn't get charged. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it'll be good for the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=109.08s)]
*  I love how he vaguely references what happened four years ago in January as if it was like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=111.72s)]
*  a dinner date or something. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=116.52s)]
*  You know what's bad for the country, Governor DeSantis, when Republicans refuse to call [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  out the actions of someone who tried to overturn a Democratic election? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=121.84s)]
*  Maybe South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, the supposed middle of the road guy who's worked [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=126.16s)]
*  with Democrats before. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=130.32s)]
*  Maybe maybe he'll criticize Trump's attempted coup. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  I hold the folks who broke into the Capitol with ill will in their hearts, destroying [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=135.6s)]
*  property, responsible for their actions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=141.2s)]
*  I don't hold the former president who didn't show up at the Capitol and threatened my life [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  as responsible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=148.64s)]
*  So it seems that nearly all of the serious contenders to take on Trump have basically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=150.68s)]
*  made the political calculation that it's better to stand by him in the primary. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=156.28s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=161.0s)]
*  It is not working. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=162.52s)]
*  Mike Pence might not even make the debate stage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=164.16s)]
*  DeSantis is still running 30 points behind in Iowa, despite betting big, according to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=167.08s)]
*  his aides on the Hawkeye state. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=171.64s)]
*  And right now, Tim Scott is losing his own state of South Carolina by nearly 40 points. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=173.8s)]
*  To be fair, it's not exactly working to attack Trump so far either. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=181.88s)]
*  I mean, the never Trump candidates like Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson are polling in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=185.0s)]
*  the single digits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=189.6s)]
*  Well, behind most of these Trump apologists, it may be that the electorate is too locked [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=190.92s)]
*  into Trump at this point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  And we do have several months to go. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  But at least Hutchinson and Christie have clearly made the calculation that they won't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=200.04s)]
*  be remembered as enablers by the history books. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  That's worth something. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=207.4s)]
*  The rest of the field, though, is in a position where they are effectively enabling a guy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=208.66s)]
*  who led an attempted coup. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  And for what? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=215.04s)]
*  To maybe win a handful of delegates? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=216.16s)]
*  I'm like seriously asking you this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=217.72s)]
*  What are they trying to get out of this? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=220.44s)]
*  Does Nikki Haley want to be the vice president that badly? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=222.56s)]
*  Is Tim Scott hoping to be made secretary of commerce? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=225.28s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Ron DeSantis just started his second term as governor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Don't even get me started on Mike Pence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=232.4s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea what he wants out of this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=233.92s)]
*  So what is the overall end game here for all of these guys and Nikki Haley, of course? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=237.46s)]
*  Because right now they are all on track to be a footnote in the history books. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=242.68s)]
*  An asterisk in the also ran category. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=246.96s)]
*  Maybe an answer on Jeopardy on a good day. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=249.84s)]
*  Nobody remembers the guy who got 2% in Iowa and dropped out shortly after. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  But they will remember the folks who put politics over country and refused to stand up for our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  democracy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUg7cQJn0Q&t=260.68s)]
