Video Description: “Run. Run as fast as you can, my friend,” says Michael Cohen, giving advice to Trump aide and alleged co-conspirator Walt Nauta. “Donald Trump will throw you under the bus faster than you can possibly imagine. He won’t throw you under the bus to save himself. He’ll just throw you under the bus simply because he can.”

# Michael Cohen’s advice to Trump co-defendant Walt Nauta: Run.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk)
*  Donald Trump did not spend his post-indictment weekend strategizing with his lawyers, as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=0.0s)]
*  one might expect. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=5.44s)]
*  Now, the ex-president hit the campaign trail, glad handing with supporters at events in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=6.44s)]
*  Georgia and North Carolina. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=10.36s)]
*  And who is that over the president's shoulder while he signed memorabilia for his MAGA fans? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=12.4s)]
*  Why, it's Walt Noda, the former White House valet turned Trump staffer, who just so happens [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=16.44s)]
*  to be Trump's co-defendant in the documents case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=21.84s)]
*  The men will get to spend even more time together tomorrow when they are both expected to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=25.46s)]
*  arraigned in a Florida courthouse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=29.68s)]
*  That's when Noda will take the first step in a long journey that many others have taken [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=31.68s)]
*  before him on the path to becoming the latest fall guy for the boss. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=35.16s)]
*  Michael Cohen knows something about that journey, having gone to prison for taking part in that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  illegal hush money scheme Trump was indicted for earlier this year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=43.2s)]
*  Cohen is the host of the Mea culpa podcast and co-host of the political beatdown podcast. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=47.08s)]
*  The author of Revenge, how Donald Trump weaponized the U.S. Department of Justice against his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=51.28s)]
*  own critics. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=54.92s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=55.92s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=56.92s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=57.92s)]
*  I want to set something up here because I thought about testimony that you gave before [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=59.4s)]
*  Congress about how Trump communicates, where you talked about his his mode of doing this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=63.04s)]
*  And then I want to read from the indictment about the lawyer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=68.48s)]
*  We think it's Evan Corker, an attorney, one who made notes about how Trump talked to him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=71.3s)]
*  So this is you talking to Congress in 2019. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=75.06s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=78.08s)]
*  Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=79.08s)]
*  That's not how he operates. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't give you questions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=86.36s)]
*  He doesn't give you orders. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=88.12s)]
*  He speaks in a code. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=89.92s)]
*  And I understand the code because I've been around him for a decade. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Here's an example of the code. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=96.2s)]
*  This is Trump and Trump attorney one discuss what to do with the folder containing documents [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  with classification markings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=101.56s)]
*  During that conversation, Trump made a plucking motion as memorialized by Trump attorney one, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=103.56s)]
*  believe it's Evan Corker. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  And he made a funny motion as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  OK, why don't you take them with you to your hotel room if there's anything really bad [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=110.2s)]
*  in there, like, you know, pluck it out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  That was a motion he made. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=116.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=117.66s)]
*  Look, how many times more do I have to say that Donald speaks in code? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=118.66s)]
*  This one is a little bit less of a code. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=123.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=125.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=126.3s)]
*  The way that I had explained it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=127.3s)]
*  But this wouldn't be unusual. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've seen him do this when we were at the Trump Organization, when he questioned [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=130.38s)]
*  several of us attorneys in regard to turning over documents to the attorney general in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=136.46s)]
*  the Trump University case, when he said, why would you turn it over? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=141.9s)]
*  Just delete them, throw them away, get rid of them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=145.62s)]
*  So we're like, well, we're under subpoena. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=148.1s)]
*  And he was furious that one of the attorneys elected not to do it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=150.9s)]
*  And he was looking for somebody to validate the fact that he wanted it, that it could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=155.48s)]
*  and should be done. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=161.56s)]
*  You see, Donald has no respect for the law. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=162.56s)]
*  He has no respect for the Constitution. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=165.78s)]
*  He has no respect for process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=168.26s)]
*  He only cares about what he wants. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=170.12s)]
*  And as long as that is in concert with what he wants, it's acceptable. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=172.48s)]
*  Once it becomes adversary to what his wishes and wants are, he goes ballistic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=177.92s)]
*  I just want to go back to that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  So he's telling you, I mean, I guess it's a privileged conversation, but you know, like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  I said, the chip has sailed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  But he's telling you and the lawyers, like, why would you respond to, why would you truthfully [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=190.88s)]
*  respond to discovery, basically? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=194.12s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Which is what he apparently says here as recorded in this indictment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=197.56s)]
*  And that's why I said to you that none of this is unusual. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=202.0s)]
*  It's a repeat of something, as I said, I had seen and been involved with going back many, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=206.84s)]
*  many years now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=213.44s)]
*  There's also just his conception of a lawyer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=214.44s)]
*  He talks about the Hillary Clinton lawyer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=219.0s)]
*  He seems to think that lawyers have like a magical power, like it's like in a comic book [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  that like attorney-claiming privilege or something like makes them able to do stuff that like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=226.86s)]
*  other people can't do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=232.62s)]
*  And he wants them to do the bad stuff for him because they can do it and then save him [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=234.18s)]
*  getting in trouble. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm not so sure he sees it that way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  I see it more that he doesn't care who he throws under the bus. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=243.5s)]
*  As long as it's not him that's going to reap the repercussions, he doesn't particularly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=250.18s)]
*  care. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=255.94s)]
*  But he wants other people to do the stuff. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=256.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=258.62s)]
*  And if it's coming from a lawyer, therefore it's okay. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=259.62s)]
*  It's better for him because he always has the out that the lawyer should have known. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=263.12s)]
*  That's why I have him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=269.18s)]
*  He's my lawyer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=270.7s)]
*  He should have told me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=271.7s)]
*  It's plausible deniability. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=273.58s)]
*  Well that's what you get in this crazy scene where he goes behind the back of his own lawyer [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=275.42s)]
*  who's coming to search his stuff, moves all these boxes over the place. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=279.98s)]
*  The lawyer comes and does the search, finds 38 documents anyway, and then calls up another, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  a third lawyer to ask her if she would come to Mar-a-Lago the next morning to act as the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=288.42s)]
*  custodian records and sign a certification regarding the search for documents with classification [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=292.62s)]
*  markings. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=297.22s)]
*  Christina Bob, we think that's attorney three, had no role in the review of Trump's boxes [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  in the storage room. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=302.38s)]
*  So basically Corcoran gets wise to it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=303.38s)]
*  And then he's like, I can't sign this thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=306.62s)]
*  He gets Christina Bob to come and do it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=309.06s)]
*  And yet still 60% of the Republican Party says that they would vote for Donald even [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=311.06s)]
*  after an indictment. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=316.22s)]
*  Twice impeached, civilly held liable for sexual assault, indictment by state, indictment now [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=317.74s)]
*  by federal government, soon to be another state, Georgia, who knows what will happen [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  with January 6th. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=331.68s)]
*  And yet they'll still do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=333.22s)]
*  They'll still vote for a guy who legitimately does not want to be your president. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=334.9s)]
*  He wants to be your dictator. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=339.78s)]
*  But didn't you spend years looking up to this guy and thinking highly of him? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=340.78s)]
*  Remember something. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  Didn't you go through the exact same thing? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  I sure did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  And I warned people of exactly including Mark Meadows at my House Oversight Committee hearing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  when I said, I know what you're doing and it didn't work out right for me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=353.34s)]
*  And I assure you it won't work out right for you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=357.14s)]
*  The difference though is when I was representing him and taking care of him as his fixer, they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=359.46s)]
*  like to call me, he was just a myopic real estate New York, Florida developer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=364.74s)]
*  He wasn't the president of the United States of America. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=371.82s)]
*  So who really cared other than the handful of people that he was screwing over on contracts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  and so on, banks, et cetera? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=380.3s)]
*  What business was that of anybody else's? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=384.46000000000004s)]
*  Now as president of the United States, every single thing that he said becomes relevant [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=385.5s)]
*  to the world. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=390.68s)]
*  And the crazy thing is even though he's not president right now, he's still commanding [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=392.26s)]
*  more airtime than the current president, than the Biden administration. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=396.86s)]
*  Well, you know, if Joe Biden got himself indicted tomorrow, I could cover it quite a bit. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=400.74s)]
*  Well, you're probably right about that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=405.3s)]
*  I mean, and the bad part is what Trump is so clever at and he's so good at is this media [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=407.26s)]
*  manipulation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=414.08s)]
*  All of a sudden, who cares about him stepping up and walking up onto the tarmac for his [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=415.08s)]
*  plane or getting off? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  Why are we giving him so much oxygen to breathe? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=422.82000000000005s)]
*  I just say you let it go. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=425.86s)]
*  First of all, I don't think tomorrow is going to be as big a deal as everyone's making in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=427.54s)]
*  Florida. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=430.94000000000005s)]
*  It certainly wasn't a big deal here in New York at all. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=431.94000000000005s)]
*  There was more press than there were people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that the oath keepers or the, you know, the other crazy groups are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=436.82000000000005s)]
*  going to be out there, you know, doing anything protesting. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  Most of them are in prison right now anyway. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  And what happened to the help that Donald promised them? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=446.42s)]
*  Everyone that had done things to benefit Donald has gotten left in the dust. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=449.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=455.53999999999996s)]
*  And they will. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, that brings us to the final thing I want to ask you about is Walt Nata, who is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  indicted along with him and who is alleged to have participated in a conspiracy by being [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=462.58s)]
*  the person who moved the boxes at Donald Trump's direction and lied about it to federal agents. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  And that lie is recorded in the indictment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=470.86s)]
*  I find myself having some sympathy for the man, but I'm curious as someone who also has [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=473.78s)]
*  been in a somewhat similar position, how you feel about it reading the facts about Mr. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=478.04s)]
*  Nata. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=482.8s)]
*  OK, so Walt will get thrown under the bus. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=483.8s)]
*  There is no doubt about this one. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=487.4s)]
*  And if there's anything that I can do, I would look straight into the camera and say, Walt, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=489.6s)]
*  I know you're watching. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=493.16s)]
*  Run run as fast as you can, my friend. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=494.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=497.48s)]
*  And as a former military guy, I know you know how to run quickly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=498.48s)]
*  Run as quickly as you can, because Donald Trump will throw you under the bus faster [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=501.28s)]
*  than you could possibly imagine. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=505.86s)]
*  And he won't throw you into the bus simply just to save himself. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  He'll just throw you into the bus simply because he can and because he thinks it will provide [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=511.38s)]
*  him with some form of a benefit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=516.5s)]
*  I think that's I mean, I don't have a dog in the fight as it goes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=518.26s)]
*  I don't know Mr. Nata at all, but that seems like sound advice to me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  Michael Cohen, who does know a thing or two about how these dynamics work. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=524.22s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=527.42s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=528.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0jzloGBgk&t=529.42s)]
