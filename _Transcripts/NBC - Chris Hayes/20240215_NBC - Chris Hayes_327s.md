Video Description: The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the GDP of the U.S. economy is going to be boosted by $7 trillion over the next ten years due to the surge in immigration. “If you care about the growth of the U.S. economy and more deeply about the strength of our country as a whole—we should be grateful for our immigration rates and find ways to make paths into this great country more orderly and humane.”

# ‘Massive benefit’: Immigration surge set to boost U.S. economy by $7 trillion
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM)
*  The Congressional Budget Office, also known as the CBO, is a nonpartisan congressional agency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=0.0s)]
*  which has provided economic and budget data to Congress since the 1970s. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=6.16s)]
*  Earlier this month, it released its economic forecast for the next 10 years, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=10.88s)]
*  which included a really fascinating bit of information that I think has gone undercover regarding immigration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=14.56s)]
*  So the report effectively says that GDP, the growth of all of our economy, everything that we do, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=20.64s)]
*  is going to be boosted by $7 trillion more over the next 10 years due to immigration. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=26.16s)]
*  What's more, the federal government will raise an additional $1 trillion in revenue [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=33.04s)]
*  thanks to high immigration rates. That means that a trillion dollars will go into government coffers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  in the form of taxes paid that wouldn't have otherwise. Let me say that again. The U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  economy is going to grow by $7 trillion over the next decade solely because of immigrants coming [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=50.32s)]
*  here to the U.S. Put another way, the amount the economy is projected to grow each year over the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=57.12s)]
*  next five years alone is going to be higher than the previous 15 years in large part because of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=62.32s)]
*  immigration. In fact, the economy is expected to grow faster than it has since before the Great [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=67.6s)]
*  Recession. And as the CBO puts it, quote, that faster growth of potential GDP stems mainly from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=73.12s)]
*  the CBO's projection of a surge in net immigration, which increases the projected growth of the labor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=79.84s)]
*  force. Speaking of the growth of labor force, immigration is effectively saving our labor supply [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=85.68s)]
*  in this country. Look at this chart from the CBO report. So the orange line is the projected [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  growth of people working in this country. So see how it keeps going up at a dramatic rate? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Again, that is because of immigration, because even as our population ages out of the labor force, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=103.44s)]
*  more people retire, immigrants, most of whom are adults of working age, are coming in to fill the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=109.04s)]
*  gaps. All of which is to say it's not a zero sum game at all. It's not people coming to take your [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  piece of the pie for themselves. The pie itself is just getting bigger. We're making more stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=122.48s)]
*  There's more growth. To put it in raw numbers, the CBO projects the labor force in 2033, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=128.72s)]
*  the amount of people working in this country and contributing to the economy will be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=135.12s)]
*  larger by more than five million people, mainly because of immigration. Again, more people working [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=138.8s)]
*  and paying taxes and into social security. It also means more people buying houses, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  more people building houses, as CBO notes. Quote, because immigrants tend to live with family or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  friends initially and form their own households gradually, higher rates of immigration will [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=155.36s)]
*  continue to stimulate construction of new homes during the second half of the 2020s. Also worth [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=159.52s)]
*  noting, immigrants are more likely to start businesses than native born Americans, yet another [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=165.6s)]
*  boon to economic growth. But you don't have to take my word for it or even the nonpartisan [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=170.4s)]
*  congressional budget office. Just listen to Donald Trump's handpicked chairman of the Federal Reserve. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=175.44s)]
*  The U.S. economy has benefited from immigration and frankly just in the last year, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=182.24s)]
*  a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=187.92s)]
*  returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era. The country needed the workers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=193.76s)]
*  Right now, immigration, the border specifically, are arguably among the most dominant issues in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=201.12s)]
*  all of American politics. It's why Republicans in the House impeached Homeland Security Secretary [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=205.84s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas last night by one vote. Well, that was really more of a political stunt than [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  anything else. It was certainly the number one issue in yesterday's special election in New York's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=215.84s)]
*  third congressional district. While it's true, migration has produced genuine stress on a whole [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=220.72s)]
*  bunch of social systems and cities across the U.S., including here in New York. I gotta say, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=226.32s)]
*  the consistent tenor of the rhetoric surrounding immigrants in this country is maddening. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=231.2s)]
*  There's this notion that is embedded in the conversation about people coming across the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=238.8s)]
*  border in right-wing media, though by no means exclusively, which basically posits that life in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=243.44s)]
*  America is a zero-sum game, that there's only so much stuff and then when you add more people, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=249.76s)]
*  they come and take it. They're going to come take your stuff. And it's just wrong. In the most basic [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=255.12s)]
*  way, it completely fails to account for the obvious gift and bounty that is and has been [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  immigration to the United States. The countless social and cultural benefits, sure, but just the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  sheer dollars and cents massive benefit to our economy. And so as we get closer and closer to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  November's election, you're going to hear politicians, perhaps even politicians of both [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  parties, demonize migrants to score political points. But if you care about the growth of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=284.64s)]
*  U.S. economy and more deeply about the strength of our country as a whole, about the greatness of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=291.36s)]
*  America, we should be grateful for our immigration rates and find ways to make paths into this great [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=297.28s)]
*  country more orderly and humane. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgKBusMm5xM&t=304.16s)]
