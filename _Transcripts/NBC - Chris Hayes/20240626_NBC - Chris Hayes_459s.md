# ‘Pro-corruption’: Hayes goes off on Supreme Court ruling $13k gift is not a bribe
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Once again, the Supreme Court making news today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=0.0s)]
*  both for what they did do and what they did not do. The court did not rule on Donald Trump's wild, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=4.32s)]
*  desperate bid for total immunity for the crimes he committed while in office, a case that is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  very clearly the most pressing in terms of immediate deadlines, not to mention stakes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=16.16s)]
*  for American democracy. It's one in which this court's conservative majority has, at this point, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=20.8s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, obviously and intentionally dragged their feet to protect Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=26.0s)]
*  from going on trial before November's elections on charges of trying to overthrow American democracy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=30.4s)]
*  But everything you want to know about the Supreme Court can be learned from the decision they did [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=36.64s)]
*  release today and later from the decision they accidentally released today. You see, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=39.68s)]
*  for a brief moment today, the court posted a copy of a decision that appears set to allow [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  emergency room doctors in Idaho to perform abortions in certain situations. They quickly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=49.2s)]
*  took it down and we're going to have more on that later. But the first decision, the one they [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=54.48s)]
*  actually meant to actually put up and they read, the one they released on purpose, well, how can I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  put this? It effectively legalized blatant public corruption again. The case was called Snyder v [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=64.88s)]
*  United States and it involved this man, James Snyder, the former Republican mayor of Portage, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=71.84s)]
*  Indiana. Now, back in 2011, then candidate Snyder pitched himself to voters as a successful [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=77.28s)]
*  businessman, the owner of a mortgage company who could bring fiscal responsibility to the city of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=82.56s)]
*  Portage. You had my commitment that fiscal responsibility is so much more than a campaign [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=87.92s)]
*  slogan or a catchy phrase. As a business owner in the mortgage industry, we were on the front lines [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=94.0s)]
*  of the economic disaster. Each month, fiscal restraint was realized in different ways with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=100.48s)]
*  my employees and me because we manage and navigate it prudently. Our doors are part of the 5% [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=106.08s)]
*  of mortgage companies still open in Indiana. By 2013, Snyder was now the mayor. That pitch was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=113.44s)]
*  successful to the voters. It seems his theory of fiscal responsibility had not quite borne out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  As the Chicago Tribune reports, it was Christmas time 2013 and James Snyder was in trouble. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=125.68s)]
*  His mortgage business had tanked. The IRS was after him for a significant tax debt. And on top [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=130.48s)]
*  of that, he had holiday spending to account for. So Snyder showed up unannounced to Great Lakes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=135.68s)]
*  Peterbilt, the local truck dealership he'd helped to win two lucrative city contracts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  I need money. That's what I'm here for, the mayor told the owners. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=147.68s)]
*  Days later, the dealership cut Snyder a check for $13,000, saying it was for consulting that was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=151.84s)]
*  never fully performed. Okay, all right. So he steers contracts to this dealership. He shows up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=157.44s)]
*  He's desperate. He says, I need money. They give him $13,000. I'm not a lawyer, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=164.16s)]
*  but a sitting mayor marching into the office of a business where he had steered a million [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=168.16s)]
*  dollars in government contracts and saying, like, give me cash does not sound entirely on the up and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=171.92s)]
*  up. And you know what? The Department of Justice agreed. Snyder was indicted on federal corruption [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=176.64s)]
*  charges back in 2016. And after a lengthy back and forth and multiple trials, he was found guilty [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=182.64s)]
*  in 2021. His former mayor will spend 21 months behind bars. A federal judge handed down the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=188.24s)]
*  sentence yesterday. A jury convicted James Snyder of taking a $13,000 bribe from a trucking company [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=196.0s)]
*  and illegal tax evasion. Snyder has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He argues the $13,000 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=203.52s)]
*  was just a fee for his consulting work, though what that consulting work is a little unclear. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  What's more, it couldn't possibly be a bribe. And this is important. This is what he argued [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=214.32s)]
*  for the Supreme Court of the United States. It couldn't be a bribe, you see, because he received [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=218.16s)]
*  the money after the contracts were allocated. So if anything, it was more like a tip for a job. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Well done. Like he just, you know, like a barista, like he just moved the screen around and the guy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  was like, yeah, 13 K boom. Wouldn't you know it? The Supreme Court agreed today. They threw out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=235.2s)]
*  Snyder's conviction. Here's how Justice Brett Kavanaugh put it in his opinion. The question in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=242.96s)]
*  this case is whether the law also makes it a crime for state and local officials to accept [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=247.68s)]
*  gratuities, gratuities, for example, gift cards, lunches, plaques, books, framed photos, or the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  like that may be given as a token appreciation after the official act. The answer is no. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=259.12s)]
*  Framed plaques, books, you know, that thing. See, Snyder just accepted a gratuity, a little tip, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=265.44s)]
*  as a reward for steering a million dollars in contracts to a trucking company. It was like a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  nice book or a commemorative plaque or $13,000. And here's the thing. This is like sort of a narrow [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=278.8s)]
*  statutory interpretation decision about this aspect of the federal code. Was it proper to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=287.44s)]
*  prosecute him under this law? But the decision does not exist in a vacuum. You have to understand [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=291.76s)]
*  this. This comes against the context of the Supreme Court that has, first of all, increasingly lost [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=295.68s)]
*  the public's trust. And that's not just because Samuel Alito keeps flying insurrectionist flags [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=301.12s)]
*  outside his various homes or because Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny, was texting Trump's White [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=305.92s)]
*  House Chief of Staff conspiracy theories about the Bidens being sent to Guantanamo Bay, but because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=309.84s)]
*  of the allegations of rank, obvious corruption leveled against those two men. I mean, particularly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=314.96s)]
*  Clarence Thomas, the subject of our absolute favorite bar chart, which documents the $4 million [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=319.6s)]
*  dollars in disclosed and undisclosed, what would I call it? Oh, gratuities that he has received while [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=325.12s)]
*  on the court, like a luxury RV worth a quarter of a million dollars, trips on a private jet in a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=330.48s)]
*  super yacht. How do you think that guy feels about public corruption laws, whether getting gratuities [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=335.12s)]
*  is prosecutable? How about Justice Alito, who got a free fishing trip from Republican mega-donor Paul [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Singer and a hundred grand's worth of free travel on a private jet? What do you think his take is on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=346.88s)]
*  ethics rules for government officials? Would you be shocked to learn that both of those men voted [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=351.76s)]
*  to throw out James Snyder's conviction today? And this is not a one-off. This is really important. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=357.44s)]
*  This court has shown itself, both in practice and in theory, to be committed to a pro-corruption [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  agenda. In 2010, the Roberts Court limited the scope of federal corruption law in the case of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=369.92s)]
*  convicted Enron CEO, Jeff Skilling. In 2016, it overturned the conviction of former Virginia [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=375.2s)]
*  Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, who along with his wife, accepted nearly $200,000 in gifts, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=381.12s)]
*  gratuities you might call them, and loans from a local businessman, including vacations, clothes, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=386.96s)]
*  Rolex. In 2020, it threw out the convictions of former New Jersey government officials in the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=391.44s)]
*  corrupt Bridgegate scandal as they intentionally caused a massive traffic jam on the George [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=395.76s)]
*  Washington Bridge to punish a political rival. Now, to be clear and fair here, those decisions were [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=400.16s)]
*  not all right down all ideological lines. This one was, and it is clear the Trump Sixth Street [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=405.6s)]
*  conservative majority are the ones dictating a new, more radical direction of this court, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=410.8s)]
*  including today's decision. They really do seem to, in the aggregate, want to get rid of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=415.12s)]
*  criminalization of corruption and bribery. They want to make corruption legal and acceptable for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  all. And considering they went out of their way to bail out a former Republican mayor from the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=427.44s)]
*  small town in Indiana, what do you think we're willing to do for the former Republican president [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=431.92s)]
*  of the United States? Hey there, MSNBC fans, I'm Luke Russert, and be sure to join me, Rachel Maddow, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3AvSAJBUo&t=436.08000000000004s)]
