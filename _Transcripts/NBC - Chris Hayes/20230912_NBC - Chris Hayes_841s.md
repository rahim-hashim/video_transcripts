# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 11
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA)
*  Good evening from Washington. I'm Mehdi Hassan in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, the House is back in session following a lengthy summer recess. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=4.0s)]
*  And Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces a new round of headaches, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=8.0s)]
*  including a looming government shutdown and a renewed push from some of the most extreme members of his conference [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=12.0s)]
*  to impeach President Joe Biden for something. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=18.0s)]
*  They haven't quite figured that part out yet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=22.0s)]
*  If you want to understand just how ridiculous and cynical this impeachment attempt is, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=25.0s)]
*  let me introduce you to Republican Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=29.0s)]
*  If you've been following American politics for a long time, you might remember that name. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=32.0s)]
*  Buck first became notorious during a race for Senate back in 2010 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=36.0s)]
*  when he made these comments about his primary opponent, Republican Lieutenant Governor Jay Norton. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=41.0s)]
*  I don't know if anybody has any questions. I'd love to answer some questions, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=48.0s)]
*  but I'm not going to give my canned speech for the fourth time today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=51.0s)]
*  Good. Yes? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=54.0s)]
*  Why should we vote for you? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=56.0s)]
*  Why should you vote for me? Because I do not wear high heels. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=58.0s)]
*  In other words, vote for me because I'm not a woman. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=63.0s)]
*  Buck managed to lose that Senate race in a competitive seat, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=66.0s)]
*  even amid the 2010 Tea Party wave that provided massive gains for his party. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=69.0s)]
*  But he got himself elected to a House seat four years later, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=74.0s)]
*  where he made a name for himself as one of the most conservative members of his party. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=77.0s)]
*  Buck is a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=80.0s)]
*  He said he opposes abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=83.0s)]
*  He said of COVID safety mitigations, quote, we went like lambs to the slaughter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=86.0s)]
*  And he was one of a handful of votes against the first round of emergency COVID funding [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=90.0s)]
*  under Trump at the very start of the pandemic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=95.0s)]
*  So Buck is hardly a liberal, though he's not always in lockstep with the extremists in his own party either. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=97.0s)]
*  And here is what Ken Buck had to say about the push by some of his Republican colleagues, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=104.0s)]
*  including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to impeach President Biden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=109.0s)]
*  The time for impeachment is the time when there's evidence linking President Biden, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=114.0s)]
*  if there's evidence linking President Biden to a high crime or misdemeanor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=119.0s)]
*  That doesn't exist right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=124.0s)]
*  And it isn't really something that we can say, well, in February we're going to do this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=126.0s)]
*  It's based on the facts. You go where the facts take you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=131.0s)]
*  Even the no high heels guy thinks impeaching Biden is the wrong move. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=136.0s)]
*  And over on the Senate side, there is not much enthusiasm either. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=141.0s)]
*  Republican Senators Shelley Moor Capito, Mitt Romney, Jerry Moran, Mike Rounds, Mitch McConnell [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=144.0s)]
*  and even the extremely maga Tommy Tuberville have all thrown water on the idea of impeaching Biden before the 2024 election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=150.0s)]
*  Privately, they may even agree with their Democratic colleague, Senator John Fetterman, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=157.0s)]
*  who had a particularly, shall we say, colorful metaphor for the losing politics of impeachment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=161.0s)]
*  Go ahead, do it. Hey, Terry. You know, if you can find the votes, go ahead, you're going to lose. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=167.0s)]
*  It would just be like a big circle jerk on the fringe, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=177.0s)]
*  Sometimes you just got to go colder, call their bullsh**. They're going to throw it and then that's it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=182.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, Speaker McCarthy is still controlled by maga extremists in his party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=190.0s)]
*  And so it looks like he is pushing ahead with impeachment anyway. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=195.0s)]
*  His top adviser, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is demanding it, going so far as to split with her former maga ally, Lauren Boebert, over who wants to impeach Biden more. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=198.0s)]
*  Recently, Greene tried to downplay how extreme impeaching President Biden would be, saying, quote, It's just an inquiry. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=207.0s)]
*  It's like, may we ask the question? Let's take a little peek, just a little peeky peek. Peaky peek. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=214.0s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember how Marjorie Taylor Greene characterized the last impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=222.0s)]
*  As we go through watching this scam impeachment trial where you know what really is on trial, everyone, it's freedom of speech. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=229.0s)]
*  They don't want you to have your freedom of speech. They want to cancel you out because it's your speech that's the greatest threat to them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=237.0s)]
*  Just like my speech is the greatest threat to them. Just like President Trump's speech is the greatest threat to them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=245.0s)]
*  That is what is on trial this week in the Senate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=251.0s)]
*  But I guess now trying to impeach a president is just a peeky peek. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=255.0s)]
*  And I must ask, is this really how House Republicans want to use their narrow majority, especially considering a lot of analysts believe they could lose the chamber next year? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=259.0s)]
*  Didn't they pledge to do something about inflation, gas prices, the cost of living? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=268.0s)]
*  Instead, all we are getting is infighting about a doomed impeachment inquiry and pointless messaging bills that are dead on arrival in the Democratic-led Senate, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=273.0s)]
*  like a Parents Bill of Rights and a bill prohibiting the government from banning gas stoves. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=282.0s)]
*  No one's trying to ban gas stoves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=287.0s)]
*  It's governance by way of Fox opinion programming, and it has made this Congress one of the least productive ever. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=289.0s)]
*  As Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin said in a statement today, quote, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=295.0s)]
*  By August 2021, in the first six months of the 117th Congress, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=299.0s)]
*  House Democrats had helped kickstart our nation's economy with the American Rescue Plan and passed a budget with historic investments in working families. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=303.0s)]
*  We went on to pass legislation to reduce drug and energy costs, address the climate crisis, bring jobs back to America and rebuild our country's infrastructure [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=310.0s)]
*  with groundbreaking laws like the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips and Science Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=318.0s)]
*  By contrast, the first MAGA-directed Congress is by far the most reckless and least productive in decades. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=324.0s)]
*  Congressman Raskin is right. These MAGA Republicans don't actually care about accomplishing anything. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=330.0s)]
*  They're all just constantly auditioning for guest spots on Hannity or Ingram. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=336.0s)]
*  And their latest cynical, ridiculous, doomed impeachment push is just the latest proof of that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=341.0s)]
*  Indulge me for a moment in a thought experiment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=349.0s)]
*  What if Supreme Court Justice Katanji Brown Jackson's husband was discovered to have been working with a major Democratic donor [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=352.0s)]
*  on the funding of left-wing political activism for several years, say with, I don't know, right-wing villain and multi-billionaire George Soros? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=359.0s)]
*  What would Fox do? What would the Republican Party do? They'd lose their mind. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=367.0s)]
*  You would already have impeachment articles drawn up in the House against Justice Jackson, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=372.0s)]
*  even though George Soros, contrary to what Republicans would like you to think, has actually done nothing wrong. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=376.0s)]
*  Well, that is the subject of Politico's new reporting involving Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=380.0s)]
*  his wife Ginny, and the multi-millionaire conservative judicial activist and lobbyist Leonard Leo. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=386.0s)]
*  This comes on the back of the myriad Thomas scandals in recent memory, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=391.0s)]
*  like when he failed to recuse himself from 2020 election-related cases, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=395.0s)]
*  even though his wife Ginny Thomas has been accused of helping push the coup attempt in 2020. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=399.0s)]
*  Then there was the ProPublica reporting this year, revealing how Thomas failed to disclose [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=404.0s)]
*  multiple trips on billionaire benefactor Harlan Crowe's 162-foot yacht, flights on his private jet, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=407.0s)]
*  and weeks at his private resort, or the fact that Crowe paid for his mother's house, where she still lives rent-free, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=414.0s)]
*  or that he paid for his grandnephew's school tuition, who Thomas raised as his own son. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=420.0s)]
*  That reporting forced him to amend his financial disclosure last month. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=425.0s)]
*  And now a new Politico investigation is adding to that list, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=430.0s)]
*  reporting that Ginny Thomas' web of ties to Leonard Leo is far deeper and more financially entangled than previously known. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=433.0s)]
*  Heidi Prisibler is a national investigative correspondent at Politico, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=440.0s)]
*  and is the author of that new report titled What Ginny Thomas and Leonard Leo Wrought, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=447.0s)]
*  How a Justice Wife and a Key Activist Started a Movement, and she joins me now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=452.0s)]
*  Heidi, this is an incredible deep dive from you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=456.0s)]
*  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a statement on your piece today, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=460.0s)]
*  and said, we're living with the consequences of dark money's influence on the Supreme Court every day. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=464.0s)]
*  What was the most striking thing you uncovered in your reporting? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=469.0s)]
*  Well, there were a few striking things, Maddie. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=472.0s)]
*  Look, we've long known that Leonard Leo is the face of dark money behind the conservative Supreme Court movement. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=474.0s)]
*  But what we found was that the collaboration between him and the wife of a Supreme Court justice, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=480.0s)]
*  Thomas' wife Ginny, actually began just weeks before his decision in that Citizens United ruling, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=487.0s)]
*  which would, of course, benefit those very groups. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=493.0s)]
*  What we found also was that when that blew up, which was pretty quickly, Maddie, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=497.0s)]
*  when people found out that she is going to have her own dark money group, there was a lot of backlash to that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=501.0s)]
*  And this is the big reveal in the story, is that there was a Plan B, and that Plan B was activated almost immediately. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=505.0s)]
*  They pivoted to another dark money group and started paying her under the table. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=513.0s)]
*  Part of that was, we know, through Kellyanne Conway. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=518.0s)]
*  But the big question here, Maddie, based on all of the documentation that I had five IRS experts look at, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=522.0s)]
*  is did he ever stop paying her? What did he pay her for? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=528.0s)]
*  Did this go on for years? Because unlike the first plan, Plan A, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=534.0s)]
*  which was for them to have their own dark money group together, that blew apart, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=539.0s)]
*  We're not finding out about Plan B, which is this under the table arrangement where he was paying her via another dark money group [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=544.0s)]
*  and just having it billed with no mention of Ginny, of course, whether that ever ended. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=552.0s)]
*  And if you look at the arc of all of this, a lot of the people in Thomas' orbit, for instance, former law clerks, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=558.0s)]
*  were kind of brought into this. It is his former law clerk, Kerry Severino, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=565.0s)]
*  who for a time became one of the highest paid directors at this group, which is a non-profit group. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=570.0s)]
*  That's a whole separate can of potential worms there, Maddie, which I can get into in a minute. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=575.0s)]
*  But it stands that we don't know what kind of work she did for this charitable group. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=581.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be a charitable group. It's tax-exempt. And whether the payments ever stopped. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=586.0s)]
*  Piece two is about non-profit tax law. And I do not want to bore you all with this, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=591.0s)]
*  but it is something that's super important because it's the subject of a D.C. Attorney General investigation right now, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=596.0s)]
*  is the potential abuse of non-profit tax laws by Leo's network of dark money groups. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=606.0s)]
*  I'm sure all these non-profits were totally neutral in accordance with charity law. Of course they were. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=612.0s)]
*  Heidi, you report that a person familiar with Ginny Thomas's thinking around 2010, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=617.0s)]
*  before the Citizens United ruling, said, quote, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=621.0s)]
*  Ginny really wanted to build an organization and be a movement leader. Leonard, Leo, was going to be the conduit of that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=623.0s)]
*  Do we have an idea of how much money Leo has directed to Ginny Thomas or the timeline of when the payments began? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=630.0s)]
*  The timeline of when the payments began I might be able to be more helpful on. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=637.0s)]
*  The full amount of the money, I made several passes at them on and asked both representatives for Thomas as well as Leonard Leo's group [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=641.0s)]
*  and got no answers on that. But the timeline is extremely interesting and I encourage everybody to click inside the story [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=650.0s)]
*  because we worked hard to kind of distill that for you. However, it shows that to the month that the non-profit experiment [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=658.0s)]
*  between Leonard and Ginny blew up, by the way, because of a phone call that she made to Anita Hill, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=667.0s)]
*  which drew unwanted attention to her. But when that blew up, they pivoted immediately. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=674.0s)]
*  I mean, like within days, Ginny Thomas filed paperwork to create her own for-profit group. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=678.0s)]
*  And this group, the Judicial Education Project, which was used subsequently to pay her, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=684.0s)]
*  was retroactively reactivated to a little bit earlier in the year. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=690.0s)]
*  And the same amount of money, similar amount of money that she had made at her first stab at having her own non-profit with Leonard [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=695.0s)]
*  was then deposited into the Judicial Education Project, of course. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=703.0s)]
*  That is the problem, the actual essence of the problem with dark money is we have no idea what it was used for. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=708.0s)]
*  There were some IRS reporting discrepancies about how much it actually took in that were flagged to me. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=715.0s)]
*  I had to do a lot of work going through all of this tedious job of going through all of the IRS paperwork. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=721.0s)]
*  And thank God for the IRS experts, including the former commissioner, who really helped me distill it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=728.0s)]
*  We are glad you did it. Heidi, you reported recently that Leonard Leo's network of nonprofits, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=734.0s)]
*  profitable groups, is the subject of a Washington D.C. Attorney General investigation looking at whether Leo enriched himself and his friends. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=740.0s)]
*  Do you have an update on that investigation at all? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=747.0s)]
*  No update because that was not something I think that the D.C. Attorney General really wanted out there in the first place. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=749.0s)]
*  They prefer to keep these things quiet, but I did come upon that information, particularly because some of it included my prior reporting [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=757.0s)]
*  and was able to inform people that there is this investigation ongoing of Leonard Leo and his broader orbit of nonprofits [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=766.0s)]
*  because, Medhi, within the two years after Leonard Leo went to a for-profit from his full-time role at the Federalist Society, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=773.0s)]
*  $43 million went into his for-profit company. And again, we had trouble getting answers as to what kind of services were rendered for this money. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=783.0s)]
*  And then secondly, there were just a lot of examples there of individuals setting up side LLCs who were friends of Leonard, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=794.0s)]
*  including a very good friend who had taken in $7 million to his nonprofit even after its nonprofit status had been auto revoked by the IRS. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=801.0s)]
*  I wish the Senate Democrats were doing as much investigating as you are. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=811.0s)]
*  Heidi Prisbilla, thank you so much for your reporting. Really appreciate it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=817.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH-v3tUGzA&t=824.0s)]
