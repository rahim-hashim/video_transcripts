# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg)
*  Peter Navarro, the former Trump trade adviser on trial for contempt of Congress, is out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=0.0s)]
*  literally begging for money. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=5.76s)]
*  He says he is $1.4 million short of what his legal defense will cost. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=7.76s)]
*  He's not the only one. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=11.84s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani has been pleading with Trump to help pay his legal fees. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=13.44s)]
*  All he's gotten is Trump signing on to his fundraiser. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=16.28s)]
*  Jenna Ellis, another Trump lawyer who was indicted alongside him in the Georgia case, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=18.96s)]
*  has publicly complained that Trump is not paying the mounting legal bills for her or [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=22.44s)]
*  any of her other co-conspirators. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=27.56s)]
*  And one of the proud boys sentenced to 17 years for seditious conspiracy is hoping that Donald [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=30.68s)]
*  Trump will reelect and pardon them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=35.56s)]
*  Got to say, for any of you watching who either have been or are considering being a co-conspirator [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=38.68s)]
*  of Donald Trump, I don't think it's going to work out well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Perhaps the biggest expert on limitations of Trump's loyalty is his former lawyer, Michael [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=47.44s)]
*  Cohn, now host and co-host of two podcasts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  The author of Revenge, How Donald Trump Weaponized the Department of Justice Against His Critics, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=55.24s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, Michael, I thought of you as I was watching Peter Navarro. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm glad you thought of me, Chris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=62.68s)]
*  Well, you know, one was following around with a whistle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=65.88s)]
*  Be thankful for that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=68.08s)]
*  But just sort of in dire straits. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=69.08s)]
*  I mean, he's talking about left holding the bag. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=74.8s)]
*  Well, look, Peter should have understood early on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=75.8s)]
*  It's not as if we haven't been yelling this from the rooftops. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=81.68s)]
*  Donald doesn't care about anyone or anything other than himself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=85.48s)]
*  Look at how many different people have now ended up going away really at the direction [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=90.28s)]
*  of in concert with and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And he doesn't pay legal fees. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Peter should have seen this as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=102.84s)]
*  It took me four years in a lawsuit in order to bring Donald to the table in order to get [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=106.02s)]
*  legal fees that were due to other lawyers that I brought on in order to defend me and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=112.86s)]
*  my case, unlike Peter's and so many others, mine was done in 48 hours. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=119.42s)]
*  So you could imagine when he says he's one point four million shy, he has no clue what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=124.78s)]
*  he's talking about. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=130.22s)]
*  For an economist, he really doesn't know numbers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=131.44s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=133.74s)]
*  When he said that number, I thought, yeah, that's high. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=135.02s)]
*  But also I can imagine these things are high. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=136.66s)]
*  I mean, he had a one day trial today or two day trial. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=138.18s)]
*  But when you look at Jenna Ellis, the other folks in these Rico cases, I mean, my God, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=140.8s)]
*  I mean, that just seems like it's going to be an unbelievably costly enterprise. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=145.62s)]
*  And I guess my question to you is, wouldn't you think it seems to me there's two opposing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  forces, his cheapness and his self-interest, because you would think it would be in his [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  self-interest to just take care of everyone, to keep everyone inside the tent. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=161.02s)]
*  You know, there's a problem with that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't have the money for it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  And when he raises money from these unsuspecting magas, these morons that are just doling out [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=170.3s)]
*  money to him on a daily basis, he knows that he's going to need that money for the multitude [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  and the plethora of litigation that's coming at him over the course of the next year. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=183.86s)]
*  So he's not thinking about anyone else. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=188.94s)]
*  He has no interest in reaching into his own pocket if in fact that he actually has cash [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=191.78s)]
*  within which to pay all of these various lawyers, which I don't think he does. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=198.5s)]
*  I think as a result of everything that's been going on, Trump may be cash poor. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=203.14s)]
*  He may have assets, but he could be cash poor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=208.74s)]
*  And so he relies upon the donations that they're getting from these magas supporters in order [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=211.68s)]
*  for him to protect himself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=218.86s)]
*  That I believe is the problem. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=221.06s)]
*  So every dollar that he spends on a Rudy Coludi, every dollar he spends on a Pied in Navarro, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=222.52s)]
*  a Jenna Ellis or any of the other co-defendants in not just this case, but in all of the various [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=228.18s)]
*  cases is a dollar less that he'll have for himself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=234.62s)]
*  He's selfish. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  It's a strange situation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  I think, I don't know his finances, whether he is or is not cash poor, although you can [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  see that he's raising a ton of money for his lawyers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=245.46s)]
*  One other fascinating implication of that is, there's pretty good evidence there's a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=250.66s)]
*  sort of zero sum pot and money that would otherwise go to Republican candidates, particularly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=254.62s)]
*  Republican state. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=260.22s)]
*  Like that is all being, that money is not like an infinitely expandable pot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=261.22s)]
*  Like that money that would go to this congressional candidate in the swing seat, this center, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=266.14s)]
*  it's being eaten up by Donald Trump's legal fundraising. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=271.16s)]
*  Chris, let me be very clear about something, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=275.1s)]
*  Put this onto the scales of justice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=277.82s)]
*  It's Donald's legal fund, the RNC. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=280.66s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=284.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=285.14s)]
*  The answer is it will always end up in Donald's pocket. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=286.14s)]
*  Again, he's selfish that way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=288.82s)]
*  He will not allow a dollar to go anywhere else. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=290.94s)]
*  In fact, my understanding is money that they had raised and given to a super PAC that was [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=293.86s)]
*  for his benefit for the reelection campaign. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=300.14s)]
*  He's now asking for that money back so that he could use it for legal fees. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=303.62s)]
*  I mean, like I said, this is not somebody who is, it's not the actions of somebody who's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=308.46s)]
*  cash rich. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=314.14s)]
*  That's certainly for sure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=315.46s)]
*  I think I've asked you a version of this before, but I'll ask again because it feels newly [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=316.9s)]
*  relevant, particularly given that Peter Navarro tape and given watching these parade of folks [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=320.3s)]
*  who are convicted of such a traditional conspiracy doing, they're going to do 15 years, 16 years, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=324.54s)]
*  17 years, federal prison. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=328.26s)]
*  This is an enormous amount of time, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=329.26s)]
*  You know, you had some penny drop moment where you're like, this guy is not loyal to me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=331.94s)]
*  What is it that keeps people from seeing that before they have that moment? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=339.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question and I probably give you the same answer I gave you before. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=344.1s)]
*  It's stupidity. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=349.98s)]
*  I mean, for whatever reason, you know, you get entrenched into this dumpster cult of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=350.98s)]
*  Donald Trump and why Pina Navarro decided to, you know, show contempt to the court or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=356.14s)]
*  contempt to the congressional subpoena. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=364.5s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=368.9s)]
*  If you think about it, it's so stupid. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=369.9s)]
*  Show up, do what you're required to do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=372.58s)]
*  And plea the fifth is right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=377.46s)]
*  Instead, he failed to comply and now he's going to suffer the repercussions and he has [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=379.14s)]
*  no clue on the extent of the repercussions that he's now going to be confronted with. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  First of all, after the conviction, which I believe he will be convicted, not only do [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=390.58s)]
*  you lose your banking relationships, your credit card start contacting you now that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=395.74s)]
*  you're a felon. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=400.26s)]
*  They then drop you, your banks drop you, you can't get loans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=401.74s)]
*  You know, you lose your license for whatever it is that you did. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=405.86s)]
*  If he's a teacher or a professor, you're going to lose that gig. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=409.12s)]
*  You know, your family's happiness. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=412.84s)]
*  I mean, the extent of the damage that Donald Trump causes for those people who get caught [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=414.67999999999995s)]
*  up like myself in this cult of Trump, this dumpster cult, it's so far reaching that Pina [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  Navarro has not yet even contemplated the full extent of it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=429.79999999999995s)]
*  Dire warning, Michael Cohen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I'll go one step further for you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  You saw when he was grabbing at that sign of that woman. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=439.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm going to now warn him to keep his hands to himself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  There was a lawsuit, the Galizia case that Donald Trump, you know, had with his, with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=447.76s)]
*  Keith Schiller, his former bodyguard, where they grabbed the sign from somebody and they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=452.44s)]
*  ended up paying out a pretty substantial amount. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=457.12s)]
*  So Peter should learn to keep his hands to himself. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  I think the anarchy princess agrees with you standing behind him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  Michael Cohen, thank you very much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=467.16s)]
*  You have probably seen all you care to see of Vivek Ramaswamy lately. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=469.56s)]
*  That is because his campaign for the Republican nomination of president is entirely based [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=474.04s)]
*  on his getting as many media hits as possible, including appearing yesterday on the show [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=477.68s)]
*  of a YouTuber with a history of really gnarly anti-Semitic posts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=481.8s)]
*  The fast talking Ramaswamy, who Chris Christie famously said sounds like chat GPT, always [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=486.56s)]
*  appears unbothered by his stream of contradictions and falsehoods, never really gets nailed down [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=491.92s)]
*  long enough to be caught in that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=496.92s)]
*  But until today, Ramaswamy had not gone up against one interviewer in particular, one [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=499.28s)]
*  who is built for just this sort of situation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=504.14s)]
*  MSNBC's own Mehdi Hassan. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=507.29999999999995s)]
*  In retrospect, probably should have kept it that way. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=509.73999999999995s)]
*  So Mehdi, I've made this really easy for everybody. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=513.3s)]
*  And I did this in the early weeks of the campaign. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=517.02s)]
*  I released 20 years of tax returns. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=518.9s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=520.9s)]
*  Something that no presidential candidate, let alone somebody who's successful in business [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=521.9s)]
*  has done. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=524.74s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans alike, including the Biden family to do it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=526.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  We have 2009. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, you know what I would advise? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  Every 24 year old should take $50,000. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  2009 and 2010, you made $750,000. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  You had the money to pay for law school. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=540.48s)]
*  You didn't need a Soros Affirmative Action Scholarship that you now criticize. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=541.76s)]
*  None of this is worthy, but if you think it is, let's get to the detail. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=546.52s)]
*  That was actually the first big piece of money. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=549.8s)]
*  You say you're anti-affirmative action. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=551.28s)]
*  You took a scholarship for immigrants and their children. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=552.28s)]
*  So why'd you take a scholarship for the children of immigrants? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  Which falsehood would you like me to address? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  The financial one or the one about my views on affirmative action? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=560.8199999999999s)]
*  Because I can go in whichever order you'd like. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  Did you not make $750,000? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  On the financial piece of it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  Not at the time that I had applied for the scholarship that fall. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes you did. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  That December. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes you did. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  This is awkward for you because you did. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=573.8199999999999s)]
*  You can watch that full interview today on YouTube now and on the Mehdi Hassan Show at [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  7pm tomorrow on MSNBC on Peacock and Mehdi Hassan joins me. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=582.36s)]
*  You're I think the best interviewer in American media. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=587.36s)]
*  Oh you're too kind Chris. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=592.36s)]
*  At that kind of thing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=593.36s)]
*  You really are. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=594.36s)]
*  You're phenomenal at it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=595.36s)]
*  What is the Vivek Ramaswamy method? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=598.36s)]
*  What's been sort of amazing to me is like I feel like he's set some sort of Olympian [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=600.36s)]
*  record of glibness. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=605.2s)]
*  Just like everything is just like well I would simply do this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=606.7600000000001s)]
*  This is so easy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=609.22s)]
*  It's like everything is easy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=610.22s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=611.22s)]
*  It's like well no not everything is that obvious. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=612.22s)]
*  What was your takeaway from going toe to toe with him? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=615.22s)]
*  The takeaway I had is that there are two big issues with Ramaswamy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=620.22s)]
*  One is what is his qualification to be President of the United States. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=624.22s)]
*  Fair question. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=627.22s)]
*  And the other is can we trust anything he says. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=628.22s)]
*  And those were the two themes I stuck to. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=630.22s)]
*  He was a little irked by that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=632.22s)]
*  He did the kind of these are gotchas. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=633.22s)]
*  Why can't we talk about substance. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=635.22s)]
*  But my point is why would I want to discuss the details of your peace plan for Ukraine [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=637.22s)]
*  before we first establish whether you should be President. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=641.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=644.22s)]
*  Like anyone can say I've got a plan for Ukraine. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=645.22s)]
*  You go on the internet right now a hundred people have opinions on Ukraine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=647.22s)]
*  The issue is why this guy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=649.22s)]
*  What's he going to do about it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=651.22s)]
*  How can we trust him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=652.22s)]
*  And I think you know what I tried to do I asked him about you know he used to criticize Trump. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=653.22s)]
*  And now he doesn't because he probably wants to be Trump's Vice President. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=657.22s)]
*  So I put that to him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=660.22s)]
*  And you know the Soros stuff you just played. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=662.22s)]
*  This is a man who attacks George Soros. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=664.22s)]
*  He took a scholarship from the Soros family from Soros his brother and affirmative action scholarship which he claims to hate. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=665.22s)]
*  And then he said I didn't have the money for it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=670.22s)]
*  And I challenged him. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=672.22s)]
*  He said I never said that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=673.22s)]
*  It's another thing he does Chris. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=674.22s)]
*  He just denies things that are on tape. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=675.22s)]
*  I want to play that that exchange about that because he had tweeted after January 6 again. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=678.22s)]
*  I don't know if the tweet itself was pandering at the time or what he really thought. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=683.22s)]
*  I mean who knows where the line is right. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=687.22s)]
*  My suspicion is that he tweeted it because he thought it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=689.22s)]
*  But we'll see about what Trump did was was abhorrent and you had an exchange of that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=691.22s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=696.22s)]
*  Yes I want you to answer my question. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=698.22s)]
*  We've had three times I've asked it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=700.22s)]
*  What did Trump do that was downright abhorrent. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=701.22s)]
*  It's a simple question. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=704.22s)]
*  It's your words. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=705.22s)]
*  It's on screen. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=706.22s)]
*  I think what did he do that was downright abhorrent. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=707.22s)]
*  I believe that failing to unite this country falls short of what a true leader ought to do. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=711.22s)]
*  That is why I'm in this race is to do things differently. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=717.22s)]
*  Than any prior president has done them. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=720.22s)]
*  That's the hard truth. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=722.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=723.22s)]
*  And that's what made him a sore loser and abhorrent. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=724.22s)]
*  The media and the. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=726.22s)]
*  Ever since Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis brought a racketeering indictment against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=730.22s)]
*  We talked a lot about Georgia's particularly expansive version of that RICO law. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=735.22s)]
*  It creates real legal peril for the ex-president and his co-conspirators. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=740.22s)]
*  And it seems to be an appropriate tool to use against the transgression of their illegitimate and fundamentally unlawful project to overturn the election. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=745.22s)]
*  The very breadth of that law can be a real double edged sword as people in Georgia, particularly defense attorneys, will be among the first to tell you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=753.22s)]
*  We got an example of that yesterday when the very same grand jury that indicted Donald Trump also indicted 61 community activists and others, many of whom were attempting to stop the construction of a new police training facility. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=760.22s)]
*  Now, some of the people involved in that have been accused of specific crimes like throwing Molotov cocktails at police, for example, or approaching officers with weapons in a threatening manner. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=772.22s)]
*  But what this application of Georgia's RICO statute does is that it also rolls up a whole bunch of people who did things like get a sixty two dollar reimbursement for food and a twelve dollar reimbursement for glue as part of the conspiracy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=782.22s)]
*  These people are now looking at five years in prison, raising a whole lot of concern from legal experts and civil libertarians. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=798.22s)]
*  I mean, Sherrilyn Eiffel, former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote today, quote, These charges against stop cop city activists and bail fund organizers by the Georgia attorney general threaten democratic activism and effective organizing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=805.22s)]
*  Josie Duffy Rice, a lawyer and criminal justice reporter based in Atlanta. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=819.22s)]
*  She's been very closely following this case, and she's the host of the podcast unreformed, which is phenomenal, by the way. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=822.22s)]
*  And she joins me now, Josie. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=828.22s)]
*  First, I mean, the backstory here is there's been a long fight about this police training facility opponents called Cop City. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=831.22s)]
*  There's a battle right now to get a petition certified to have a citywide referendum, but sort of independent of the substance of that. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=839.22s)]
*  Right. There's been arrests of the folks, many of whom are anarchists, many of whom are avowed leftists and abolitionists who have occupied the forest and things like that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=846.22s)]
*  OK, fine. People get arrested for direct action. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=855.22s)]
*  What is different about this indictment? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=859.22s)]
*  Well, this indictment is a ridiculously broad use of the Rico statute to punish protesters for legal action. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=863.22s)]
*  And in some ways, not even for real action, like you said, for buying glue, for getting food reimbursement. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=873.22s)]
*  You know, there are there's a legal observer who is who was jailed while monitoring protests. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=880.22s)]
*  Right. Activists who ran a bail fund have been punished. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=886.22s)]
*  This is basically just a way to explicitly silence protesters, deter them from using their First Amendment constitutional protections and keep the protections. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=890.22s)]
*  Keep the fight against Cop City from really gaining more momentum as it has in Atlanta in the past few months. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=903.22s)]
*  So even on the technical part of the law here, I mean, it always seemed to me, you know, one of the complaints of folks like Mark Meadows like, oh, it's illegal to make phone calls now. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=911.22s)]
*  It's like, well, you know, these were there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=918.22s)]
*  There are acts that people can take that are legal in a Rico charge. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=920.22s)]
*  But everyone has to have committed at least one criminal act. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=924.22s)]
*  But in these cases, like the actual individual criminal acts didn't scan to me. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=926.22s)]
*  Like, I guess for some reason the bail fund is. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=930.22s)]
*  But it really seems like they are trying to get people to go to five years in prison for like contributing to a bail fund, which just seems. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=932.22s)]
*  Facially not OK. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=941.22s)]
*  That's right. I mean, like the truth is that the Rico statute in Georgia is broader than the federal Rico statute in the federal Rico statute was brought under Nixon. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=944.22s)]
*  It is pretty broad, Chris. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=952.22s)]
*  Like, it's not a joke. Right. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=954.22s)]
*  And here in Georgia, like you can be criminal overt acts that would not be criminal on their own can suddenly become criminal under the Georgia Rico statute. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=955.22s)]
*  You can be conspiring people that you don't even know you're conspiring with. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=966.22s)]
*  Right. And it's basically just a tool to to get people to plead guilty and testify against other people so that you get one or two hits. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=970.22s)]
*  You know, as a prosecutor, it's a reminder that you're not going to be able to do that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=981.22s)]
*  You know, when someone that we think is actually worth prosecuting is prosecuted under one of these statutes, they seem like a great tool of law enforcement. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=984.22s)]
*  But in actuality, they're they're used as weapons against people who have a lot less power than Donald Trump. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=995.22s)]
*  Well, one of the things that I think is quite distinct to the two is that the thing that was being pursued in the alleged conspiracy, Donald Trump was itself unlawful. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1001.22s)]
*  Like overturning election, return democracy. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1010.22s)]
*  Right. Like overturning election. It wasn't level. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1012.22s)]
*  There was no lawful means to do it right. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1014.22s)]
*  Saying that you want to stop a police training facility to have now there's many different tactics people can use for that lawful or unlawful. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1016.22s)]
*  Right. But that itself isn't unlawful. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1021.22s)]
*  That's that's politics. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1023.22s)]
*  People try to stop things from getting built all the time all across this great country of ours all the time. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1025.22s)]
*  I mean, to your point about the legal observer, Thomas Juergens, this is what the indictment says about him says on or about March 5th. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1029.22s)]
*  Thomas Juergens did join an organized mob and succeeded in overwhelming the police force, thereby aiding and abetting the offense of arson domestic terrorism attempt to occupy the DeKalb forest, prevent the building of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1036.22s)]
*  This is an overt act and furthers the conspiracy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1048.22s)]
*  We should note that he's a staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center and his own lawyer said he wore a bright green hat, a well-known identifier used by legal service. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1051.22s)]
*  He's saying he was there as a legal observer and they are charging him in this as part of the conspiracy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1060.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're playing fast and very loose with the truth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1065.22s)]
*  And this in this indictment, it is sloppy. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1070.22s)]
*  It is political propaganda. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1073.22s)]
*  It's not very it's not a very strong legal document. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1075.22s)]
*  They don't even get who owns the forest. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1078.22s)]
*  Correct. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1080.22s)]
*  Right. Which is a pretty key part. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1081.22s)]
*  If you're bringing charges against people for trespassing in the forest, it is it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1082.22s)]
*  This is partisan propaganda. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1087.22s)]
*  This is a way of sticking it to to people who are using the RICO statute against Donald Trump. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1089.22s)]
*  It is a way of punishing people who are going against law enforcement. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1096.22s)]
*  And it is a way of silencing protesters. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1100.22s)]
*  I mean, these are the people who say, you know, fight the government. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1103.22s)]
*  But this is what happens when you fight the government. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1106.22s)]
*  Yeah, we should know. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1110.22s)]
*  We can push back against them slightly. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1111.22s)]
*  When you talk about it, if people read the document, there's this long discourse on the nature of anarchism. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1112.22s)]
*  It talks about like mutual aid and social solidarity as being these sort of like nefarious code words for what they're up to. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1117.22s)]
*  This is the Times quoting a legal observer. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1123.22s)]
*  Some observers found it unusual. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1125.22s)]
*  Prosecutors give a detailed definition and criticism of anarchism as an ideology. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1126.22s)]
*  It seems like indictment of an ideological disposition as much as identified by a criminal acts and anti Michael Christ, who's a constitutional law expert at Georgia State University. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1131.22s)]
*  We should also note in terms of who brought this to Cab County, D.A. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1140.22s)]
*  Sherry Boston's been this program with true from criminal cases on this. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1143.22s)]
*  This seems to be the attorney general, Christopher Carr, Republican attorney general. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1146.22s)]
*  He's behind this prosecution. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1151.22s)]
*  He's behind it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1153.22s)]
*  And Sherry Boston actually said she wasn't going to go forward with this because it is so light. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1154.22s)]
*  It is so unsubstantiated. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1161.22s)]
*  And it is so clearly a way of telling Georgia, look, you bring charges against a man for trying to overturn democracy, the former president. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1163.22s)]
*  And we will bring charges against the powerless for exercising their basic constitutional right. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1172.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1177.22s)]
*  The echo is on purpose. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1178.22s)]
*  Josie, definitely. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1179.22s)]
*  That was great. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1180.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1181.22s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1182.22s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1183.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thch_3naqYg&t=1202.22s)]
