# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 24  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=0.0s)]
*  I can go up and I can say to everybody, oh thank you for the victory, it's wonderful, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  it's wonderful. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=7.96s)]
*  Or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=8.96s)]
*  An angry screed in victory. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=12.4s)]
*  The only person more angry than, let's say me, but I don't get too angry, I get even. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=15.4s)]
*  From a front runner self-identifying as a bad apple. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=21.2s)]
*  We caught the road cop, the bad apple, and perhaps you'll have that also with president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=25.2s)]
*  Tonight the case for more media coverage of Donald Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=31.6s)]
*  That. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  We're the last one standing next to Donald Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  The criminal justice case for Nikki Haley's enduring campaign. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=41.16s)]
*  Plus. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=45.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is a scab. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=46.44s)]
*  As labor united behind Joe Biden, why aren't we hearing what a second Trump term would [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  mean for you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=55.16s)]
*  Frankly, I think they should pull the abortion pill off the market and demand that the law [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=56.8s)]
*  is properly enforced. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  What All In starts right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=67.32s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=73.84s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=74.84s)]
*  We're through the Iowa caucus and as of last night, the New Hampshire primary. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=75.84s)]
*  And while Nikki Haley looks like she's going to hang around and cause trouble for Donald [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=79.32s)]
*  Trump for a bit, we'll see. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=82.72s)]
*  He has now won both of the early primary contest by double digits. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=84.52s)]
*  And barring any massive disruptions to the status quo, a health scare, a criminal conviction, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=88.68s)]
*  it just becomes more and more likely we are going to be living through another long campaign [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=93.76s)]
*  featuring the man that I and millions of other Americans consider to be an existential threat [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  to American democracy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=104.56s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  And while I get it, believe me, I really get it, that hearing about Trump nonstop for the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=107.68s)]
*  ninth solid year is painful, excruciating even, I do hold the slightly controversial [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=113.76s)]
*  position that Donald Trump is under covered in the main and the aggregate by the media [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  and that the media, all of us, should be talking about him more. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Hear me out here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  After the disgraceful end to his presidency, what happened was that we basically allowed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  him to live in the kind of shadows of the American consciousness. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=135.68s)]
*  Not that he disappeared, of course, but all the major networks stopped taking his speeches [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=139.68s)]
*  live again for very good reasons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  He was banned from basically every social media platform again for good reasons, siloing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=145.68s)]
*  himself away on Truth Social, where he essentially shouts into the MAGA void instead of into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  the loudest megaphone on the planet. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=155.76s)]
*  Now, again, at the time, many of us thought, I thought, this is a good thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=158.16s)]
*  I mean, for a bunch of reasons, people were sick of hearing his lies, which were becoming [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=163.68s)]
*  increasingly dangerous, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=167.68s)]
*  They had precipitated the violent sacking of the Capitol. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=169.2s)]
*  But what I would argue is that this arrangement that's been in place now for several years [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  has perversely ultimately come to benefit Trump and his sycophants and his defenders. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Because, after all, the more voters hear from him, the less they like him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=188.24s)]
*  It is absolutely true that voters are not paying as much attention to Donald Trump as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  they were four years ago. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  And when I say he has under covered, I mean that in a few ways. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  First, the substantive policy of what he wants to do and would do as president, what he did [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=202.4s)]
*  the first time, what he would do it again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=207.52s)]
*  There actually has been quite a bit of really good reporting on the real dangers he presents [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  in a second term. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  But as of now, I don't think it's quite broken through. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=214.56s)]
*  Back in 2016, I think most Americans knew the broad strokes of Trump's platform in certain [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=218.56s)]
*  ways, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  The stuff he wanted to emphasize. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=224.72s)]
*  Build the wall, make Mexico pay for it, enact a total ban on Muslims entering the US, and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  repeal and replace Obamacare. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=232.16s)]
*  Now, how many Americans, by contrast, know that Trump's 2024 platform includes a 10% tax, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  a 10% tax on all products imported into this country? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Everything. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=248.24s)]
*  Think of all the things that are imported, which would make everyday goods considerably [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=248.88s)]
*  more expensive. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=253.36s)]
*  Ending birthright citizenship for children born to immigrate parents in the US, millions [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=255.28s)]
*  and millions of Americans, un-Americanized. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=261.36s)]
*  Purging the federal government of tens of thousands of civil servants to replace them [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  with basically MAGA sycophants and lackeys. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's, I mean, again, that's just three small things. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  That doesn't even touch his inconsistent yet obviously extreme position on abortion [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=277.36s)]
*  rights. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=281.92s)]
*  So how many people know that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=283.04s)]
*  I would say not that many, honestly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  So that's one way in which Trump is undercover, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=286.88s)]
*  The substance of how dangerous his vision is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=289.6s)]
*  That 10% tax thing, the 10% tariff, like, I'm going to bet that's the first time you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=291.6s)]
*  heard it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=296.72s)]
*  And again, we're going to cover this, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=297.44s)]
*  The other way in which he is undercover, and this is going to be even more controversial, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=301.04s)]
*  but stay with me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=305.12s)]
*  Is the most trivial form of coverage that we all, and believe me, again, I, me, doing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=306.0s)]
*  this job, hate it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=312.0s)]
*  That's, for instance, the Trump tweet news cycle. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=314.32s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  Ex-president would tweet something aberrant, psychopathic, disgusting, racist, untrue, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  or cruel. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=323.2s)]
*  And then a lot of folks, sometimes us, not always, but would spend a day or two talking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=324.32s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  And it was just like incredibly annoying and exhausting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  But here's the thing about those news cycles. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=333.6s)]
*  They were very bad for Donald Trump politically. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=335.6s)]
*  They were bad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=339.76s)]
*  We know that not only because every other Republican in Washington would have to spend [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=340.72s)]
*  48 hours pretending like they'd never read the tweet they didn't want to talk about, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=346.16s)]
*  but also because we heard directly from Republican voters they wanted Trump to stop doing it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  One 2017 focus group found that Trump risked losing support from his voters in key swing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  states who felt he was prioritizing Twitter feuds over actual governance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=360.96s)]
*  Another focus group of Pennsylvania voters had a more succinct message, quote, quit tweeting. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=365.2s)]
*  One poll from the same period found that nearly 70% of voters and 53% of Republicans, a clear [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=369.76s)]
*  majority, thought Trump tweeted too much. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=375.44s)]
*  This was a consensus view. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=377.84s)]
*  Now, part of this was they didn't like the tweets because what the tweets revealed is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=379.84s)]
*  who Donald Trump really is. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=384.24s)]
*  Some people wanted to pretend it was just about the tweets, but they didn't like the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=386.88s)]
*  tweets. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=389.44s)]
*  It was just about the tweets, but it was Trump being Trump. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=389.76s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=392.08s)]
*  Trump got kicked off of Twitter after January 6th, though Elon Musk was invited back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=392.88s)]
*  And there's not been a Trump tweet news cycle since then. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=398.08s)]
*  And even though, if anything, he is even more unhinged and odious online now than he was [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  back then because he made himself his own little knockoff mag of Twitter where he kind [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  of gets the best of both worlds. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=410.56s)]
*  He can blow off steam showing off what an absolute, I mean, to the bone sociopath he [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=411.68s)]
*  is. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=418.48s)]
*  And no one outside of his most diehard supporters will ever see it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=419.52s)]
*  It's like perfect. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=422.96s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is really like, I really unhinged. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=424.96s)]
*  It's stuff that, you know, again, if you were seeing it all the time with a person in your [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  life, you would be worried about them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=431.84s)]
*  You wouldn't want them to be like hanging out with you or like being around your family [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=433.52s)]
*  or like in the workplace. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=438.0s)]
*  Like it would provoke deep distress if any person you knew was doing this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=439.36s)]
*  Just last night, spent hours on something of a true social bender, lashing out in all [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=445.44s)]
*  caps in post after post after post, again, like in this sort of maniacal fashion that's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=450.08s)]
*  deeply upsetting and unsettling, attacking everyone from Nikki Haley to his own former [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=454.88s)]
*  press secretary for their insufficient fealty to him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=459.12s)]
*  True, like unhinged, crank stuff. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=462.96s)]
*  And again, in a world where he was posting this on Twitter or Facebook, the entire world [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=466.88s)]
*  would be seeing it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=471.76s)]
*  It would have a tangible effect on his public standing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=472.8s)]
*  As long as it's relegated to its own private MAGA Neverland, most Americans are understandably [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=476.0s)]
*  more than happy to just ignore it entirely. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's not just social media either. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=486.32s)]
*  Unless they're actively seeking them out, most voters don't hear Trump speak at all [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=489.12s)]
*  anymore. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=494.24s)]
*  Unlike from 2015 through 2020, basically every network in the country airs remarks every [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=495.52s)]
*  single day, and every single day voters are reminded exactly how strange and petty and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=500.16s)]
*  dangerous the man was and is. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  And again, they did like what they heard. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  As a result, they voted him out of office resoundingly after one term by seven million [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=510.0s)]
*  votes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=516.72s)]
*  One term incumbent. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't happen that often in American politics. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  To be clear, I'm not necessarily advocating for airing Trump speeches live and unedited. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=521.28s)]
*  There's real, tangible social cost to doing that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=524.88s)]
*  As we noted on this network last night, when Trump literally began his New Hampshire victory [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  speech by lying about having won the Granite State twice in his general elections, when [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=533.2s)]
*  in reality he lost it both times. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=538.08s)]
*  As Rachel Maddow pointed out, Trump's refusal to engage with facts and truth and reality [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=541.36s)]
*  really is dangerous. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=546.0s)]
*  It's something we need to make sure voters remember. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=546.96s)]
*  Trump saying tonight, after having won the New Hampshire primary, which he has done twice [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=551.2s)]
*  before, having then gone on to say that's not enough, you can't just claim credit, you [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=556.16s)]
*  have to claim credit, you have to falsify the election results in the two times that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=561.04s)]
*  you lost the state, is a form of like reality bullying. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=566.24s)]
*  It's an exercise in bending reality to his will and insisting that others follow. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  It's an exercise in making people who love him denounce reality and endorse his view [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=575.52s)]
*  instead as a form of fealty, as a form of loyalty. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=582.32s)]
*  And it's a way of breaking the truth. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=586.32s)]
*  So yes, I get, I mean, again, this is what I do for a living. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=589.04s)]
*  This is my one precious life. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=594.0s)]
*  I've been doing this for nine years, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=595.76s)]
*  I get that paying attention to Donald Trump is painful. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=597.2s)]
*  For lack of a better word, it sucks, okay? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=602.24s)]
*  I've been doing it since 2015. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=605.2s)]
*  And believe me when I say that I want nothing more than to never have to talk about him [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=607.52s)]
*  again. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, it seems as though reminding Americans exactly who he is, like the guy [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=611.36s)]
*  in the flesh, not some memory of him, not some characterization, but him in the full [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=618.16s)]
*  realness of him and how much they actually dislike him may be crucial to saving American [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=625.6s)]
*  democracy from his current campaign to destroy it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=631.76s)]
*  An interesting data point. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=637.28s)]
*  Take a recent Marist poll out of New Hampshire, for example. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=638.24s)]
*  Voters there were finally forced to pay attention to Trump, right, in that state as he campaigned [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=640.72s)]
*  for the primary vote. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=644.88s)]
*  So people's attention was on him. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=645.6s)]
*  And for I think a lot of folks, it was probably the first time they'd really thought much [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=647.6s)]
*  about the ex-president for years. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  What was the result? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=652.8s)]
*  Even amid a wave of less than favorable headlines for President Joe Biden, right, in New Hampshire, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=654.88s)]
*  where there's a controversy over the primary, the poll found Biden beating Trump in New [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=659.84s)]
*  Hampshire by seven points. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=663.92s)]
*  That's the same margin he won by in 2020. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=665.68s)]
*  And my hypothesis here, and I think there's a lot of evidence for it, is that as soon [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=668.16s)]
*  as voters are forced to start thinking about Donald Trump again, they remember all the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  reasons they dislike him in the first place. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=677.12s)]
*  Sarah Longwell is a publisher of the Bulwark, host of the Focus Group podcast. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=680.4s)]
*  Jennifer Palmieri served as communications director for President Obama, as well as the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=684.16s)]
*  2016 Clinton campaign. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  She's now co-host of MSNBC's How to Win 2024 podcast, and they both join me now. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=689.76s)]
*  I'll start with you, Sarah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=695.04s)]
*  I'll start with you, Sarah. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=696.48s)]
*  Just, you know, I'm curious. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=697.44s)]
*  That's a piping hot take from yours truly. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=699.12s)]
*  And I'm curious what you what you make of it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=701.36s)]
*  Not only could I not agree with it more, but it is something that I've been saying for [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=705.76s)]
*  a while now when I talk about the way that swing voters seem to be sort of processing [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=715.5200000000001s)]
*  The first thing is, is that they are not yet, let me get grok'd, the fact that it is going [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=717.2s)]
*  to be a Trump-Biden rematch. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=722.32s)]
*  Like, that is just starting to occur to them. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=723.84s)]
*  The other thing is that right now, because Joe Biden is the president, voters know what [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=727.12s)]
*  they're annoyed about with Joe Biden. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=732.32s)]
*  If they're annoyed about the economy, they blame Joe Biden. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=734.48s)]
*  If they're annoyed about chaos abroad, you know, they're mad at Joe Biden. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=736.96s)]
*  They have forgotten what they hate about Donald Trump. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=740.4s)]
*  And I think that, look, I think this is the White House's strategy, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=744.08s)]
*  I think they want a contrast picture because they know when they get it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=748.0s)]
*  Voters, I mean, I have talked to swing voters now in focus groups for five years, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=753.52s)]
*  through multiple cycles. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump and candidates like him are repellent to sort of college-educated, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=760.16s)]
*  suburban swing voters, as well as, you know, even non-college working-class voters who [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=767.76s)]
*  just don't like the chaos. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, there is just a, there is a swing voting contingent that I personally, my theory, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  and my piping hot take, is going to grow from where we were in 2020 going into 2024, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=782.4s)]
*  in large part because when I listen to voters, there are plenty of people who voted for Trump twice [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=789.28s)]
*  and say never again. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=794.8s)]
*  Usually it's because of January 6th. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=796.56s)]
*  Sometimes it's because of abortion. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=798.48s)]
*  But there are plenty of people who've held their nose twice and they do not want this guy back. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=800.16s)]
*  And it is a visceral feeling of not wanting him back. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=804.48s)]
*  And part of the, I think part of the sort of bridge here to draw, Jen, is again, someone [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=808.4s)]
*  that's watching this right now, and God bless you and thank you, we love you, that, you know, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=814.96s)]
*  if you're watching us, like, you're pretty into politics, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=821.84s)]
*  You're pretty into news and you probably, probably aren't a swing voter. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=824.48s)]
*  There are some of you out there and again, we love you too. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  But the folks that are most likely to be swing voters, almost by definition, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=830.16s)]
*  are sort of just not spending as much time following political news. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=834.56s)]
*  And so this idea of like, well, we hear about Donald Trump all the time. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  It's like out there in the world of information that a voter who's fairly removed from politics [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=842.56s)]
*  might be processing, he doesn't loom quite as large. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=849.28s)]
*  He really doesn't exist. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=851.76s)]
*  And it is, you know, they haven't, they really haven't thought about him since January 6th, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=853.92s)]
*  right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=857.92s)]
*  That is my experience in talking with people. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=858.16s)]
*  They remember that. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=861.04s)]
*  They don't like that. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=861.68s)]
*  And then they went away and they don't remember a lot of the bad things about the presidency. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think, I mean, I have focused on New Hampshire for a while. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=867.04s)]
*  And, you know, as you raised the fact that even when Biden was losing across the board [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=871.12s)]
*  in battleground states, he was ahead in New Hampshire and he has been for a while. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=875.76s)]
*  And I think it's not just that they've been exposed to Trump, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=879.76s)]
*  but that those voters heard a lot of anti-Trump messaging, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=882.08s)]
*  particularly from Chris Christie. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=885.52s)]
*  Chris Sununu is constantly, even though Governor Sununu says he's going to support [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=887.12s)]
*  Trump in the end, he has been for years messaging against Trump. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=892.24s)]
*  And it's just been more prevalent in New Hampshire. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=896.8s)]
*  And I think you sort of hinted at this, Chris. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that part of the reason why the Biden team last night said Donald Trump is going [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  to be the nominee is this is a big hurdle for them right now in getting people on [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=907.28s)]
*  Biden's side. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=913.12s)]
*  And, you know, Sarah does focus groups every day. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=914.0s)]
*  I've seen them. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=916.32s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=917.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  They don't believe that Trump is going to be the nominee again. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=919.76s)]
*  And then and they're not excited about Biden and some demographics. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=922.24s)]
*  And then, you know, really, it's going to be Trump. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=925.84s)]
*  And then they're like, OK, I guess I guess I'm voting for Biden. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=929.12s)]
*  And they want people to start wrapping their heads around it as much as possible. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=933.2s)]
*  But, you know, until your opening about covering him more, when he was on Twitter, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=937.28s)]
*  he was not doing as well. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=941.76s)]
*  And, you know, he's the Republican de facto nominee. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=943.2s)]
*  What he says on Truth Social is what the de facto Republican nominee is saying, and it [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=947.04s)]
*  should be covered as news. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=951.28s)]
*  Yeah, let me just stay with you a second. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=952.64s)]
*  Then I'm going to come to you, Sarah, on this Twitter point, which I actually think is really [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  actually important. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=956.96s)]
*  But let me just say with you, Jen, on 2016, because this is a crucial part of this hypothesis [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=958.32s)]
*  is drawn from that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=962.88s)]
*  People forget this, but it was the focus away from Trump on Hillary Clinton, particularly [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=963.9200000000001s)]
*  the Comey letter and the emails in the stretch that was so crucial that there was [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=970.96s)]
*  an intentional shift in the coverage. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=976.4s)]
*  And people forget how crucial that was when the coverage was most on him. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=978.56s)]
*  He was doing more poorly. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=983.52s)]
*  That was that was the key problem. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=986.24s)]
*  I mean, he, you know, when the coverage was heard on emails around July of 2016. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=989.92s)]
*  And then he, you know, he buttoned up also to, you know, we saw that his Iowa caucus [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=994.48s)]
*  speech was buttoned up when he thanked people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1000.64s)]
*  That's how he was from Labor Day until October 7th. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1004.0s)]
*  He was making less news. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1008.8s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1010.0s)]
*  He was he was disciplined. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  I think he was listening to Kellyanne Conway and talked about what he should say. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1012.88s)]
*  He had he debated Hillary. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1016.64s)]
*  It even just the two of them on stage kind of elevated him. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1018.88s)]
*  He was doing he was doing better. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1023.04s)]
*  And, you know, access Hollywood happened that that was that was a kerfuffle. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1026.24s)]
*  But the Republicans for the first time in a dramatic way rallied behind him. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1029.44s)]
*  And then when the Comey letter came out, you know, 11 days before, then it was, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1033.04s)]
*  you know, it was back on her and he was not in he wasn't in the crosshairs. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1036.8s)]
*  And he also was a little more disciplined in the closing days. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1040.6399999999999s)]
*  I made a huge difference. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1043.68s)]
*  All the difference. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1045.12s)]
*  Yes, a huge all the difference. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1046.08s)]
*  And I think Sarah actually this relates to how aberrant he is as a person. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1047.2s)]
*  I mean, honestly, you can't keep it front of mind because it is so strange. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1051.92s)]
*  I mean, the truth social post from last night, it's like you like if you're not looking at them, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1057.84s)]
*  whatever you think in your head is actually going to be more sanitized [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1063.52s)]
*  than the reality because the reality is just so, so deranged. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1068.32s)]
*  Yeah, if we were going to make this up, nobody would believe us. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1074.72s)]
*  But let's just talk a second about who are the persuadable voters or who are the swing voters [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1078.08s)]
*  because you're dealing with two people who are essentially incumbents. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1085.6s)]
*  People kind of have they know these two people, so their minds are made up. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1085.92s)]
*  So you're dealing actually with with people that I would call sort of the double doubters [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1089.36s)]
*  or the double haters or even like the epochs on both their houses, you know, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1092.88s)]
*  people who don't like either of these guys. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  And so what happens is, is that, like I said, when they see Biden, they're like, yeah, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1099.2s)]
*  look, I'm sort of a center right independent or a moderate Republican voter. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1104.48s)]
*  I don't really I'm not a Democrat. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1109.92s)]
*  I don't like Joe Biden. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1111.2800000000002s)]
*  But when Donald Trump starts tweeting or bleeding on truth social or he's giving speeches and he's [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1112.5600000000002s)]
*  talking about the things he wants to do and he's going to ban Muslims and he's going to say this [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1118.72s)]
*  horrible sexist thing and he's going to call Nikki Haley, Burbring and everybody names, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1122.72s)]
*  that is when people start to say, you know what, actually, I hate that guy more. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  I hate that guy more. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1131.68s)]
*  Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri, Sarah Longwell, thank you for joining me. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1132.8s)]
*  Thank you for agreeing with my piping hot take, but you're under no obligation to do so in the future. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1136.64s)]
*  All right. Coming up, remembering Donald Trump's entire appeal to the donor class. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1142.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1149.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1149.68s)]
*  Happy to present a lot. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1150.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1152.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1153.28s)]
*  Get your taxes down. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1153.52s)]
*  By cozying up to the bosses helped cost Donald Trump a major endorsement. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1163.52s)]
*  That's next. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  We're all familiar with this certain Trump ritual at this point. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1174.3200000000002s)]
*  He humiliates anyone the Republican Party challenges him and then how [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1177.04s)]
*  they all eventually fall in line in the most self debasing way possible. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1180.8s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1184.56s)]
*  J.D. Vance, writer turned Ohio senator who long ago traded whatever dignity or integrity he had [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  for a spot close to Donald Trump. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1191.44s)]
*  Today, Vance posted an argument about why Republicans have to unite to beat Nikki Haley. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1193.52s)]
*  Take it from someone who was anti-Trump early on and then saw the belly of the beast. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1198.24s)]
*  The Republican Party without Donald Trump is disaster morally and politically. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1202.4s)]
*  It's endless wars, open borders and tax cuts for the people who benefit from endless wars [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1206.8s)]
*  and open borders. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1211.84s)]
*  Basically, it's Nikki Haley's platform, which is why we so desperately need to beat her. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1213.28s)]
*  Now, I kind of agree that the pre-Trump Republican Party was a disaster morally and politically, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1218.56s)]
*  but notice the endless wars and tax cuts. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1225.84s)]
*  You get that? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1228.88s)]
*  The reason you got to rally around Donald Trump and defeat Nikki Haley is because otherwise [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1229.92s)]
*  you're going to get endless wars and tax cuts for people that benefit. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1235.36s)]
*  I have some really bad news for J.D. Vance about what exactly Trump did while he was in office, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1240.24s)]
*  because he was actually the president before, so he actually had real power. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1245.84s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1252.24s)]
*  He expanded the drone wars and targeted killing. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1252.9599999999998s)]
*  He expanded strikes against Syria and even, crucially, Iranian targets, including a high [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1255.4399999999998s)]
*  ranking, the highest ranking Iranian national security official, which could have spun us into [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1260.96s)]
*  war. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1265.44s)]
*  He did not end any wars. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1266.0s)]
*  In fact, President Joe Biden ended the Afghanistan war, the, quote, endless war that had begun, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1267.68s)]
*  in the fall of 2001. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1273.28s)]
*  Now, domestically, the only two real legislative priorities Trump had was to try to repeal [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  Obamacare, which he failed to do, but is pledging to do again, working people be damned. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1280.48s)]
*  But he was successful in signing an enormous tax cut. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1286.24s)]
*  Yes, J.D., a tax cut for wealthy Americans and, crucially, corporations who loved it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1290.16s)]
*  He's also planning to do that again. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1295.44s)]
*  You see, this is a central part of the Trump con- Vance knows this, of course. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1298.16s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  It's the bait and switch, right? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1302.24s)]
*  It's the idea that Trump represents some repudiation of the pre-Trump Republican order, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1304.16s)]
*  when in fact, he was its implementer in office. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump was politically astute enough to realize back in 2016 that the establishment [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1313.2s)]
*  Republican default, the party's sort of Paul Ryanism, if you will, of basically government [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
*  by and for the plutocrats, was pretty unpopular rhetorically and ideologically with the party's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  base, and he shifted his rhetoric to court them. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1328.4799999999998s)]
*  But what will he do in office? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1332.08s)]
*  What will he actually do with tangible power? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  He championed all of the least popular Republican hardline policies, from appointing the court [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1337.4399999999998s)]
*  majority that repealed Roe to cutting the taxes of, quote, job creators. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1342.4799999999998s)]
*  And nowhere was Donald Trump's working class con more evident than in an episode last fall [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1347.52s)]
*  that was instructive. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1352.08s)]
*  Remember this one? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1353.2s)]
*  United Auto Workers went on strike against the big three automakers, and it was a bold [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1354.24s)]
*  strike, impacted factories that represented half of all cars made in the U.S. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1358.08s)]
*  And Joe Biden, who calls himself the most pro-union president, did something that, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1362.96s)]
*  as far as we know, no president has ever done before, made history. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1367.52s)]
*  He actually went and walked that picket line with the striking workers and delivered remarks [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1370.56s)]
*  supporting them. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1375.44s)]
*  Now that happened on September 26th of last year. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1376.4s)]
*  Then, on September 27th, we heard a whole lot about how Donald Trump was visiting an [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  auto factory to support the workers. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1384.8s)]
*  Except, in the Donald Trump version, he didn't go to the picket line. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1386.48s)]
*  No. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1390.24s)]
*  He went to a non-union shop at the invitation of the bosses to basically rail against President [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1390.88s)]
*  Biden and hope the media didn't understand the difference between the two. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1397.68s)]
*  You know who did notice the difference between the two? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1402.96s)]
*  The nearly half a million members of the United Auto Workers, who won their strike, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1405.92s)]
*  earned a really good contract, a historic contract, and understand that politics is [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1410.48s)]
*  about what people do with power and who materially supports your interests. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1415.92s)]
*  And today, the UAW announced their endorsement of Joe Biden for re-election. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1422.16s)]
*  It's not about your party. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1428.4s)]
*  It's not this bullsh-t about age. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1430.8s)]
*  It's not about anything but our best shot at taking back power for the working class. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1435.76s)]
*  If Donald Trump ever worked in an auto plant, he wouldn't be a UAW member. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1442.64s)]
*  He'd be a company man trying to squeeze the American worker. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  So if our endorsements must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1453.44s)]
*  Union rights are just one area in which the priorities and the actual governing agenda [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1459.28s)]
*  of Donald Trump are both really bad in the pocket of the richest interests in the country [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1463.28s)]
*  and really unpopular. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1467.44s)]
*  And one of the challenges of covering this election is that while so much attention Trump [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1468.96s)]
*  gets given to Trump, very little of that attention goes to the actual, just like basic bread and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1473.12s)]
*  butter policies a second Trump presidency would bring us. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1479.2s)]
*  So we're going to pay some attention to that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1482.72s)]
*  Next. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  Now go away. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1485.44s)]
*  You've heard the slogan that Donald Trump wants to make America great again. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1486.24s)]
*  But what that means is that he wants immunity from criminal prosecution. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1489.28s)]
*  He wants revenge against his political enemies. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1492.64s)]
*  And most of all, he wants adoring crowds of fans to keep on adoring him. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1495.2s)]
*  But what actual policies does he want to implement with a second term in the Oval Office? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1499.04s)]
*  What is on the Trump governing agenda? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1503.52s)]
*  It is not a rhetorical question. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1506.08s)]
*  It has a bunch of political issues. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1508.0s)]
*  It has a bunch of political issues. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1510.08s)]
*  It has a bunch of political issues. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1511.84s)]
*  It is not a rhetorical question. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  It has a bunch of possible answers. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1515.52s)]
*  Some of them spelled out. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1516.96s)]
*  None of them bode well for workers or for women or for immigrants or gay and trans people, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  among many others. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1522.96s)]
*  And all the possible items on a Trump agenda are frankly pretty unpopular among most Americans. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1524.72s)]
*  And I'm sure we're as a staff writer for The Atlantic. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1530.72s)]
*  Jess Valente is the author of the newsletter Abortion Every Day. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1532.88s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1535.92s)]
*  Jess, I want to start with you because this is on abortion politics is one place that [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  there's a few things going on where it's I think more out front. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1541.44s)]
*  The Biden folks understand how important and powerful this political issue is. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1545.2s)]
*  Hence, they did a rally talking about this yesterday. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1548.88s)]
*  Trump understands that it is politically deadly. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1552.48s)]
*  And so he really wants to obfuscate on this and pretend he's not going to do what he is [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1556.0800000000002s)]
*  going to do. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1561.52s)]
*  And so the question he used like tangibly, it's like, okay, well, Rose over Roe v. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1562.56s)]
*  Wade's overturned. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1566.24s)]
*  Like, how much worse could it be? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1566.88s)]
*  It could get so much worse. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1568.56s)]
*  I hate to say that. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  It feels so depressing already. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1573.2s)]
*  But the truth is a Trump presidency would increase the suffering that we're seeing [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  exponentially. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  In addition to a national ban, even if we didn't get a national ban, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1581.76s)]
*  he is going to do everything that the anti-abortion movement wants him to do. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1586.24s)]
*  And they are hell bent on making sure that abortion is banned in every single state. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1590.8s)]
*  And they'll do whatever they have to do. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1594.96s)]
*  They have a plan to take control of the FDA so that they can repeal approval of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1596.72s)]
*  metha pristone, which as we know is used in more than half of abortions in the country. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1602.08s)]
*  They have a plan to take over the DOJ so that they can use the Comstock Act so that you [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1607.92s)]
*  won't be able to ship abortion medication to any state. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1614.08s)]
*  You won't be able to ship abortion supplies, clinic supplies to any state. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1616.72s)]
*  It's an obscenity law from the 1800s. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1621.28s)]
*  They have a very, very specific plan waiting, just waiting for him to take the White House. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1623.36s)]
*  I think this FDA thing is so important. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1629.04s)]
*  I just want to stay with it for a second. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  And then Adam, I'm going to go to you because, again, this is one of those personnel policy [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1632.08s)]
*  issues, right? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1636.08s)]
*  Like the FDA, it's some federal agency, and someone gets appointed to run the FDA, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1636.6399999999999s)]
*  and they kind of do their thing. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1640.0s)]
*  But there's a real push. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1641.12s)]
*  And Mike Pence, in a good way, explicitly said this, basically, to use the FDA to just [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1642.08s)]
*  take it off the shelves. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  Here's what Mike Pence said, announcing what they view as the goal. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1649.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1653.2s)]
*  What is the first things a pro-life president should do if elected in 2024? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1655.68s)]
*  I think that our new president should direct the new attorney general to suspend [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1663.92s)]
*  all efforts to harass pro-life activists. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1668.4s)]
*  And then, frankly, I think they should pull the abortion pill off the market and demand [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1672.0800000000002s)]
*  that the law is properly enforced. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  So this is just like, again, this is a live issue. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1681.68s)]
*  They will try to do this if they get power. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1684.24s)]
*  I think, is yours, my sense is that people don't know this is on the agenda. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1687.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1693.44s)]
*  I don't think that they do. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1693.76s)]
*  And I think that Biden's team could do a better job of talking about it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1694.8s)]
*  Obviously, they're talking about a national ban. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1698.72s)]
*  They're talking about how dangerous Trump is. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1700.64s)]
*  But I think actually getting into the nitty gritty, even if it seems a little boring on [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1702.88s)]
*  the surface, could be really powerful and really important. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1707.36s)]
*  That clip that you just showed of Mike Pence, I'm pretty sure that the woman he was speaking [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1711.04s)]
*  to who was interviewing him is Kristen Hawkins, who's the president of Students for Life. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1714.56s)]
*  They want to ban birth control. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1718.9599999999998s)]
*  They are very explicit about this. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  They have this on their website. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1722.0s)]
*  Once they have control of the FDA, they can do all sorts of things. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1727.84s)]
*  They have, again, a very, very specific agenda in mind, and they know that they can count [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  on Trump to enact it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1732.4799999999998s)]
*  Adam, there's a bunch of stuff on there's there's stuff that Trump wants to be high [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1734.24s)]
*  salience, particularly immigration, which is the one place that Republicans want to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1739.04s)]
*  talk about policy, partly because I think they think they have a political advantage [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1742.24s)]
*  on it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1746.56s)]
*  But when you talk about, like, again, the basic stuff like what's your tax plan? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1747.28s)]
*  What's your health care plan? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1750.96s)]
*  I thought the Sean Fain endorsement was a good clear cut moment insofar as the degree [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1752.24s)]
*  to which all of the least popular parts of Paul Ryan nomics are still there in a second [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1759.36s)]
*  Donald Trump term. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1766.1599999999999s)]
*  The entire unpopular economic and social agenda, excuse me, the entire social and economic [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1769.36s)]
*  Republican agenda, traditional Republican agenda that has been unpopular, extremely [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1777.84s)]
*  unpopular is still there, and it's being covered up by the superficial populism that Trump [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1781.84s)]
*  is very good at that distracts people from what he actually wants to do. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1787.28s)]
*  And to Jessica's point is very clearly implied that he will try to run to the center on [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1791.6s)]
*  abortion, despite being the person who is most responsible for these abortion bans and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1797.2s)]
*  who is most responsible. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1801.36s)]
*  We can see what he would do as president in the States. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1802.16s)]
*  When you hear that women have to leave the state that they live in, in order to get care, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1805.52s)]
*  that is what they have in mind. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1812.48s)]
*  They have in mind a dystopia where women do not control their own bodies, where they are [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1813.76s)]
*  forced to carry their rapist babies to term, where they are forced to, where mothers are [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1817.92s)]
*  forced to carry pregnancies that are not viable to term because they would prefer that a woman [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1821.92s)]
*  die than get an abortion. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1828.0s)]
*  And that is what Donald Trump will implement as president. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1829.84s)]
*  And we know that because that's the agenda he pursued as president. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1832.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he actually says. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1836.24s)]
*  It's what he does that matters. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1838.64s)]
*  Quickly, a follow-up to that is personnel is also so crucial here, Adam. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1841.3600000000001s)]
*  When you think about Stephen Miller and what he did on immigration, when we think about what [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1844.88s)]
*  it would mean to have people that are devoted MAGA folks running the immigration bureaucracy [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1849.2s)]
*  of the United States of America, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1854.4s)]
*  Control, who have passed some MAGA loyalty tests, at every level of the government, they are [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1858.8000000000002s)]
*  signaling only the most fervent MAGA acolytes will be accepted in those positions. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1865.6s)]
*  What they envision is a presidency completely unbound by the rule of law. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1872.8s)]
*  And they think they can get away with that because they think they have captured the judiciary. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1877.76s)]
*  And at the very least, the Supreme Court sufficiently that it will not try to keep them in line the way [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1881.76s)]
*  it would a democratic presidency. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1887.04s)]
*  And so they think they can get away with doing basically anything. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1888.8s)]
*  Adam Serwer and Jessica Valenti. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1893.12s)]
*  Great to have you both tonight. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1894.96s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1896.0s)]
*  Still to come, he was one of Donald Trump's harshest critics until he wasn't. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1898.56s)]
*  Brand new reporting on what Senator Lindsey Graham told Georgia prosecutors [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1902.32s)]
*  about his golfing buddy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1906.24s)]
*  Next. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1907.52s)]
*  The original Trump critic turned Trumps sick of him. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1914.64s)]
*  Perhaps the most squirrely of them all is Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1917.2s)]
*  Back in 2015, Senator Graham was running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1921.52s)]
*  And he was about as critical as it gets. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1926.08s)]
*  I think he's a kook. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1930.32s)]
*  I think he's crazy. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1931.76s)]
*  I think he's unfit for office. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1934.8s)]
*  He's a jackass. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1938.32s)]
*  You know how you make America great again? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1939.68s)]
*  Tell Donald Trump to go to hell. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1942.16s)]
*  Then after he lost the primary and Donald Trump became president, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1944.56s)]
*  Graham did a complete 180. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1947.68s)]
*  He wanted so badly to be close to the man in power, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1948.96s)]
*  and he was willing to humiliate himself to get there. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  In October of Trump's first year in office, Senator Graham tweeted about a round of golf [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1954.4s)]
*  he played with the president. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1958.48s)]
*  How bad did he beat me? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1963.52s)]
*  I did better in the presidential race than today on the golf course! [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1964.88s)]
*  The slobbering continued up until January 6 when Senator Graham claimed [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1970.0s)]
*  he finally had enough. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1974.72s)]
*  Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1976.4s)]
*  I hate it being this way. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1980.24s)]
*  Oh my God, I hate it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1982.0s)]
*  From my point of view, he's been a consequential president. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1983.44s)]
*  But today, first thing you'll see. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1986.24s)]
*  All I can say is count me out. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1993.76s)]
*  I've tried to be helpful. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  By the way, consequential is funny. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1997.92s)]
*  Now, that didn't last long. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=1999.92s)]
*  Soon enough, Lindsey Graham was right back at it, tearing up on Fox News as he literally [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2001.2s)]
*  begged viewers to send Donald Trump money. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2006.8s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm so upset, but please help President Trump. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2012.16s)]
*  If you can afford five or ten bucks, if you can't afford a dollar, fine, just pray. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2015.76s)]
*  Make sure you vote as early as you can in your state. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2020.48s)]
*  Don't risk anything anymore. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2024.0s)]
*  Vote as soon as you can. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2025.6000000000001s)]
*  Pray for this country. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  Pray for this president. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2028.16s)]
*  And if you got any money to give, give it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2029.36s)]
*  Bro, bro, come on. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2032.9599999999998s)]
*  Now, nine years into this routine, Lindsey Graham has flip-flopped once again. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2037.04s)]
*  According to wild new reporting, Graham turned on a dime and quote, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2041.04s)]
*  threw Trump under the bus during his grand jury testimony in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2045.1999999999998s)]
*  Trump faces 13 charges in that state in connection with his efforts to steal the 2020 election. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2050.08s)]
*  Graham testified that if you told Trump that Martians came and stole the election, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2055.52s)]
*  he'd probably believe you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2059.6800000000003s)]
*  He also suggested to the grand jurors that Trump cheated at golf. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2061.04s)]
*  It got even weirder from there. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2065.04s)]
*  After Graham was finished testifying, he bumped into District Attorney Fonny Willis in a hallway [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2066.6400000000003s)]
*  and thanked her for the opportunity to tell his story. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2071.76s)]
*  That was so cathartic, he told Willis. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2074.6400000000003s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2076.8s)]
*  Then, to the astonishment of one source who witnessed the scene, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2078.56s)]
*  South Carolina's senior senator hugged the Fulton County DA? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2081.6s)]
*  According to one witness, Willis was like, whatever, dude. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2085.28s)]
*  All of those crazy revelations come from a new book by journalists Michael Isikoff [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2089.6s)]
*  and Daniel Klaidman titled, Find Me the Votes, a hard charging Georgia prosecutor, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2094.6400000000003s)]
*  a rogue president and the plot to steal an American election. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2098.8s)]
*  I'm happy to report that Michael Isikoff will join me for an interview about the book [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2101.84s)]
*  and all those incredible details in it on Tuesday night next week. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2105.6800000000003s)]
*  So Senator Graham, set your DVR. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2108.8s)]
*  Now you've all heard the chatter among the political class. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2115.04s)]
*  They're falling all over themselves saying this race is over. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2119.44s)]
*  Well, I have news for all of them. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2131.04s)]
*  New Hampshire is first in the nation. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2134.6400000000003s)]
*  It is not the last in the nation. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2137.84s)]
*  Nikki Haley took the stage and conquered New Hampshire last night. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2140.96s)]
*  She had one objective, to make it very clear, she is not dropping out of the presidential race. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2145.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's decisive win in the first of the nation primary [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2151.2s)]
*  does make Haley's chances of becoming the nominee nearly impossible, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2154.4s)]
*  at least under the current status quo. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2158.88s)]
*  So why stay in the race? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2162.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, a lot can change in the next few months. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2164.24s)]
*  Trump's facing 91 felony counts. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2167.12s)]
*  He's set to go on trial as soon as March. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2169.28s)]
*  As Brian Boettler explains in his great newsletter, Off Message, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2171.92s)]
*  if he is convicted or even if the trial proceedings damage Trump, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2175.6800000000003s)]
*  Haley wants to be running an active campaign to sweep up remaining delegates. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2179.28s)]
*  And Brian Boettler joins me now. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2183.44s)]
*  You know, Brian, you articulated the subtext here that obviously overhangs the whole thing [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2186.1600000000003s)]
*  because everyone looks at the numbers last night and it's like New Hampshire's probably [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2193.44s)]
*  the best state for her and she couldn't win there. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2196.64s)]
*  She lost by 10 or 11 points. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2199.68s)]
*  She lost Republicans by 50 points. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2201.3599999999997s)]
*  What's she going to do? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2203.8399999999997s)]
*  And yet she can't say, nor can anyone in Republican politics say the obvious truth [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2205.52s)]
*  about why it might make sense to stick with it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2211.12s)]
*  Yeah, and it's pretty perverse. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2214.08s)]
*  You know, I was thinking on my way down here, like how to explain how perverse this is. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2215.2s)]
*  And what I came up with is if you think back to like the 2000 election, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2219.52s)]
*  after the 2000 election, if Al Gore had thought to himself, you know, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2223.2799999999997s)]
*  they really did me dirty. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2226.72s)]
*  I should have won that race. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2228.08s)]
*  I got more votes than the other guy. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2229.04s)]
*  So I'm going to run again. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2230.96s)]
*  And I'm going to say that, you know, if I had been president, 9-11 wouldn't have happened. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2232.4s)]
*  And then he enters the primary and he beats John Kerry in Iowa and then in New Hampshire. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2236.48s)]
*  Like, I think John Kerry would have dropped out after New Hampshire. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2241.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2244.56s)]
*  But if it turned out that Al Gore had been committing like bank fraud or something like that, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2246.16s)]
*  you know, then I think John Kerry would have said, you know, we can't take a gamble on this guy [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2250.24s)]
*  or I should at least stick around because if he goes to prison, we're going to need a nominee. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2253.92s)]
*  And, you know, it just makes sense that that's what a party would want to have happen in a [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2258.32s)]
*  situation like this, where sort of because the party wants to nominate somebody else, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2262.8s)]
*  they're putting forth somebody who might end up in prison, but you can't say it in Republican politics. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2267.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, so that's, I mean, that, I think you're right about Haley. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2272.8s)]
*  I think you're right about why she's doing this. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2276.4s)]
*  There's two questions. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2278.32s)]
*  One is, can she withstand the pressure that will be brought to bear on her for long enough? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2279.2s)]
*  Right? Because if the point is that if you're going to stick it out on those grounds, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2284.72s)]
*  you got to stick it out till the convention. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2290.0s)]
*  I mean, that means like really sticking it out, going in, losing and losing and losing and losing [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2292.16s)]
*  again, because, you know, this trial, the first trial may not happen in March, might happen in [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2298.3199999999997s)]
*  April, maybe May or June. Like you, and that's a long way to go. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2303.12s)]
*  Right. Like I don't think she's going to stick it out unless she starts talking about it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2306.96s)]
*  Right. Like you mentioned Lindsey Graham and how he's gone back and forth on Trump. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2310.8s)]
*  And it turned out that behind the scenes, he's throwing Trump under the bus. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2314.72s)]
*  You know, he's from her home state and he's trying to edge her out of the primary [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2318.16s)]
*  so that the guy with all the felonies can be the nominee. And that, you know, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2322.96s)]
*  under a situation like this, where the whole leadership has coalesced around Donald Trump, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  the money is going to dry up. And if she's not out there saying, guys, we really need me or someone [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2329.92s)]
*  to be an heir in the event that this goes south, you know, the trial starts earliest in March. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2335.84s)]
*  She's going to have to start making the case. If not, I got to imagine that the pressure is going [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2342.0s)]
*  to overwhelm her and that she won't make it that far. Yeah. You write this, you said that the [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2346.1600000000003s)]
*  sickness of Republican politics makes it impossible for her to press this case, the GOP electorate. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2351.44s)]
*  After all, if it's a problem, Trump is a felon awaiting trial. It stands to reason he probably [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2356.48s)]
*  did something wrong, something he deserves to be held accountable for under law. Now, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2359.6000000000004s)]
*  DeSantis tried to make a version of it. The only time I saw anyone try to make a version, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2363.92s)]
*  which is that in that last debate with Haley, he basically said, you know, he's got these trials. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2368.56s)]
*  And again, he did it in this sort of gross and racist way. Like, what do you think is going to [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2374.08s)]
*  happen with a Democratic jury in the city of D.C.? You know who those people are, right? But it was [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2377.84s)]
*  the first time I've seen it said. But in the main, its absence as just a tangible problem to deal [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2384.08s)]
*  with. It's so striking, its total absence from all Republican Party and conservative conversation. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2392.8s)]
*  That's right. I mean, you did hear the only person who really brought it up in earnest [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2400.0800000000004s)]
*  and like trying to actually wake the rest of the Republican Party up to it was like Chris Christie. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  I guess Asa Hutchinson too. You know, Vivek Ramaswamy would say we got to nominate me because [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  the deep state is going to throw Trump in jail. Right. I have French legs. I'm a young version. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  And and Mike Pence would say, well, I think it's really rude of you to think that he'd be [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2421.2000000000003s)]
*  convicted if that maybe he didn't commit any crimes and he'll be acquitted. And so they have [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2425.04s)]
*  to do this weird dance instead of just saying the rule of law has to be vindicated. And if the rule [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2429.52s)]
*  of law says Trump is guilty of these crimes, we're going to need another nominee. And so we [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2434.7200000000003s)]
*  shouldn't just nominate him in January or February of twenty twenty four. Let me just play Nikki Haley [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2438.4s)]
*  is out again today and she's even sharper today on Trump, which is interesting. Take a take a listen. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2444.2400000000002s)]
*  That's. He pitched a fit. He was he was insulting. He was doing what he does, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2448.4s)]
*  but I know that's what he does when he's insecure. I know that's what he does when he [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2454.4s)]
*  is threatened and he should feel threatened without a doubt. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  We're going to see also if that like if she's going to stay focused on him sharply is going [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2463.6s)]
*  to be the other question, at least for the next few days. Yeah, it's not like she went easy on [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2468.96s)]
*  him last night or in that clip that you just played, but she's not really getting to the nub [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2474.64s)]
*  of why she that's right. Like, right. Why is she still in the race? And maybe she'll get there. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2478.24s)]
*  It'll be interesting. That will be very interesting. I would love for her to just say it like, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2482.7999999999997s)]
*  do we want a nominee who's indicted on multiple felonies slash will maybe be convicted? Oh, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2487.04s)]
*  I don't know. Like during the R.N.C. or a few weeks before it, at which point they're all going to be [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2493.2s)]
*  furious at the libs in the deep state for like, you know, sandbagging them. That's going to be [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2498.16s)]
*  my favorite plot twist in this prime boiler. Thank you very much. Thanks, Chris. That does it [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fTyOkBO1s&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
