# ‘Who voted for this?’: Trump admin obstructs cancer research funding
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. As of today, it looks as though Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=0.0s)]
*  is in the process of freezing federally funded cancer research in the United States. You [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=5.34s)]
*  got that? Cancer research. Why? Well, to be totally honest, we're not sure. But on his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=11.94s)]
*  orders, the National Institutes of Health has frozen everything. Cancer research, Alzheimer's, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=20.14s)]
*  diabetes. There's a lot not to like about the American health care system, but health [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=27.94s)]
*  research is one of the things that we do really, really well here in this country. We spend [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=32.86s)]
*  a lot of money on it for good reason. The NIH has a $48 billion budget, which funds [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=37.54s)]
*  50,000 grants to 300,000 researchers across 2,500 research institutions nationwide, all [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=42.74s)]
*  over the place, studying all kinds of things. Institutions filled with some of the brightest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=50.46s)]
*  minds from all over the world. Come here. I know some of them. Some of them are family [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=55.26s)]
*  members. Came to the US so that they could conduct gold standard research in medical [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  innovation to try to cure diseases that bedevil us. It's been woven into the fabric of this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=66.58s)]
*  country for decades. Among the buildings of the National Institute of Health to be dedicated [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=73.1s)]
*  here today stands the National Cancer Institute, created through provisions of the Act which [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=79.9s)]
*  I signed on August 5th, 1937. The work of this new institute is well underway. It is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=87.78s)]
*  promoting and stimulating cancer research throughout the nation. It is bringing to the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=96.78s)]
*  people of the nation a message of hope because many forms of the disease are not only curable, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=104.02s)]
*  but even preventable. Beyond this, it is doing research here and in many universities to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=111.02s)]
*  unravel the mysteries of cancer. The NIH is not particularly controversial. I think it's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=119.3s)]
*  a crown jewel of American governance and it's doing really important life altering work. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=126.38s)]
*  Again, it's not centralized. It's out throughout the country. Folks just spending every day in a lab [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=132.34s)]
*  trying to do things like find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's or a treatment for a rare illness. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, I don't think this has gotten nearly the attention it deserves. That research basically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=145.06s)]
*  just stopped. I don't mean this symbolically either. The actual convening of meetings and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=151.22s)]
*  grant boards to approve funding were just abruptly halted. In at least one case, mid-meeting, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=160.58s)]
*  apparently because of orders from the new Trump administration. Again, I'd like to tell you why [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  they're doing this, but honestly, no one really seems to know what's going on. NPR confirmed with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  one cancer researcher that a scheduled meeting next week was indeed canceled. As the academic [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  journal Science Reports yesterday alone, officials halted midstream a training workshop for junior [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=183.7s)]
*  scientists, called off a workshop on adolescent learning, because gosh, we don't want that, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=190.66s)]
*  right? Minutes before it was to begin and canceled meetings of two advisory councils. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=195.61999999999998s)]
*  Panels that were scheduled to review grant proposals also received 11th hour word they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  wouldn't be meeting. Staff also got word of an order directing the immediate and indefinite [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=205.06s)]
*  suspension of all travel for NIH employees. And as NBC News reports, nearly all scientific [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=210.66000000000003s)]
*  communication coming from federal health agencies, including the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=218.02s)]
*  and Prevention, have been stopped until further notice through multiple directors of the Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=223.46s)]
*  administration. Now, on that last point, communication freezes like that have happened before during the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  transition to a new administration, but again, to be honest, a lot remains unclear. And that muzzling [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=232.82000000000002s)]
*  could be really dangerous if we have like a huge outbreak of something. And right now, it really [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=238.26s)]
*  looks like health research funding, like the channel of health research funding in this country [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=244.26s)]
*  is shut down. One scientist told a reporter, I have never seen this level of confusion and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  concern in people that are extremely dedicated to their mission. While a senior NIH official said, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=257.38s)]
*  the impact of the collective executive orders and directives appears devastating for the institutes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=263.78s)]
*  We're not talking about like controversial stuff here. Okay. And I have to ask, who voted for this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=271.85999999999996s)]
*  Who voted to stop cancer research? The answer is nobody. Look, Donald Trump doesn't care about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=280.26s)]
*  public service or public health. He cares about himself. He wants to go after the people he feels [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=287.46s)]
*  wronged him. And again, I'm sort of trying to make the best case I can understand here that he thinks [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=292.66s)]
*  everyone in public health wronged him during the COVID pandemic and he thinks they are his enemies [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  in the deep state. He wants to shut them all down. I'm assuming this is just a pause. It's going to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=303.22s)]
*  get unpaused, but again, I don't know. And there's some pretty serious stakes here because as we've [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  learned the first time around, Donald Trump, who was by the way, president for four years, infectious [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  diseases do not care about politics and they don't care about Donald Trump's image management. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=318.98s)]
*  Remember when he openly boasted about artificially suppressing the tally of COVID cases? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=324.1s)]
*  Frankly, if we didn't test, you wouldn't have all the headlines because we're showing cases. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=331.3s)]
*  But if we did, think of this, if we didn't do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=335.06s)]
*  if we did half the testing, we'd have half the cases. If we did another, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=343.38s)]
*  you cut that in half, we'd have yet again, half of that. When you do testing to that extent, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=347.62s)]
*  you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=354.34s)]
*  slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We got tests that people don't know what's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=358.74s)]
*  going on. I mean, this is the deepest possible delusion, right? The case isn't related to the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  test. The case exists out there in nature. The test is whether you find out about it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=375.54s)]
*  And the actual numbers kept going up. Not testing doesn't mean fewer cases. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=380.1s)]
*  So to be clear, when we talk about how Trump is handling public health this time around, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  again, none of it's abstract or hypothetical, especially as we enter another precarious moment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  Right now, you might've seen this, medical experts are closely monitoring an outbreak [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=395.86s)]
*  of bird flu in this country. Thankfully, there is no evidence yet of human to human transmission, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=399.54s)]
*  which would be a huge and scary development. That said, the virus is mutating. It is tearing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=404.98s)]
*  through farms, even hitting bald eagles. A bald eagle found in the western suburbs has been [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=410.26s)]
*  euthanized after it was suspected of being infected with bird flu. Last Friday, the eagle was [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=416.74s)]
*  spotted with its head drooping in Hinsdale and eventually flew a short distance before handlers [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=421.94s)]
*  from Chicago bird collision monitors were able to capture it. Unfortunately, the eagle was [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=427.22s)]
*  euthanized one day later at the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center. I gotta say the American [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=431.86s)]
*  bald eagle, the living embodiment of the U.S. symbol, dazed and confused and dying of bird flu, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=437.7s)]
*  a little on the nose. And listen, I get it. After COVID, people are traumatized. People don't want [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  to think about what happened in COVID. They don't want to think about the aftermath. People don't [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=451.22s)]
*  want to talk about the possibility of another pandemic. Understood. But what do you think the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=453.62s)]
*  Trump administration is going to do if the bird flu outbreak really does become a problem? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=458.58s)]
*  You think the stop the test guy is going to want to release clear, direct, fact-based information [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=463.94s)]
*  to the public? Fundamentally, the lesson we had to learn the hard way the first time around under [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=467.94s)]
*  Trump is that manipulation of attention and messaging can win you elections, but it cannot [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=474.5s)]
*  overcome the implacable march of biology. Donald Trump never learned that lesson. And look, he won [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=479.62s)]
*  the election anyway because voters wanted lower egg prices. So it's a particularly ironic twist [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=485.94s)]
*  that one of the main consequences of this ongoing bird flu outbreak so far has been killing lots of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=492.18s)]
*  chickens and creating a massive egg shortage and skyrocketing egg prices. Maybe people will pay [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=498.02s)]
*  attention to that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3N0j9fw8k&t=505.14s)]
