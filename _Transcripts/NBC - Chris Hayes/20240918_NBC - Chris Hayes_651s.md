# ‘Sheer insanity’: Chris Hayes slams Trump for not understanding his own economic plan
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are so back this afternoon. Federal Chair Reserve Jerome Powell took the stage to announce the feds first cut in interest rates since 2020 and the beginning of the pandemic recession. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And it was a big one. A half a percent interest rate reduction to stimulate borrowing and boost the job market and acknowledgement that inflation has been tamed without a recession or high unemployment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=15.0s)]
*  In other words, the economy's landing has been soft and America has beaten back the nearly unprecedented economic challenges of the global pandemic and the ensuing disruption to the economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=27.0s)]
*  It's huge news. It's also proof the Biden economic recovery has been truly nothing short of miraculous, especially given the mess he inherited from Donald Trump and the fact the U.S. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=38.0s)]
*  has outperformed every other country on earth. Trump, like so many Republicans before him, has enjoyed a polling advantage with voters over Democrats on the economy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, that may be changing. Multiple national and swing state polls in recent weeks suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris is closing that gap and possibly even leading Trump on economic issues. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=59.0s)]
*  Now, Harris has probably been helped by Trump's inability to even feign caring about the expenses of regular Americans, like, for instance, child care. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=72.0s)]
*  As you proved earlier this month with that rambling answer to a direct question at the Economic Club of New York, it was mockable word salad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=80.0s)]
*  But with one really, really undernoticed but truly toxic ingredient that deserves much more attention. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=89.0s)]
*  If you win in November, can you commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care affordable? And if so, what specific piece of legislation will you advance? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=97.0s)]
*  Look, child care is child care. It's couldn't, you know, there's something you have to have it in this country. You have to have it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=109.0s)]
*  But when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers that I'm talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they're not used to, but they'll get used to it very quickly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=116.0s)]
*  And it's not going to stop them from doing business with us, but they'll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=126.0s)]
*  We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers will be taken in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=133.0s)]
*  Okay, so Trump very obviously has absolutely no idea what he's talking about, clearly has no plan for child care. Child care is child care. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=145.0s)]
*  But there is something in that answer that truly is a plan. And it's something he is both serious about and obsessed with. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Okay, listen to this. Donald Trump's central economic policy platform in this campaign is to raise taxes by trillions and trillions of dollars. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=163.0s)]
*  He just said it. Taxes that will be paid primarily by you, by working people in the form of a sales tax on imported goods. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=175.0s)]
*  That is his magic bullet, his obsession, an enormous trillion dollar sales tax on imported goods. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=186.0s)]
*  Except that's not what he calls it, right? He calls it a tariff. And Donald Trump loves tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=193.0s)]
*  It was a point he made repeatedly last night, including when he was asked again about bringing costs down for everyday Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=200.0s)]
*  How are you going to bring down the cost of food and groceries? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=209.0s)]
*  Our farmers are being decimated right now. They're being absolutely, absolutely decimated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=215.0s)]
*  And you know, one of the reasons is we allow a lot of farm product into our country. We're going to have to be a little bit like other countries. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=222.0s)]
*  We're not going to allow so much. We're going to let our farmers go to work. Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=230.0s)]
*  Now, I will say it's sort of disturbing. A guy who is already president, who has a degree from work and business school, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=236.0s)]
*  doesn't actually seem to understand the first thing about how tariffs work. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=242.0s)]
*  What he's trying to do is sell them as this free lunch that China and Mexico are going to pay for, the way Mexico is going to pay for the wall. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=246.0s)]
*  To him, it's the perfect Ponzi scheme. You just make the other country's exporters pay more to sell stuff in America problem solved. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=252.0s)]
*  That is not how it works. When a car gets imported from overseas and a tariff gets paid on it, that added cost gets passed on to you, the consumer. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=260.0s)]
*  The Honda sedan might have cost $25,000 before the tariff. Now it's going to cost $28,000. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=271.0s)]
*  You're going to pay it. And you can make an argument about why that might be good policy for other reasons, helping domestic car production. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=278.0s)]
*  What you cannot do absolutely is argue with a straight face that the tariff makes cars cheaper. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=285.0s)]
*  No, it does the opposite. You pay more for the car because you pay the tax. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=295.0s)]
*  Trump says tariffs will generate trillions of dollars, and maybe they will. That's trillions of dollars more. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=301.0s)]
*  You will pay for imported goods so producers can pay the government. A tariff is a tax on you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=308.0s)]
*  That's not just me saying that. That is the very conservative economists at the Pro Trump Heritage Foundation in a 2019 paper criticizing then President Trump's tariffs titled Do No Harm. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=316.0s)]
*  Tariffs and quotas hurt the homeland. Quote, many people believe that when tariffs are imposed on a country, that country bears the costs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=329.0s)]
*  However, that is not the case. When a government collects revenue from tariffs, it is collecting it from its own citizens, not from the citizens of the country upon whose goods tariffs were imposed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Thank you, heritage. Yes, as insane as it sounds, Trump has already imposed tariffs as president, and they raise costs for regular Americans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=350.0s)]
*  A point that was made earlier this year by David Stockman, a Republican ex-Congressman who ran the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald Reagan and was known as the father of Reaganomics. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=359.0s)]
*  He said that Trump's tariffs actually helped drive the inflation that hurt everyone over the past half decade. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=369.0s)]
*  He basically decided I'm going to levy a huge tariff on imports coming in from China. It averages, you know, about 20 percent on 360 billion worth of imports. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=377.0s)]
*  That's 75 billion or so a year of taxes on consumers. Now, to be clear, those tariffs don't just cost American consumers. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=392.0s)]
*  They can also hurt American producers. Remember, when Trump was president, he sold tariffs on crop foods as a way to help farmers, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=401.0s)]
*  We're going to protect the farmers with tariffs on imported grain. Instead, what happened? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=409.0s)]
*  Those tariffs sparked a trade war with China, which promptly stopped buying American agricultural exports, closing a massive market, ruining many U.S. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=414.0s)]
*  farmers and then forcing the Trump administration to keep them afloat with enormous subsidy payments. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=424.0s)]
*  As Haley Jackson reported for NBC News back in 2018. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=431.0s)]
*  Before Doug Bartek farmed this land in eastern Nebraska, his dad did and his dad before that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=436.0s)]
*  But these days, it's tougher to turn a profit. We need these tariffs to end sooner rather than later. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=442.0s)]
*  Those tariffs put in place by President Trump triggered a trade war. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=447.0s)]
*  The longer this goes on, it just makes it that much harder for us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=452.0s)]
*  You know, costs on our end seem to be going up all the time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=456.0s)]
*  Now it's farmers like Bartek, producers of soybeans, dairy, cotton and more getting an assist from the Trump administration as the president helps people his own policies hurt. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=459.0s)]
*  A new temporary 12 billion dollar program is set to launch around Labor Day, meant to offset the estimated 11 billion in losses farmers face. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=470.0s)]
*  Now, in fairness to Trump, those terrorists, like all taxes, do raise revenue. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=479.0s)]
*  His did raise billions of dollars, almost all of which 92 percent the Trump administration had to spend bailing out the farmers whose business was decimated by said tariffs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=484.0s)]
*  When all was said and done, those Trump subsidies to farmers amounted to more than the U.S. spends to maintain its arsenal of nuclear weapons, more than the entire budget of the State Department or NASA. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=496.0s)]
*  So now get this Trump's answer to cutting your household or childcare expenses is to do a lot more tariffs. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=507.0s)]
*  I mean, last night, a woman asked him, how are you going to lower my grocery prices? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=516.0s)]
*  And Trump's response in short is I'm going to raise taxes on groceries. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=521.0s)]
*  It is the very definition of crazy doing the same thing, expecting different results. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=527.0s)]
*  What's even crazier is no matter how many economists across the political spectrum say this is a recipe for disaster, no matter how many politicians oppose the idea, Trump can impose tariffs unilaterally as president without Congress. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=532.0s)]
*  He doesn't need a bill from them. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=545.0s)]
*  That's what he did the first time in the trade war with China. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=547.0s)]
*  And the sheer insanity of what he's proposing, trillions and trillions of dollars in new tariffs is not really being grappled with by the media. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=550.0s)]
*  It is being called out by Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=559.0s)]
*  My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump's sales tax, which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=562.0s)]
*  Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about four thousand dollars more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=574.0s)]
*  President Trump, I'll give you two minutes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=594.0s)]
*  First of all, I have no sales tax. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=596.0s)]
*  That's an incorrect statement. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=598.0s)]
*  She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=599.0s)]
*  No, no, no, that's the thing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=603.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=605.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=606.0s)]
*  The tariffs on the other country is a sales tax on you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=607.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, I don't think, understands his own economic plan, a plan that even Republican economists say is a sales tax on Americans, a plan that already devastated American agriculture and turned American farmers from farmers into welfare recipients the first time around. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=610.0s)]
*  But if he's elected, no one can stop him from making the same mistakes all over again. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=624.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rNxvt0TcQ&t=633.0s)]
