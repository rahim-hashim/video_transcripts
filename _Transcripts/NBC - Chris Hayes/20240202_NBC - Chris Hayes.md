# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 2  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today the U.S. military beginning long expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=0.0s)]
*  military campaign in Syria and Iraq against Iranian proxy forces and the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=8.96s)]
*  Guard Corps, sometimes known as the Quds Force. The strikes were in retaliation for that drone [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=15.3s)]
*  attack over the weekend, which left three American Army reservists dead and dozens more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=20.64s)]
*  injured in their base in Jordan. Those strikes that killed Americans were themselves part of a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=25.74s)]
*  series of exchanges between various militant groups backed by Iran and U.S. forces that have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=30.74s)]
*  followed the October 7th Hamas attack in Israel and Israel's subsequent counteroffensive in Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=36.06s)]
*  Right now what you are seeing is footage of one of today's strikes on your screen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  For an Iraqi security official, that that you're seeing get hit there is a weapons warehouse in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=46.94s)]
*  western Iraq that belongs to an Iraqi Shiite militia known as Qatib Hezbollah. According to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=52.14s)]
*  U.S. Central Command, quote, U.S. military forces struck more than 85 targets, which numerous [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=58.22s)]
*  aircraft, which include with numerous aircraft to include long range bombers flown from the United [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=64.38s)]
*  States. The airstrikes employed more than 125 precision munitions. The facilities that were [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=69.1s)]
*  struck included command and control operations centers, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=75.18s)]
*  and unmanned air vehicle storages and logistics and munitions supply chain facilities of militia [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=80.78s)]
*  groups and their Iranian Revolutionary Guard sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=86.62s)]
*  and coalition forces. In a call with reporters, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=91.9s)]
*  provided more details about those strikes. U.S. military forces struck more than 85 targets [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=98.06s)]
*  at seven facilities utilized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the militant groups [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=105.18s)]
*  that they sponsor. Three of the facilities are in Iraq. Four of them are in Syria. Numerous [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=111.26s)]
*  aircraft including B-1 bombers dispatched from the United States were involved in this operation, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=117.9s)]
*  firing more than 125 precision guided munitions over the course of about 30 minutes. Target [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=123.18s)]
*  facilities included command and control centers as well as headquarters buildings and intelligence [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=129.9s)]
*  centers, rocket, missile, and drone storage facilities, and logistics and munitions supply [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=134.14s)]
*  chain facilities. In a statement, President Joe Biden said quote, our response began today. It [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=140.22s)]
*  will continue at times and places of our choosing. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin went a step [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=145.42s)]
*  further confirming quote, the president has directed additional actions to hold the Iranian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=150.7s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard and affiliate militias accountable for their attacks on U.S. and coalition [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=155.26s)]
*  forces. Austin also echoed President Biden's sentiment the U.S. is not seeking conflict in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=160.38s)]
*  the Middle East, but it is difficult to read today's strikes as anything other than an escalation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=165.5s)]
*  Since the October 7th Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent bombardment and ground invasion into [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=170.7s)]
*  Gaza, we have seen a series of conflicts and skirmishes break out across the wider Middle East. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=176.06s)]
*  You see them there on the map. That includes fire exchange between Israel and Hezbollah fighters in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen seizing commercial ships in the Red Sea and U.S. strikes in response, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=185.98s)]
*  militia groups in Iraq and Syria targeting American station there, all of which culminated [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=192.14s)]
*  in that fatal strike against American reservists in Jordan over the weekend. It was that last [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=197.1s)]
*  incident that President Biden retaliated against today. It was among the most drastic responses [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=202.7s)]
*  the U.S. could have taken save for striking targets within Iran itself. And with more retaliatory [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=207.33999999999997s)]
*  action confirmed for the future, there is, of course, a risk of the conflict expanding further. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=212.78s)]
*  NBC News Chief International correspondent Keir Simmons is live in Erbil, Iraq tonight with the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=217.66s)]
*  latest. Keir, what do you have? Well, Chris, this was clearly an escalation by the Biden [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=222.14s)]
*  administration. We haven't seen something like this for years, but it was also limited. So the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=230.54s)]
*  strikes and we're counting here because we haven't been told exactly by the U.S. where they took [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=235.66s)]
*  place. We're counting here on regional reporting. But the strikes appear from that to have taken [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=240.86s)]
*  place in eastern Syria along the border between Syria and Iraq, along Ambar province to the place [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=245.9s)]
*  where it meets the Jordanian border and that tower 22 where those three U.S. military service men and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=252.7s)]
*  women were killed. Now, eastern Syria, Ambar province, folks watching who know their history [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=259.02s)]
*  will remember that those are the kinds of places, particularly Ambar province, for example, where the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=265.74s)]
*  U.S. fought battles during the invasion of Iraq and then, of course, for ISIS. So now quite [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=270.62s)]
*  extraordinary, isn't it? So tonight to have the U.S. bombing Iranian backed militia in those same [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=276.86s)]
*  places tells you something about U.S. foreign policy over the years. But now what we are seeing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=284.06s)]
*  is clearly an effort to send a message to Tehran by targeting those Iranian backed militias, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=289.74s)]
*  particularly in areas closest to tower 22. They could have gone, for example, to Iranian [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=296.38000000000005s)]
*  Revolutionary Guards stations around Damascus airport. So far it doesn't appear they've done [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=304.06s)]
*  that. They don't appear to have hit high value targets. So it is restricted, but it is escalatory. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=308.54s)]
*  And the question is going to be how Iran responds now. Just to give you a picture here in Iraq, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=315.42s)]
*  in Ambar province, they also have hit, according to the Popular Mobilization Forces, a site where [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=322.78s)]
*  they are. They are also Iran backed, but they're also connected to the Iraqi government. And that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=330.62s)]
*  just gives you a picture, the Iraqi government, as it would do, complaining tonight about its [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=336.14s)]
*  sovereignty being violated. But the fact that the U.S. felt it needed to hit this particular group [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=340.46s)]
*  connected to the Iraqi army tells you something. This place, this Iraq now, is both a partner of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=345.66s)]
*  the U.S. and of Iran. It looks in both directions. And the challenge for the Biden administration [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  has been to have an impact without pushing Iraq closer to Iran, which is exactly what Iran wants [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=358.62s)]
*  to push the U.S. out of this region. Incredibly difficult judgments for the Biden administration [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=365.66s)]
*  to make. And we'll see what effect it's had as the days play out and we see what else happens. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=369.98s)]
*  Let me just follow up on that, Kyras. You are there in Erbil, Iraq, in the north of Iraq, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=376.06s)]
*  in the Kurdish region there. It is the case that the Shiite majority of Iraq controls the government. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  It is closely aligned with Iran. And then there are a whole bunch of militia groups [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=388.38000000000005s)]
*  that are essentially allied with that government throughout Iraq. The U.S. also maintains a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=392.14000000000004s)]
*  relationship with that government. Tonight, the Iraqi government, and we're talking about these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=398.70000000000005s)]
*  strikes against Iran-backed militias. But important to just stress this, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=402.22s)]
*  they're physically happening in the countries of Syria and the sovereign nation of Iraq. Tonight, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  Iraqi officials complaining about the violation of their sovereignty and presumably some political [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=411.34000000000003s)]
*  ramifications, as you noted, within Iraq tonight for once. That's right. And that's the kind of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=416.38000000000005s)]
*  difficult calculation that the Biden administration would have had to have made, Chris, that there is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=424.70000000000005s)]
*  that risk. Because remember that what Iran's strategy is, is to put pressure on Israel and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=430.14s)]
*  try and push the U.S. out of this region. So if this has the impact on the Iraqi government, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  that it becomes more determined that it shouldn't have U.S. here, well, that's playing into Iran's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=440.86s)]
*  strategic objectives. Another point to make, though, too, I think, Chris, the scale of this [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=446.86s)]
*  and the breadth of it, although it is limited, puts the spotlight on just the extent to which [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  Iran has spread its tentacles here, is embedded here, particularly in Syria, and has got to the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=459.26s)]
*  point now where it is around Damascus, closer and closer to the border with Israel. And I think what [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  we're really seeing illuminated is one of these regional challenges, which is about actually the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=472.14s)]
*  standoff between Iran and the U.S. and Iran and Israel. And fundamentally, and I know you've [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  talked about this many times, the U.S. doesn't seem to be seen from here, the U.S. doesn't seem [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=483.42s)]
*  to be able to decide whether it wants to confront Iran or whether it wants to negotiate Iran, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=489.1s)]
*  what the best strategy is to try to change Iran's strategic goals. And I think there's a question [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=494.38s)]
*  tonight over whether this action, substantial though it is, will move the needle for Tehran. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  Great, great reporting, as always. Keir Simmons, so appreciative to have you reporting live from [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=505.74s)]
*  Air Reel Iraq tonight. Thank you so much. Joining me now is John Brennan, former director of the CIA, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=510.3s)]
*  and Mr. Brennan, I'd love for you to just tell us your read on the calculation, the very careful [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=518.14s)]
*  calculation here tonight on these strikes after the death of three Americans in Jordan, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=525.18s)]
*  amidst a series of back and forth strikes that have happened prior to that, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=532.06s)]
*  how to think about what we're seeing tonight and how that narrow calculation is being made. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, Chris, the Biden administration made a determination that the recent attack against [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=541.02s)]
*  U.S. forces in Jordan that resulted in three deaths and over 50 wounded was a tripwire that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=547.9s)]
*  requires the United States to push back forcefully against these militias, these proxy forces of Iran [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=553.74s)]
*  that have continued to carry out these attacks against U.S. presence in the region, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=561.26s)]
*  whether it be in Syria or Iraq, as well as in Yemen against the targets in the Red Sea. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=565.58s)]
*  And so therefore, there was a decision made that enough is enough and that they need to severely [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=571.6600000000001s)]
*  degrade the capabilities of these proxy forces. Now, these strikes took place in areas of Syria [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=577.5s)]
*  and Iraq that basically are tribal areas. And the central governments in Baghdad and Damascus really [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=582.94s)]
*  have no control over these areas, which has allowed Iran to be able to cultivate these [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=588.38s)]
*  relationships with these tribes, giving them money, giving them weapons, material, training, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=593.18s)]
*  other types of things so that they're able to use these tribes, these militias, for their own [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=597.42s)]
*  purposes. And so that's why if the Iraqi government and the Syrian government are not going to limit [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=601.9799999999999s)]
*  what these groups do and are not going to prevent them from carrying out attacks against U.S. forces [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=607.9s)]
*  in the region, the United States has to make these decisions on its own. Now, I know that the Biden [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=612.38s)]
*  administration notified the Iraqi government before they took strikes and was very clear from [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=617.3399999999999s)]
*  the statement that came out from Central Command today that they were targeted against those [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=621.74s)]
*  elements that were used to carry out the attack against U.S. forces in Jordan, but also those [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=625.98s)]
*  where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Al-Quds Force, which is the component that has worked [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=632.46s)]
*  with these groups over the course of time, they were purposely targeted because it is Iranian [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=638.3s)]
*  support for these groups that allows and enables these groups to carry out these strikes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=644.78s)]
*  The groups you're talking about, there was some discussion about, I guess my question is, is there [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=650.46s)]
*  a calculation on lethality here? Obviously, the tripwire is the loss of three American [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=657.02s)]
*  reservists in that Tower 22 base in Jordan. Is there a calculation here? Again, this is sort of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=663.1s)]
*  macabre calculation of essentially life for life, eye for eye, but is there a level of lethality [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=668.86s)]
*  intentionally targeted as the means of deterrence? Well, I think it's more to degrade and to take [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=676.62s)]
*  away the capability of these forces to carry out these strikes. Yes, there will be casualties. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=684.7800000000001s)]
*  There'll be individuals who'll be killed. There'll be Iranians from members of the Al-Quds Force that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=690.22s)]
*  are embedded with these forces, but it's clear that I think the main element within Iraq in this area [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  that is a proxy force of Iran is Qatayib Hezbollah. And it's been many years that Iran has been able [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=701.34s)]
*  to develop relations with them and continue to give them the capability to carry out these attacks. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=707.02s)]
*  So the Biden administration, I think, central command was very, very purposeful and careful [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=712.46s)]
*  in terms of where they were targeting. The number of strikes was not that large. The number of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=716.94s)]
*  munitions used, clearly there was large munitions. The B-1 bombers came in to destroy the capabilities [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=721.34s)]
*  to take away the training places, the weapons depots, the command and control centers, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=727.42s)]
*  maybe the underground tunnels where they store some of these munitions and other [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=732.38s)]
*  material. So I think what they're trying to do is degrade the capabilities, take away [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  the ability of these groups to carry out these attacks. Yes, there will be [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=740.54s)]
*  individuals that are killed, but it's not to avenge the death of U.S. soldiers. It is to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=744.2199999999999s)]
*  mitigate the dangers and the risks that these groups pose to our forces. All right. Former CIA [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=749.5s)]
*  Director John Brennan, it's great to have you on tonight. I appreciate it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=755.02s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. Coming up as the U.S. retaliates for the death of three service members, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=760.14s)]
*  Senator Tammy Baldwin and Congressman, sorry, Senator Tammy Duckworth and Congressman Jason [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=764.46s)]
*  Crowe, both Iraq war veterans. Join me next. Tonight, the United States launched retaliatory [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=770.62s)]
*  strikes for the killing of three American soldiers last weekend. The strikes took place in Iraq and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=780.46s)]
*  Syria on targets used by militias funded by Iran. In a statement about the operation, President Joe [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=784.7s)]
*  Biden delivered a clear warning, quote, The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=790.86s)]
*  or anywhere else in the world. Let all those who might seek to do us harm know this. If you harm an [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=795.0200000000001s)]
*  American, we will respond. Earlier today, President Biden joined the grieving families of those fallen [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=800.38s)]
*  soldiers for the most solemn ceremonies, the dignified transfer of their remains. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  Sergeants William Rivers, Kennedy Sanders and Brianna Moffat were members of the Army Reserved [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=811.9799999999999s)]
*  based at Fort Moore, Georgia. A cousin described 46 year old Rivers as a family man with a heart [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=817.74s)]
*  of gold who loved serving his country. He leaves behind a wife and a teenage son. 24 year old [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=823.9s)]
*  Kennedy Sanders was a talented athlete who coached middle school basketball when she was not on [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=829.9s)]
*  military duty. Her father, Sean, told NBC News he was very proud of his daughter, had a bright [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=834.62s)]
*  future in front of her. Brianna Moffat was proud to follow in her mother's footsteps to join the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=839.58s)]
*  military. Her parents called her, quote, The light of everything. She walked into a room and she [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=844.7800000000001s)]
*  commanded attention. Moffat, seen there, was just 23 years old. Senator Tammy Duckworth is a Democrat [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=848.86s)]
*  of Illinois who serves on the Armed Services Committee, also retired Army Lieutenant Colonel [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=855.5s)]
*  and Iraq War veteran. And she joins me now. Senator, your reaction to the news we're getting tonight [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=859.9000000000001s)]
*  about the sort of scope and targets of this set of American strikes and retaliation for what [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=867.02s)]
*  happened this weekend? You know, I thought it was a good balance of balancing, showing the might of [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=873.98s)]
*  the United States military and what we can do. I mean, the breadth of the number of targets, 85 of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=882.54s)]
*  them, the swiftness of the attack, it only took 30 minutes. But also with the president's very [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=888.54s)]
*  careful statements saying that, you know, we do not seek war in the Middle East. I think it sent [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=895.42s)]
*  a strong message, but also said, OK, we don't want war. But if you want to go to war, this is what we [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=900.78s)]
*  got. And I thought it was a nice balancing act on the part of the president. I wanted to get your [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=905.3399999999999s)]
*  thoughts as someone who served in combat in Iraq. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, it was just about [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=913.26s)]
*  20 years ago this year that your helicopter was shot down there while you were working as a combat [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=918.7s)]
*  pilot. That 20 years later that we face a situation in which that government is, you know, very bound [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=926.5400000000001s)]
*  to Iran, that there are running back militias there, and that we are, here we are on the year 2024, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=933.6600000000001s)]
*  striking inside Iraq. Yeah. And we only just voted to repeal the AUMF, the Authorization for Use of [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=939.5s)]
*  Military Force, last year that went all the way back to the beginning of the war. And we still have [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=948.06s)]
*  one that is still in effect. So my thoughts are really worried about what some of my Republican [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=953.26s)]
*  colleagues, you know, right after the tragedy of our three heroes being killed, so many of my [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=957.9s)]
*  Republican colleagues just made these really inflammatory statements like, take it to Tehran, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  you know, calling recklessly for retaliation. And I certainly want to retaliate. I'm heartbroken that [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  our service members were killed and so many were wounded. But also we have to be careful that we [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=976.7800000000001s)]
*  don't escalate ourselves into another war, another endless war. That's right. This year is my 20th [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=981.0200000000001s)]
*  year since I was wounded in Iraq. And it took, you know, 19 years for us to repeal the AUMF. So we [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=987.1s)]
*  have to be very careful that as we respond, we don't get ourselves into the path with no off ramp [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=992.46s)]
*  towards a war in the Middle East yet again. The best thing we can do to honor our service members [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=999.58s)]
*  is to make sure we don't send them into harm's way in a thoughtless manner. Do you have thoughts [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1003.66s)]
*  about just where we are in the broader trajectory of the conflict there? Obviously, there is long [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1009.8199999999999s)]
*  standing context for the conflict, of course, which is the aftermath of the Iraq War, the sort [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1016.62s)]
*  of standing up of a variety of Iranian proxies throughout the region, what they call an axis of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1021.74s)]
*  resistance. And that's part of this context here. Part of it is the more is the closer [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  context, of course, of the Hamas attack on Israel October 7th and the ongoing Israeli [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1033.18s)]
*  counteroffensive and what that has done to the region and how that has incited some, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1037.3400000000001s)]
*  you know, escalation by a variety of those Iranian groups. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1044.78s)]
*  Well, Iran has been backing all of these groups all over. And I think what this shows us is the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1049.5s)]
*  breadth of their involvement. And remember that it's not just the terrorists that are carrying out [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1054.54s)]
*  these groups, but Iran is now backed by opposition leaders who have been elected to the Iraqi [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1061.5s)]
*  parliament. You know, when we help the Iraqis set up, write the constitution and set up a new [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1066.94s)]
*  parliament and their Supreme Court in Iraq after the war, I don't think we ever dreamt that Iran [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1071.02s)]
*  would actually be a proxy actor with people elected to the Iraqi parliament. It's absolutely [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1077.74s)]
*  astonishing. And I think where we are right now is a reaction to the ongoing efforts to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1084.22s)]
*  normalize relations between Israel and other Middle Eastern nations. You have the Abraham Accords, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1090.54s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Israel were on the verge of signing an agreement when Hamas attacked. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1096.22s)]
*  I think all of these things are connected. But I think this retaliation tonight by the president [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1100.38s)]
*  sent a very strong message to Iran that enough is enough and you need to call back some of these [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1106.06s)]
*  proxy groups. All right. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, thank you so much for making time [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1112.06s)]
*  for us. I appreciate it. My pleasure. Congressman Jason Crowe is a Democrat of Colorado who sits in [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1117.4199999999998s)]
*  the Foreign Affairs Committee. He's a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1123.1799999999998s)]
*  Afghanistan. And he joins me now. Congressman, your thoughts on the strikes that have been [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1126.62s)]
*  announced tonight? Good evening. I agree with Senator Duckworth that this appears to be a good [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1133.1s)]
*  response that shows strength, shows capability and retaliates for the killing of our soldiers, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1141.26s)]
*  but also avoids de-escalation. So that's the near-term analysis. But the long-term analysis, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1147.5s)]
*  also as Senator Duckworth aptly pointed out, must be, how does this serve our longer-term [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1153.82s)]
*  interests? What is the end game here? Most of my adult life, we've been fighting and have had [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1160.54s)]
*  conflict in the Middle East. So we very clearly need a different model. We've been walking around [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1165.66s)]
*  carrying a hammer for the last couple of decades. Every problem looks like a nail. So what does a [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1171.66s)]
*  different model look like that can actually de-escalate and change the entire scenario [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1175.98s)]
*  long-term for the Middle East? And that's the discussion that's really important for Congress [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1182.38s)]
*  to be engaged in. Let me ask you what that is. I mean, I was struck tonight, you said, for most [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1185.74s)]
*  of your life, I think we're around the same age, Congressman. And I remember that the Gulf War was [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1191.26s)]
*  when I was 11 in 1990. I'm 44 now, so 33 years that some sort of US military activity directed [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1196.22s)]
*  at Iraq has been happening, three-quarters of my life. When you say changing that model, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1203.74s)]
*  what do you mean by that? Well, we, for a very long time, have over-reli-ed, this is my opinion, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  we have over-reli-ed on military force. And the problem with that, and don't get me wrong, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1218.22s)]
*  there is absolutely a time and place to use military force. And I completely agree with [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1223.02s)]
*  the president in these retaliation strikes that are meant to reestablish deterrence. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1228.78s)]
*  But we continue to do this over and over again. So let's look at how do we readjust the proportion [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1235.9s)]
*  of the various tools in our toolbox, humanitarian, diplomatic, economic, and military. How do we find [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1242.54s)]
*  a better proportion and how do we leverage all of those tools to better achieve an end that we, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1250.06s)]
*  frankly, have not been able to achieve? So my argument is, my thesis here is, we have not [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1256.62s)]
*  brought the right proportion of those tools to bear, and that's why we continue to have to [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1261.6599999999999s)]
*  use military force over and over again here. Let me follow up and ask about diplomatic channels [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1266.3s)]
*  with Iran. Obviously, there's a number of interesting diplomatic channels that have [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1271.8999999999999s)]
*  developed recently. There's a Qatari channel through which US negotiators, including the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1274.94s)]
*  director of CIA, William Burns, has been involved in negotiations with the Israelis and Hamas [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1283.9s)]
*  representatives through the Qataris for some kind of exchange of cessation of hostilities for mass [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1290.54s)]
*  release of hostages in Gaza. There is no real Iran channel of diplomacy active right now. There [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1297.34s)]
*  was one that tried to revive that nuclear deal that the Trump administration ripped up. There's [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1308.54s)]
*  some channel through the Qataris, but do you think that's something that's needed lacking? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1313.58s)]
*  Well, I'm almost always a proponent of establishing some method of communication [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1320.6999999999998s)]
*  to avoid misunderstanding, because when you have very large and capable militaries that have [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1325.34s)]
*  significant capabilities that are operating in close proximity to one another, a very easy way [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1331.26s)]
*  for this to go awry is for actions to be misunderstood. And that's why making sure that [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1336.78s)]
*  the retaliatory strikes that the administration took today were carefully calibrated, were strategic, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1342.54s)]
*  and were surgical, because a misunderstanding is exactly how this turns into a larger Middle East [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1349.5s)]
*  conflict with very large militaries fighting each other directly. And when you have not a few [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1354.62s)]
*  soldiers being killed, which is a terrible tragedy in and of itself, but you have very large numbers [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1360.78s)]
*  of soldiers meeting themselves on the battlefield, which is what we want to avoid at all costs here [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1367.1s)]
*  if we can. Let me ask you this, a slightly political question or a question about your [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1371.82s)]
*  constituents in your district. How top of mind is this for the folks that you represent in the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1377.6599999999999s)]
*  third district of Colorado? Well, it's very top of mind. I have the honor of representing one of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1383.58s)]
*  the most diverse congressional districts in the nation. And 20% of my constituents were born [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1390.6999999999998s)]
*  outside of the United States. I have 130 languages spoken in my community. I have a large Jewish [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1396.3799999999999s)]
*  community. I have a large Arab community. I have a Palestinian diaspora. So I've been engaging [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1402.62s)]
*  with these folks weekly over the last couple of months. I engage with them all the time the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1408.38s)]
*  last couple of years, but I've been doing extra the last few months to make sure that I'm listening [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1414.0600000000002s)]
*  to them, I'm hearing their concerns, and we figure out how we can address this, because it's their [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1419.5s)]
*  lived experience that informs my work. They have families and loved ones who are in harm's way, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1424.38s)]
*  whether it be in Israel or in Gaza. I held a roundtable a couple of months ago with Palestinian [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1430.7s)]
*  members in my community, and one gentleman told me that he lost 50 members of his family in the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1437.58s)]
*  last couple of months. 50 members. That's one family. It's truly heartbreaking. So that informs [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1443.02s)]
*  my work to make sure that we are putting humanity first. We're putting the protection of civilians [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1448.86s)]
*  first. I'm a former Army Ranger. I served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. What I [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1453.26s)]
*  learned in that time is that the protection of civilians in conflict zones is a mission essential [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1457.98s)]
*  priority. It's not secondary. It's not a distraction. You can achieve no mission, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1464.94s)]
*  and you can make nobody safer unless civilians are protected, and that is a priority. I've done a [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1470.22s)]
*  lot of work for the last couple of years to further that goal. Congressman Jason Kroll of the 6th [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1476.46s)]
*  District, not the 3rd. I misspoke. 3rd is Bobert, 6th District of Colorado. Thank you very much, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1482.46s)]
*  Congressman. Appreciate it. Thank you. We've got much more on tonight's strikes in Iraq and Syria, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1488.6200000000001s)]
*  but first there's also big news on the trials of Donald Trump and the timeline of an insurrection [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1494.38s)]
*  case. That update next. We also have some breaking news tonight on the many legal cases facing Donald [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1498.7800000000002s)]
*  Trump. Judge Tanya Chutkin just formally canceled Trump's election interference trial that had been [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1510.94s)]
*  scheduled for March 4th, writing that, quote, the court will set a new schedule if and when the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1517.1000000000001s)]
*  mandate is returned. The mandate, of course, is the long-awaited decision by the appellate [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1521.74s)]
*  court on the ex-president's claim of absolute immunity from prosecution. Until that ruling, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1527.42s)]
*  which we're still waiting for, we won't know when or if the D.C. trial, arguably the most important [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1533.02s)]
*  trial in recent American history and certainly of the four criminal cases against Trump, will happen. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1539.34s)]
*  Just the kind of delay he wants. Joining me now, Harry Lippman, former Deputy Assistant Attorney [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1545.5s)]
*  General of the Department of Justice. Let's just start with this. I think this is just acknowledging [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1549.82s)]
*  what everyone knew to be true and is essentially just a kind of administrative move, though it [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1554.7s)]
*  highlights the fact that it's now been three or four weeks, I think, and we still don't have [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1559.34s)]
*  anything from the D.C. Circuit. Yeah, 24 days. And yes, it's administrative. The mandate is what one [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1564.62s)]
*  needs for jurisdiction. So in that sense, she says it's not my case anymore, but that if and when [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1571.02s)]
*  kind of sort of wafts off the page, you can almost hear a sigh of frustration with it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1577.58s)]
*  D.C. Circuit, is there an if here? Will I ever see it again? So yes, a kind of checking of a box, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1583.82s)]
*  but a little bit almost frustrated and poignant. Yeah, I got that too. I mean, I don't know. Maybe [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1592.3s)]
*  I'm reading into it, but I thought the if and when was striking. Let's talk about- [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1598.22s)]
*  You didn't need the if. Yeah, that's right. She didn't have to write the if. Yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1602.46s)]
*  Yeah. So let's talk about two other cases here. So one is the- there's another thing we're waiting [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1606.7s)]
*  for, which is the ruling by Judge Ingeron in New York State Court where there's a civil fraud trial. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1613.74s)]
*  And we have a development there, which is that the former finance chief, Alan Weisselberg, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1620.8600000000001s)]
*  is in negotiations to plead guilty to perjury for testimony during this civil fraud trial. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1626.46s)]
*  As part of the agreement, he would have to admit he'd lied on the witness stand in the recent [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1632.78s)]
*  civil fraud trial. It would likely not require to turn in his former boss. The potential agreement [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1636.94s)]
*  could strengthen Bragg's hand before the former president's trial could deter other witnesses [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1641.82s)]
*  in Mr. Trump's circle from lying on the stand. What do you make of this? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1646.06s)]
*  He's become the human piñata for Donald Trump, like the ultimate whatever Trump touches dies, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1651.1s)]
*  right? There's a poignancy to it, and he just sits there and takes it, and he doesn't [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1657.02s)]
*  want to cooperate. It's a pretty interesting- I think the perjury is going to concern his testimony [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1662.62s)]
*  that he didn't really care about the 10,000 versus 30,000 foot discrepancy in the apartment, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1668.78s)]
*  but it's clear that he did. Now that's not part of the case that is now being pursued, but [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1674.9399999999998s)]
*  prosecutors don't like perjury very much, and they came after him. But just what a completely [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1684.2199999999998s)]
*  defeated shell of a man, 76 years old, and just standing there and having to take it for his [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1691.18s)]
*  lifelong loyalty to Fred Trump and Donald Trump. He's the ultimate kind of roadkill here. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's a great point. And also- [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1707.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, one more thing, because of Angoren. Angoren said the 31st, and two weeks later, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1709.5s)]
*  that's a long time. So I think one can surmise that both this fact, and he doesn't know any more [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1716.3s)]
*  than we do. They don't tell him in the DA's office, but that Weisselberg may plead guilty. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1722.06s)]
*  And also the report we got from Judge Jones, which set out all these ongoing problems, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1728.7s)]
*  those may well figure in Angoren's calculation of penalty need for certain protections and the like. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1734.62s)]
*  So I think that's the most likely explanation for why we're going two more weeks. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1742.62s)]
*  Okay. Finally here on the Georgia case, of course, allegations of impropriety [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1747.1799999999998s)]
*  leveraged in both the press and also in a court filing against District Attorney Funny Willis [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1752.1399999999999s)]
*  for what the opposing counsel had contended was an improper relationship with Nathan Wade, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1756.9399999999998s)]
*  who's an attorney, who's been an outside attorney brought into the office. Her filing today, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1763.8999999999999s)]
*  basically, top line is yes, they have had a relationship. No, it is an improper, it doesn't [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1768.78s)]
*  rise to any level of anything that should affect her involvement in the case. What do you think of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1775.58s)]
*  her filing? It's 100% true under Georgia law. She needed to do it. The law of these kinds of scandals [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1780.94s)]
*  is get it all out early. The thing is by now there's sort of blood in the water. You have one of [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1788.38s)]
*  these, you know, phony baloney special investigative commissions in Georgia, no other than Jim [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1793.26s)]
*  Jordan subpoenaed her today. McAfee is going to have a hearing on the 15th and oddly, even before [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1800.3799999999999s)]
*  this, he started an evidentiary hearing. So what sort of evidence is it going to take? That could [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1807.18s)]
*  be a bit of a circus and this could continue even though it should be the end of it. There's no [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1812.78s)]
*  conflict here. Okay. Harry Libman. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chris. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1817.74s)]
*  Up next, much more on the U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria. The role Iran has played [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1822.94s)]
*  in the Middle East. We'll be right back. U.S. military aircraft have struck more than 85 targets [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1827.18s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq in retaliation for the drone attack last weekend that killed three American [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1837.18s)]
*  soldiers. This could be the beginning of a long campaign in the Middle East. The White House is [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1841.9s)]
*  simultaneously trying to push through a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. President Biden saying [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1847.66s)]
*  today that the retaliatory strikes quote, will continue at times and places of our choosing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1853.8200000000002s)]
*  NBC News foreign correspondent Matt Bradley is in Tel Aviv for us tonight. Matt, of course, the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1858.94s)]
*  October 7th attack by Hamas into Israel, the Israeli response, the kind of [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1865.1000000000001s)]
*  sort of first domino here for this round of strikes and counter strikes throughout the region. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1869.5s)]
*  There has been a lot of negotiations happening, a lot of discussion about a possible deal, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1875.42s)]
*  the U.S. sending CIA Director William Burns into talks. What's the latest? How do these [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1880.22s)]
*  strikes and escalation look from that perspective there in Tel Aviv? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1885.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the way that the Israelis are going to look at this is as the holistic approach that [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1891.42s)]
*  Iran has been taking to the entire region. And I think you guys have probably spoken about this, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1896.38s)]
*  the so-called axis of resistance, all of these proxy groups and in certain cases, nations [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1900.0600000000002s)]
*  that are backed by Iran. And we're talking about Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1905.34s)]
*  these popular mobilization forces in Iraq and Syria. You know, and so Israel has constantly [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1909.8999999999999s)]
*  been beating the drum saying that Iran is the problem here. And they've been doing this really [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1917.1799999999998s)]
*  for the better part of our generation. So and Hamas is part of that. Hamas also benefits from [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1921.82s)]
*  Iranian largesse. But when it comes to these strikes, now we're about to see Antony Blinken [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1927.5s)]
*  making his next trip to the region, his fifth trip. This is the U.S. Secretary of State. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1933.74s)]
*  He's going to be traveling all around to here in Israel, but also to American allies like Egypt [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1937.66s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia, countries that are very, very sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1943.18s)]
*  They are close U.S. allies. All of them, almost all of them, are inimical to Iran. They see Iran [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1949.5s)]
*  now, perhaps more than ever, as one of the primary threats. Because remember that even [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1955.98s)]
*  when that October 7th attack happened, we were in the midst of a normalization of diplomacy [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1961.02s)]
*  between Israel and the rest of the Arab world. The October 7th attacks and Israel's counterattacks [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1966.7s)]
*  and incursion into the Gaza Strip interrupted all of that. But we're about to see Antony Blinken [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1972.1399999999999s)]
*  traveling around, doing his shuttle diplomacy, shoring up U.S. support among U.S. allies who [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1977.74s)]
*  might be very frustrated with U.S. support for Israel. But really what we're seeing in [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1983.42s)]
*  the beginning here, if the Biden administration gets its way, is a redrawing and a realigning [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1988.38s)]
*  of the Middle East in the U.S.'s favor from the ashes of this conflict in the Gaza Strip. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=1993.9s)]

*  contributing writer and columnist in New Yorker who's covered Iran in the Middle East for decades. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2023.1799999999998s)]
*  Her latest article discusses how 10 Middle East conflicts are converging into one big war. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2027.26s)]
*  They all join me now. Robin, let me just start with you and just set some context here, because [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2032.78s)]
*  I know this is sort of an important part of this context. We talk about Iranian proxy groups, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2036.78s)]
*  Iranian influence throughout the region. And you've spent time with these groups and with [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2042.54s)]
*  Americans in these groups, which is this is all sort of aftermath of the Iraq War, right? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2048.7s)]
*  Iraq and Iran are mortal enemies. They fight one of the bloodiest wars of the last 50 years. Of [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2053.5s)]
*  course, the U.S. comes in. We get rid of Saddam Hussein regime change. This creates a power [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2059.74s)]
*  vacuum. And the Shia majority in Iraq rises to power in that government. The Arabs bring the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2064.7s)]
*  subsequent Syrian civil wars, produce this kind of huge parts of the region that are essentially, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2072.22s)]
*  as Kirsten was saying, sort of outside of the reach of central governments. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2078.4599999999996s)]
*  On the ground, what does it look like in these areas where precisely these groups are operating? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2083.18s)]
*  Well, it's not just since the Iraq invasion. It's really going back 40 years since the birth of [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2089.58s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, which in 1982 carried out a military strike, the largest loss of U.S. military [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2095.02s)]
*  life in a single incident since Iwo Jima in World War II. So one of the problems is the United [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2101.18s)]
*  States is playing the short game and Iran is playing the long game. We're 250 years old and [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2106.2999999999997s)]
*  it's 2500 years old. It's willing to invest in the long term to get the United States to leave the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2112.14s)]
*  entire region. And it has empowered these groups, some of which operate in terms of their own agenda, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2118.3799999999997s)]
*  even as they share that strategic goal of getting the Americans out. But today it's [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2124.46s)]
*  looks like the Americans have responded extensively with 85 strikes. But the reality is [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2131.02s)]
*  Iranian militias have been doing this for a very long time at great cost to American life, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2139.2599999999998s)]
*  to American allies. And the question of the day is who's stronger in the region, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2143.82s)]
*  America and its allies or Iran and its allies? And I think that's unclear. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2148.3s)]
*  There was, Matt was talking about this briefly, the defining axis of the region [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2152.86s)]
*  until fairly recently was this sort of Sunni-Shi'a, Saudi Arabia-Iran conflict. And it's sort of [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2159.74s)]
*  getting worse and worse. And you saw Yemen is the sort of site of it between the different proxies [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2165.66s)]
*  they were fighting. There was somewhat remarkably a kind of Chinese struck deal between the two that [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2170.14s)]
*  really did lower the tensions between those two. And it was that axis of conflict that Matt was [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2175.9s)]
*  recognizing that was sort of creating a lot of these new alliances, the ideas of the Gulf states [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2180.94s)]
*  recognizing Israel, right? Like we have a shared enemy in Iran and Iran incursion and encroachment. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2185.9s)]
*  How does the last several months changed all of that? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2192.06s)]
*  Well, I think, I mean, interestingly, the Chinese broker deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia resulted [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2196.54s)]
*  in ambassadors being exchanged, embassies being opened and much more cordial relations. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2202.94s)]
*  Yeah, a real restoration of ties. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2208.54s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think both Saudi Arabia and Iran recognize it's in their interest to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2211.02s)]
*  have relations. They're always going to be at odds. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2216.62s)]
*  Competitors. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2219.82s)]
*  Competitors, yeah. The two most powerful nations outside of Israel in the Middle East. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2220.46s)]
*  But I think that the last few months have obviously shown that Iran's power and influence [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2226.7799999999997s)]
*  is much greater than what most Americans would have thought before. And Hamas is not controlled [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2235.6600000000003s)]
*  by Iran, obviously. It funds much of its budget or some of its budget. A lot of the rest of its [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  budget comes from Qatar and certainly gives weapons and arms to Hamas and is generally very [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2251.1800000000003s)]
*  supportive of Hamas. Wasn't always that way during the Syrian war. They were on opposite sides. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2258.78s)]
*  But so, and there's Sunni and Iran's Shia. So it's a very complicated situation with Hamas, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2265.6600000000003s)]
*  much less complicated with Hezbollah, which are directly really controlled by Iran. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2271.98s)]
*  They are part of the Islamic Republic in many ways. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2276.3s)]
*  And Robin, you made this point that I want to come back to just about that, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2278.86s)]
*  the killing of American Marines in the barracks in Lebanon in 83, which was a sort of horrible [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2283.5800000000004s)]
*  tragedy conclusion of that 82 war, which there's a lot of sort of interesting historical resonances, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2289.42s)]
*  I think now. And I want to get to your great reporting, Aaron Benko, Hooman, Aaron Robin. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2296.2200000000003s)]
*  Stay with me. We have much more to talk about after this quick break. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2300.2200000000003s)]
*  Still with me to discuss the U.S. strike today in the Middle East happened just a few hours ago. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2307.1s)]
*  What it means for the region, Hooman Majd, Aaron Benko and Robin Wright. Aaron, I want to turn to [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2310.7000000000003s)]
*  you and your reporting because we have strikes on, according to U.S. government, 85, I believe, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2314.62s)]
*  different targets. And your reporting was about the fact that one of the challenges for U.S. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2319.8199999999997s)]
*  intelligence was determining the degree to which the actions taken by these Iranian proxies, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2328.94s)]
*  specifically those that hit that base in Jordan, were basically under the sort of direct [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2333.58s)]
*  operational control of the Quds Force, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the group [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2339.5s)]
*  was supported, but they were sort of making this on their own. And the question for U.S. intelligence [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2345.5s)]
*  about how that would calibrate today's action. Yeah, look, I mean, obviously we all know that [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2349.5s)]
*  these groups are well-funded, funded by Iran, trained and equipped by Iran, specifically the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2355.42s)]
*  Quds Force. But we've heard senior officials and the president himself in recent weeks saying, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2361.66s)]
*  from the podium, the risk of miscalculation here is incredibly high. And that's a calculation that [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2369.18s)]
*  the administration has been making themselves in thinking about how to respond to these attacks [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2375.5s)]
*  that we've seen in Iraq and Syria. And then again, after the Tower 22 incident, it is a calculation [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2381.98s)]
*  that is important to that response, figuring out the extent to which the leadership in Iran was [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2388.54s)]
*  potentially involved in, directly involved in some of these attacks. That calculation has become [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2396.2999999999997s)]
*  so important for intelligence officials, given that President Biden and his administration have [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2402.94s)]
*  been so forthright in their comments about not wanting to widen this war. Robin, I want to read [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2408.14s)]
*  for you tonight, the Iraqi army spokesperson. Of course, these strikes happening again in Syria and [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2413.98s)]
*  Iraq, directed at these groups that are associated with Iran, backed by Iran. Iraqi saying, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2419.82s)]
*  written and reported about the strange sort of cheek-bite, jowl existence of US military [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2442.06s)]
*  and essentially Iranian proxy forces inside Iraq. How do you read that statement? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2448.06s)]
*  Well, I think we've gotten to the point that the Iraqis are beginning to ask for the United States [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2454.46s)]
*  to leave. And that's really, at the end of the day, Iran's game plan. I did that in Lebanon, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2458.86s)]
*  forcing the Marines to go. The Israelis occupied Lebanon for 18 years. They, with their tail between [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2463.5s)]
*  their legs, withdrew unilaterally without a peace deal. That's what we're seeing play out with the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2469.66s)]
*  US forces now in Iraq and Syria. That Iran and its allies want to make the United States so unpopular [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2474.38s)]
*  and so threatened that they eventually pull out. The United States is trying to take a strong stand, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2483.26s)]
*  but remember, we only have 900 troops in Syria, 2,500 in Iraq. And they're vulnerable. Look [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2488.2200000000003s)]
*  to what extent we have to go in, flying planes, bombers from the United States, to try to protect [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2495.02s)]
*  them and send a message to government. So the danger is that we may win the short-term [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2500.86s)]
*  message playing out, but we may find that down the road, not in the distant future, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2507.82s)]
*  that we are forced to withdraw because the Iraqis end their cooperation with us. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2512.54s)]
*  Yes. And this question about public opinion in the region, obviously, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2518.2200000000003s)]
*  goes back to the aftermath of that October 7th attack and the sustained Israeli offensive in [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2523.26s)]
*  Gaza and also public opinion in Iraq after tonight's strikes, Homan, where you can accomplish a certain [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2530.2999999999997s)]
*  end militarily in terms of deterrence, but there may be repercussions in that respect. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2538.38s)]
*  Oh, sure. We don't know what the repercussions will be. First of all, we don't know if there [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2543.1s)]
*  are any Iranians killed where Iran will be forced or feel obliged to have some sort of reaction that [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2547.5s)]
*  is beyond just words. We don't know how many other kinds of people, civilians have been killed. So [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2555.02s)]
*  we don't really know what the real, we won't know for a few days what the next steps are going to be. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2560.62s)]
*  All right. Homan, Mahdur to Aaron, Banco, Robin Wright. Thank you all. Thank you. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyeRIjLHwY&t=2564.94s)]
