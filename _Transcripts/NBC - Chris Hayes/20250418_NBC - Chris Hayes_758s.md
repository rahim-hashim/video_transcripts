# Legal battle rages over possible 'imminent' deportations, emergency hearing held
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Sayes. We're watching a developing situation right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=0.0s)]
*  The ACLU says that dozens of immigrants have been notified they are being deported under the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=4.5s)]
*  that 1798 law the Trump administration has invoked. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=11.5s)]
*  It appears those immigrants, some of them, were loaded onto a bus at a detention center in Texas about an hour ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=15.5s)]
*  We watched the motorcade traveling on a Texas highway for a little over an hour and now appears to have arrived at its destination. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=21.5s)]
*  We should say we don't know what this facility is, but the reason this is, we're watching this with bated breath, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=28.0s)]
*  is that the understanding of a lot of advocates for some of those folks, the assumption is, that they may be loaded onto a plane to be flown out of the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=35.0s)]
*  In fact, in just the last hour there was an emergency hearing in federal court. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=44.0s)]
*  It was called by federal judge James Boulberg with the attorneys for the Trump administration, the DOJ, and the ACLU representing some of the people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=48.0s)]
*  who have received notifications of imminent expulsion under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=56.0s)]
*  Now, Boulberg is the judge, you remember, who had ordered the federal government to turn the planes around during the first deportation flights in March and was ignored. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=61.5s)]
*  With a sort of taunting series of posts by El Salvador president Bukele and Marco Rubio. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=72.5s)]
*  The ACLU is basically attempting to get an emergency injunction to stop these imminent deportations because we've all seen how difficult it is to extricate anyone from the facility in El Salvador once they get there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=78.0s)]
*  That said, according to reporting from inside the courtroom and the hearing, Boulberg may not be in a position to stop this flight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=90.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent. She was listening to that hearing and joins me now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=97.0s)]
*  Okay, so there was a bunch of notifications that went to people that are in ICE detention in Texas. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=102.5s)]
*  I just want to show this so people can see what they were given. First of all, it's all in English. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=108.5s)]
*  It says, you've been determined to be a member of Tren de Aragua. Accordingly, under the Alien Enemies Act, you've been determined to be an alien enemy subject to apprehension, restraint, and removal from the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=113.5s)]
*  This, the ACLU said, wait a second, they're going to do this again. When did you judge Boulberg's court and what happened there? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=122.5s)]
*  So Judge Boulberg was telling them today that he doesn't believe that he has power to enter the restraining order that they wanted him to enter. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=129.0s)]
*  What they wanted to leave with tonight was an order that said the government has to give 30 days notice to any alleged Venezuelan gang member that they want to remove from the country and theoretically imprison in El Salvador, subject to the president's March 15th Alien Enemies Act proclamation about Tren de Aragua. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=136.0s)]
*  The one thing that I Chris, I want to flag to you about this notice and something that they raised in court today that Judge Boulberg agreed was problematic is there's nowhere on this form where you can indicate that you intend to challenge this or even that you have the right to challenge it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=154.5s)]
*  It simply says if you desire to make a phone call, you will be permitted to do so. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=168.5s)]
*  So of the facets of this notice that the ACLU argued were constitutionally defective, one of them was the language in which it was presented. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=175.0s)]
*  But the second part was that they argued to Judge Boulberg and Judge Boulberg agreed what the Supreme Court decided on April 7th was that reasonable notice includes a notice that you have an opportunity to be heard. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=182.5s)]
*  And they are arguing that is nowhere to be found on this sheet and they found a sympathetic audience in him there even though he said he was constrained from that court's ruling from doing anything further tonight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=196.5s)]
*  Right. So the habeas concern here, which is a thousand years of legal tradition, right, which is that going back to like English kings, if you detain someone, they have to have some opportunity to challenge their detention. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=206.0s)]
*  Like you got the wrong guy, for instance, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=216.0s)]
*  So this is the box they're checking, apparently, the Trump administration with this notice, ACLU saying in court, that's not good enough. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=218.0s)]
*  But I just want to be clear here, this Judge Boulberg, who had ordered the planes turned around and was defied, had also entered a temporary restraining order saying no further flights to this facility. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=226.0s)]
*  That was vacated by the Supreme Court, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=236.0s)]
*  And that's the grounds under which Judge Boulberg is saying today, I don't have any further authority. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=239.0s)]
*  I don't have any jurisdiction. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=244.0s)]
*  I don't have any jurisdiction to deprive me of jurisdiction. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=245.0s)]
*  They've essentially said to me to the extent that somebody wants to challenge this, they need to bring their own habeas case in the future once they are detained. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=247.0s)]
*  And that necessitates giving them reasonable notice of their detention and an opportunity to be heard. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=255.0s)]
*  But Judge Boulberg also said that ruling essentially means I don't have any jurisdiction or room to do anything tonight with respect to future flights because there's nobody who's detained in the district in which I am sitting right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=261.0s)]
*  And that's part of the Supreme Court's ruling as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=273.0s)]
*  You have to bring your habeas claims in the area where somebody is actually detained. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=275.0s)]
*  I want to just give a little bit of rolling stone reporting here on someone who was born in Venezuela in 2006. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=280.0s)]
*  He's 18 or 19 years old. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=287.0s)]
*  The court record claims a teenager was detained by immigration agents who accused him of being a member of Tren de Aragua after seeing a Facebook photo of him featuring what they alleged to be a pistol, but was actually a water gun. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=289.0s)]
*  Again, all this stuff is like, I don't know. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=299.0s)]
*  I don't know any of the people in there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=302.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're like the most hardened gang criminals in the world or like the sweetest people have nothing to do with it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=303.0s)]
*  But the point is, they're not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=310.0s)]
*  I just want to be clear here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=313.0s)]
*  As far as we understand what's about to happen, if it's going to about to happen, they are not being sent back to a country they come from where they get off a plane as a free citizen, which is what we think of as deportation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=314.0s)]
*  We think what's going to happen and what is being engineered is they're being taken with no real opportunity to challenge that detention immediately taken to one of the most infamous prisons in the Western Hemisphere, where they will have no means to challenge their detention there and will be there for God knows how long. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=325.0s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=344.0s)]
*  There have been representations tonight in connection with tonight's proceeding from attorneys who have either talked to their clients or talked to family members of their clients who say people at the facility in Texas where many of these men are being held were told they will be going to El Salvador. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=345.0s)]
*  Now for the government's part, the government's lawyer tonight said he has been informed that there are no flights planned for this evening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=359.0s)]
*  However, with respect to tomorrow and the court took a recess so that he can make some additional phone calls to educate himself. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=366.0s)]
*  He said there are no flights planned for tomorrow to the best of my knowledge, but we reserve the right to send those flights consistent with the Supreme Court's order. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=373.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=383.0s)]
*  Again, you're looking at a bus that had folks who had been detained in an ICE facility. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=384.0s)]
*  They were put on that bus in Texas. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=389.0s)]
*  They're taken to another location. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=390.0s)]
*  We don't know what that new location is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=392.0s)]
*  We're trying to find that out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=394.0s)]
*  The understanding seems to be that this is possibly the first step in a series of moves to put them on planes to send them to the notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=395.0s)]
*  Lisa, if you can stay with me, I want to bring legal alert who is just literally just arguing before Judge Boasberg in that emergency hearing we were just discussing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=404.0s)]
*  He's the deputy director of the ACLU immigrant rights projects and he joins me now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=413.0s)]
*  Lee, what were you asking the government for in that hearing? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were asking Judge Boasberg to stop the planes until people could have notice. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=422.0s)]
*  It was sort of a very straightforward request. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=429.0s)]
*  Judge Boasberg was absolutely clear that he thought the notices were deficient that people were getting. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=432.0s)]
*  But he said, look, the Supreme Court has said, let this play out in different parts of the country where the men are actually detained and noted that we are also simultaneously asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals located in New Orleans that covers Texas [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=437.0s)]
*  and the United States Supreme Court for emergency relief tonight. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=451.0s)]
*  So he said, I'm going to leave it to them to deal with this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=455.0s)]
*  But he had no doubt that this notice was deficient. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=458.0s)]
*  Notice deficient meaning that the sheet of paper that we've been putting on screen that was given to some of these folks who I believe are essentially your clients here is constitutionally sufficient to give them an opportunity to challenge their detention. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=461.0s)]
*  I mean, before they get sent into a foreign prison from which they may not be able to emerge ever. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=476.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely. That's exactly right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=483.0s)]
*  So, I mean, one thing I just want to stress, which you've already stressed, is that this not being sent back to Venezuela, even if they were being sent back to Venezuela, they would be in danger because they fled Venezuela. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=485.0s)]
*  But they're being sent to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and they may spend the rest of their life there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=496.0s)]
*  And so even if it's a mistake, the Trump administration has said we're not going to we're not going to fix mistakes. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=502.0s)]
*  But what we were saying is, look, you need to be given notice so that you can contest being designated under this wartime authority. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=507.0s)]
*  We went to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court agreed with us and said not only must you be given notice, but it must be sufficient notice to allow you time to get into court to challenge. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=516.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=526.0s)]
*  We then come back down to the courts around the country. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=527.0s)]
*  All the courts thus far have said, yes, we're going to slow things down until the government explains what kind of notice they're giving us in this court. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=531.0s)]
*  Today, the district court decided not to certify a class and issue an injunction, and the government immediately started giving people out this piece of paper. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=540.0s)]
*  And the government is saying, well, this is complies with the Supreme Court. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=549.0s)]
*  The notice is unbelievable. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=553.0s)]
*  Not only is it served in English and even if it was ultimately served later on in Spanish, it doesn't tell people they have the right to contest their designation, how to do it, how long they have to do it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=555.0s)]
*  It says you can make a phone call. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=566.0s)]
*  That's all it says. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=568.0s)]
*  And the government is giving people less than 24 hours, maybe as little as 12 hours to figure this all out. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=569.0s)]
*  It's absolutely an attempt to remove these people without judicial review. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=575.0s)]
*  Exactly what the Supreme Court said is not permitted. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=579.0s)]
*  I've gotten word. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=584.0s)]
*  And again, I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at with those buses, but that it's possible they've gone back to the facility they started at. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=585.0s)]
*  Have you heard that? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=593.0s)]
*  So we are hearing some of that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=596.0s)]
*  We're hearing some of it from you all who are on the ground there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=598.0s)]
*  You know, to the extent they've turned around buses, then that's a success for what we've done today last night and today. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=601.0s)]
*  Stop these flights. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=608.0s)]
*  And we're hoping, though, that we get a ruling from the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court that says everything needs to start up again and people need to be given sufficient notice. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=609.0s)]
*  But to the extent they've turned around the buses now, you know, we'll take that as a victory, but it's very hard to figure out information. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=618.0s)]
*  The government is not telling us anything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=624.0s)]
*  Tried to move these people out quickly before we could get into court. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=626.0s)]
*  You know, that that is really not the way the United States government should be operating. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=630.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just I want to just be clear here about this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=635.0s)]
*  So there's a facility where some of these notifications weren't happening. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=638.0s)]
*  People were taken from that bus and they were they were they were put onto the bus. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=641.0s)]
*  And it was represented in court where that was established as a fact. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=645.0s)]
*  The Department of Justice didn't deny it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=650.0s)]
*  The Department of Justice lawyer said, well, the judge asked the Department of Justice lawyer, if I'm recalling this exchange correctly, what's the reason it kind of looks like you're about to put them on a plane? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=652.0s)]
*  And the Department of Justice lawyer said, well, you know, people get moved around all the time. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=662.0s)]
*  And the judge seemed a little skeptical of that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=666.0s)]
*  Is that a fair characterization? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=670.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=672.0s)]
*  And so this is what's happened. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=673.0s)]
*  When the people were originally sent on March 15th to El Salvador, the Venezuelan men, they were in the Southern District of Texas detention centers in the Southern District of Texas. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=675.0s)]
*  We now have gotten an injunction in the Southern District of Texas that no one can be removed without proper notice and an ability to contest. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=684.0s)]
*  So what does the government do now? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=692.0s)]
*  They detain people in a different part of Texas where the injunction doesn't apply. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=694.0s)]
*  And the government says, well, we just happened to do it there for operational reasons. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=698.0s)]
*  But Venezuelan men were brought all over the country to this one facility, a different facility than they previously were. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=702.0s)]
*  And so the judge was rightly skeptical. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=709.0s)]
*  Well, why all of a sudden are you moving them to a different district where there's no injunction? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=712.0s)]
*  I think, you know, this is a situation where the administration is once again trying to eliminate court review. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=716.0s)]
*  If the administration thinks what they're doing is lawful, then let them put it before a court, argue the merits of it and get a ruling. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=722.0s)]
*  But trying to sneak people out to El Salvador potentially for the rest of their lives, that should not be happening in the United States. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=730.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4LikcvI0U&t=752.0s)]
