# ‘Generational scandal’ Justice Thomas raked in $4M in gifts, new report reveals
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0)
*  We did not get a decision in the Donald Trump immunity case today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  It has now been six weeks since the Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his attempt to steal a 2020 election. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=3.6s)]
*  This means the court is delaying it and they know that that inevitably helps Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=12.1s)]
*  What makes us all the more preposterous is that two justices should have recused themselves from the immunity case already. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=17.6s)]
*  One, Samuel Leto, who had two different coup flags flying outside his two homes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=23.6s)]
*  And Clarence Thomas, whose wife testified to the January 6th Committee about her efforts in support of the coup. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=28.5s)]
*  And that is just the first level at which this court is so deeply compromised. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=35.7s)]
*  New data out today from Fix the Court takes a look at the value of gifts to justices over the past 20 years, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=39.6s)]
*  both disclosed and then undisclosed gifts that were subsequently reported out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=45.8s)]
*  To take you through just a handful that would give you a sense, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=50.1s)]
*  Justice Elena Kagan's calculated to have received gifts valued at just under $1,200. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=52.5s)]
*  That's over 20 years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=57.3s)]
*  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg over $59,000. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=58.8s)]
*  Again, over 20 years, $3,000 a year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=61.3s)]
*  Now, Justice Samuel Leto taking quite a bit more, $170,000 over 20 years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=63.8s)]
*  But none of that is in the zip code of the ballpark of Justice Clarence Thomas, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=70.0s)]
*  whose gifts totaled over $4 million. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=76.1s)]
*  To give you a sense of how that looks in chart form, take a look. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=81.69999999999999s)]
*  Can you see where Justice Thomas is on that bar chart, the big red bar on the left? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=85.6s)]
*  That's Clarence Thomas compared to all the other justices who served during this time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at the New York University School of Law, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  co-host of Strict Scrutiny, podcast along with Leigh Lippman and my wife, Kate Shaw. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=101.5s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=105.3s)]
*  I gotta say, at some level, we knew bits and pieces of this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=107.0s)]
*  There's been an amazing series of pro-public articles, some of which won the Pulitzer [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=111.2s)]
*  about all of the gifts that Thomas has gotten. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  But to see it put out like that, am I wrong? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=117.5s)]
*  It's a generational scandal for the court. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=121.2s)]
*  100%, I think you're exactly right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=124.2s)]
*  We have seen this sort of trickle out piecemeal, but having it splayed out in the aggregate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=125.8s)]
*  really does make clear the expanse of the grift. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=130.4s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the right term for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  It is a grift. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  If you think about Justice Thomas's salary over the course of his time on the court [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=139.4s)]
*  during this period that's been reported, it's roughly equal to the amount of the gifts [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=144.3s)]
*  that fix the court is identified here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=148.9s)]
*  I mean, that is actually quite staggering. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=151.6s)]
*  He's managed to amass two distinct income streams. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=153.8s)]
*  Yeah, we actually ran the math on this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=157.8s)]
*  So the cumulative gross pay over that period is about $4.6, $4.7 million. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=159.8s)]
*  The total gifts is over $4 million. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=164.9s)]
*  He's got two masters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=169.0s)]
*  The servant and two masters, he's working for the American people, and then he's got... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=170.8s)]
*  Well, which American people? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=177.8s)]
*  Let's talk about that because... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=179.8s)]
*  Well, he's been getting paid by the taxpayers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=180.8s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=182.8s)]
*  But it has been said that look where your treasure is for there your heart will be also. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=183.8s)]
*  And it's not surprising that some of the individuals who have been linked to some of these gifts [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=189.2s)]
*  like the Koch Brothers Network, which has had Justice Thomas speak at donor events, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  for example, happens to be deeply involved in a set of major challenges to the regulatory [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=197.5s)]
*  state. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=203.2s)]
*  These are cases we're still waiting for the court to decide, but we already know at least [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=204.2s)]
*  where the Koch Brothers would like Justice Thomas to be. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  I guess now we're just waiting to find out if have they made enough payments on it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=211.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=215.6s)]
*  That's kind of where all of this is going. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=217.0s)]
*  Part of the argument that people will make in defense of Thomas is that, well, he was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=219.4s)]
*  always a conservative anyway, and these are just his friends hooking him up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=224.4s)]
*  No, and it's not unconstitutional to have friends. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=228.4s)]
*  So I want to be very clear about that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=230.9s)]
*  You have a right to have friends, even rich friends. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=233.6s)]
*  But I think where the optics of this become more problematic is that we are seeing individuals [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=236.0s)]
*  essentially donate funds to the court to keep this conservative supermajority in play. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=244.0s)]
*  So there's been a lot of reporting, some of it by the New York Times last year, about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=250.0s)]
*  this Justice Thomas complaining about his small judicial salary, which is actually quite [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=254.0s)]
*  significant relative to what other Americans make, and how maybe he wouldn't stay on the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=259.8s)]
*  court. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=264.0s)]
*  And all of these very wealthy interests were like, no, no, no. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=265.0s)]
*  Let's figure out how to keep you on the court and keep you happy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=268.3s)]
*  And suddenly you see the money start rolling in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=271.3s)]
*  This is a really key point. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=274.5s)]
*  I want to also talk about just the delay on the immunity case here, because it's not surprising. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=276.3s)]
*  I think they tipped their hand when they took so long. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=283.2s)]
*  First, they wouldn't let Jack Smith jump to the Supreme Court, even though we all knew [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=285.3s)]
*  they were going to want to weigh in, even though they did it on COVID cases. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=289.6s)]
*  They did it on student debt. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=292.6s)]
*  Then they took it and they just sat on it for a while before they even announced arguments. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=294.3s)]
*  Then they announced arguments on the very last day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=297.7s)]
*  Now it's been six weeks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=300.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=301.7s)]
*  No, I mean, we knew this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=302.7s)]
*  I've said this a million times. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=303.7s)]
*  By the time the Supreme Court weighs in on this, and I think this court must say at some [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=305.0s)]
*  point that there is no absolute immunity for a president from any criminal liability, but [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=309.3s)]
*  there may be some details about what's private, what's public, what's in the outer scope, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=313.3s)]
*  the hour perimeter of the president's office. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=316.7s)]
*  But whatever they do- [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=318.7s)]
*  A wholly invented doctrine, just to be clear. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=319.7s)]
*  To be clear. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=321.7s)]
*  But whatever they decide, it is purely academic at this point, because they have already in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=322.7s)]
*  effect immunized this defendant, Donald Trump, from liability for these criminal charges. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=328.7s)]
*  That's kind of all that matters right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=335.9s)]
*  I want to also play you this clip from Alito's neighbor who was in the sort of verbal altercation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  with him and his wife, who gave an interview. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=343.7s)]
*  She's making this point about when the flag went up, Alito says that it was about this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=348.5s)]
*  verbal altercation, then he went to a Fox News reporter who just reported exactly what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=354.2s)]
*  he said and didn't, as far as I can tell, do any additional reporting. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=358.42s)]
*  Here's his neighbor talking about the verbal back and forth they had. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  I just want to emphasize that the interaction that happened on February 15th is the one [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=367.26s)]
*  that they're using as an excuse for why they flew the flag, and I really want to hammer [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=372.82s)]
*  home the fact that that happened on February 15th, and their flag went up two or three [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=378.06s)]
*  weeks before that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=384.3s)]
*  That date's confirmed by text messages and a police call. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=386.41999999999996s)]
*  Again, this may just be misremembered, but we still don't know why they were flying the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  flag upside down on Joe Biden's inauguration day, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=395.06s)]
*  We don't. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  My colleague at NYU, Ryan Goodman, has actually made a really good point about this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=400.78s)]
*  Just as Alito last week issued this letter to Senators Durbin and Whitehouse explaining [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=403.94s)]
*  that he was not going to recuse himself from these January 6th related cases, whether because [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  of this flag went up, he has no obligation to recuse himself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  If Ms. Baden is correct that the timeline is wrong, and it seems like the timeline is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=415.42s)]
*  wrong, like there's a real discrepancy between her timeline and Justice Alito's, he's essentially [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=420.14000000000004s)]
*  lied to Congress. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=425.26s)]
*  Ryan Goodman, my colleague, has suggested maybe that is something worth investigating [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=428.26s)]
*  as a criminal matter, but there's a lot going on here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=432.66s)]
*  We haven't had these cases. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=435.18s)]
*  Are they waiting because of the proximity of this scandal to those cases? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=439.82s)]
*  If that's the case, then we've already answered our question as to why Justice Alito should [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=440.82s)]
*  recuse because we're already asking those questions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=445.1s)]
*  It's too complicated. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  It's not impartial. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  Melissa Murray, who is fond of flags as far as I know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  Flagrantly. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=453.74s)]
*  Flagrantly fond of flags. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsZI6kpEQ0&t=454.74s)]
