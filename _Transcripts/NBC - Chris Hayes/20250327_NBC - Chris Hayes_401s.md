# ‘Sound familiar?’: DHS staffer accidentally added reporter to email about ICE raids
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and I want to start with a story reported today by NBC News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=0.0s)]
*  About a national security breach by an employee of the Trump administration [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=4.7s)]
*  Not about the current scandal with the signal group chat, but something had happened back in January [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  Our own Julia Ainsley reports that a longtime official at the Department of Homeland Security sent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=13.9s)]
*  unclassified details about an uncom upcoming ICE raid to colleagues and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=19.86s)]
*  Accidentally included a reporter on the email chain [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=24.54s)]
*  Sounds familiar, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=27.82s)]
*  Except in this case the person questioned owned up the mistake and faced consequences [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=29.62s)]
*  They were put on administrative leave and it looks like they're gonna be stripped of their security clearance [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=33.82s)]
*  So they do know how to hold people accountable for stuff like this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=38.58s)]
*  They just choose when they do that and when they don't to whom they do it and to whom they don't [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=41.74s)]
*  In the signal story everyone involved is trying to lie still their way out of this mess and no one is facing any accountability [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=47.34s)]
*  Although today a federal judge ordered the administration to preserve all communications on the signal group chat [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=55.74s)]
*  This is in response to a lawsuit from a nonprofit watchdog group called American Oversight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  It was the same judge also overseeing the lawsuit about the administration's use of the alien enemies act to justify its [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=65.86s)]
*  rendition of Venezuelan immigrants to a foreign prison [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile Trump's Attorney General Bob Pambandi signaled the Department of Justice [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=77.06s)]
*  Will not be investigating how Trump cabinet members texted classified war plans to the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=81.34s)]
*  it was sensitive information not classified and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=89.18s)]
*  Inadvertently released if you want to talk about classified information talk about what was that Hillary Clinton's home that she was trying to bleach bit [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=94.5s)]
*  Talk about that that classified documents in Joe Biden's garage that Hunter Biden had access to this was not classified information [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=101.82s)]
*  Got a hunter Biden reference in there. Well done attorney general [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=108.86s)]
*  The information was obviously classified. She's lying about it as well [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=114.42s)]
*  It was the details of imminent war plans and the name of CIA officer the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=117.98s)]
*  Precise weapons that will be used and the timing for a surprise attack. Is that secret? Yeah, I think it is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=122.66s)]
*  Attorney general Pambandi is blocking any accountability for one of the biggest and most embarrassing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=129.1s)]
*  intelligence scandals frankly in my lifetime and fundamentally [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=133.74s)]
*  People have to understand this. Okay, take a step back [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=137.22s)]
*  Trump's cabinet is the product of affirmative action for MAGA loyalists [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=141.02s)]
*  And it's easy to lose sight of the stakes here because in many ways this particular scandal has been so comical [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=146.74s)]
*  but it should go without saying that have a bunch having a bunch of incompetent people in charge of national security is really dangerous and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=152.94s)]
*  This is not a thought experiment. We've seen this type of thing before [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=159.62s)]
*  Right-wing governments that were too busy essentially destroying their own country's democratic order to stop a catastrophic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  intelligence failure [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=170.38s)]
*  Take for example Israel under Benjamin Netanyahu in October of 2023 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=171.9s)]
*  Which is to say there is no reason to think these people are doing that job well even though they keep insisting that they are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=179.34s)]
*  the strikes against the Houthis [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=187.78s)]
*  That night were devastatingly effective this military operation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=189.82s)]
*  Against terrorists who have been and continued to attack American service members was extremely successful [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=194.18s)]
*  The mission has been very successful. What is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=200.3s)]
*  The real story here is the overwhelming success of President Trump's decisive military action. It was a very successful [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=206.66s)]
*  Mission understand very clearly the mission was successful. We had a very very successful evening [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=214.7s)]
*  And we've had numerous successful evenings and days in that area. Is that true? Are those claims true? We have no idea [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=220.26s)]
*  The Pentagon claims it struck 30 Houthi targets. That's the group that occupies part of Yemen. That's aligned with Iran [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=228.18s)]
*  But details have been remarkably sparse and the Houthis say that dozens of civilians have been killed which would make sense [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=234.14s)]
*  Given that the signal chat talked about one of the targets being in his girlfriend's building. You think that's a military target? I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=240.5s)]
*  Mean we basically just have to take the administration's word that it was so successful and keep in mind the goal of the strikes in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  Yemen are to get the Houthis to stop attacking trade ships in the Red Sea something they've been doing in protest of the war in Gaza [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=252.34s)]
*  But the Trump administration isn't even close to pulling that off [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=259.02s)]
*  That's still happening. So the mission was a success. I mean take for example the guy in charge in the mission secretary defense Pete Hegs f [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  The former cable news weekend host who shared classified operational details on the group chat regarding the strikes [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=269.86s)]
*  Why I don't know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=276.58s)]
*  If you think he or anyone else is gonna learn from this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=278.9s)]
*  There's no way [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=282.1s)]
*  Unless we see the kind of accountability Pam Bondi is trying to block the kind of accountability [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=283.94s)]
*  The administration found for a low-level staffer in the Department of Homeland Security [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=287.94s)]
*  Republican Senator Jim Risch of Idaho chair of the Foreign Relations Committee claims there will be an investigation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=293.58s)]
*  although I [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=298.98s)]
*  Would not hold your breath and there is growing public outcry for Pete Hegs f to lose his job [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=300.66s)]
*  It is outrageous and it is a leadership failure and that's why secretary Hegs f who undoubtedly transmitted classified [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=307.02s)]
*  sensitive operational [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=315.1s)]
*  Information via this chain must resign immediately. I think there's no question that the secretary of defense [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=317.46s)]
*  Must resign he should be fired. We're in the middle of a fight right now [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=324.9s)]
*  As it relates to Pete Hegs f [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=329.1s)]
*  He needs to resign [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=332.02s)]
*  Or be fired by Donald Trump [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=334.18s)]
*  Even the fine folks on the Fox and Friends couch realize this story [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=337.06s)]
*  Isn't going away on its own [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=341.34s)]
*  Right now we know the pattern they're gonna pound you on the signal story all day [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=343.9s)]
*  You try how do you how do you handle that? Meanwhile, there's so many other things to talk about [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=348.14s)]
*  The president and our entire team have been incredibly transparent [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=353.5s)]
*  We are looking into it to ensure it can never happen again [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  If Pete Hegs f goes whoever replaces him will almost certainly be equally as terrible [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=360.42s)]
*  Although I will say Hegs f is kind of in a category all his own. I mean, he's the most manifestly unqualified [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=365.42s)]
*  Pentagon head we've ever seen [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=372.5s)]
*  But someone the public someone has to draw a line in the sand and hold the people who messed up accountable [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThRnmovVdI&t=386.98s)]
