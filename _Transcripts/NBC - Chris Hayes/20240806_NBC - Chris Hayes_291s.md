# Republican attacks against Walz only making GOP sound ‘more unhinged’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ)
*  I gotta tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made, I just have to say it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You know it, you feel it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=7.44s)]
*  These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=9.0s)]
*  That's what you see. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=11.76s)]
*  That's what you see. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=12.76s)]
*  Governor Tim Walz is the guy who started the whole weird term for how everyone is now describing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=16.6s)]
*  the Republican ticket. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=22.3s)]
*  And this all happened well before it became the vice presidential pick today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Walz, the governor of Minnesota, figured out a way to go at Donald Trump and J.D. Vance [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  in a way that really did get under their skin. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=31.2s)]
*  I mean they have been whining about it a lot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=32.92s)]
*  And so today when Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz as her running mate, it was kind of weird [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=35.3s)]
*  when Republicans were celebrating, suggesting this was a matchup they actually wanted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=39.68s)]
*  Tim Walz's record is a joke. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=46.12s)]
*  He's been one of the most far left radicals in the entire United States government at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=48.76s)]
*  any level. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=53.8s)]
*  I think what it says is that Kamala Harris is running as a San Francisco liberal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  She is governed as a San Francisco liberal and she's chosen a running mate who will be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  a San Francisco style liberal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=63.72s)]
*  I mean I guess a Mankato style liberal is kind of what he is, but it's a weird charge [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=66.24s)]
*  to level against Walz, former social studies teacher, football coach, who actually just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=70.8s)]
*  visited San Francisco for the first time in his life last month. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=75.2s)]
*  Well, wait a second. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=79.4s)]
*  All right, J.D. Vance lived in San Francisco for years and years making big tech money [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=80.76s)]
*  and Silicon Valley connections that bankrolled his political future. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=85.56s)]
*  Like Keith's the guy that actually lived in San Francisco, raised his family there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=89.4s)]
*  But Republicans want you to think Walz, the guy who is a public school teacher in rural [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=93.36s)]
*  Minnesota, the unassuming guy who stuck them with the weird label, is the radical leftist. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  The Trump campaign points to an old interview clip as proof that actually he's a secret [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=103.92s)]
*  Chinese communist. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=108.98s)]
*  I lived in China and as I said, I've been there about 30 times. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  But if someone tells you they're an expert on China, they're probably not telling you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=115.34s)]
*  the truth because it's a complex country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  But it's critically important for us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  I don't fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  That does not seem that unreasonable as a statement. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=127.62s)]
*  By the way, do you remember how Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping love [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=131.34s)]
*  each other, direct quote, and expressed envy that she got to be president for life? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=135.62s)]
*  Trump campaign also hitting walls for dismissing their culture war obsessions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=140.9s)]
*  Tim Walz thinks it's insane. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=145.38s)]
*  People will be upset at Target for partnering with a satanic designer to promote transgender [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=146.74s)]
*  products for kids. Announced on social media. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  Here's the video they included as proof. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=154.58s)]
*  You know, a governor next door to me this week made the case that a rainbow on a T-shirt at [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  Target is destroying our democracy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=162.46s)]
*  That's nonsense. That's just that's just insane. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=164.66s)]
*  And I think most people here in Minnesota agree. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=168.1s)]
*  What do you think comes out of that sounding more radical to you, at least? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=171.06s)]
*  Some Republicans are talking about swift boating walls because he left the National Guard back in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=174.62s)]
*  2005 rather than stay in deploy to Iraq, though I'm not sure. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=179.22s)]
*  Trashing an honorably discharged 24 year army veteran. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  The highest ranking enlisted man ever to serve the United States Congress, if I'm not [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=187.66s)]
*  mistaken, who later worked on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=192.18s)]
*  I don't think that really helps Donald Trump, whose own former staffers say he called [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=195.06s)]
*  American war veterans suckers and losers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  Republicans are going to find out, I think, that framing a gun owning Midwest nice guy as a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=203.9s)]
*  radical far left commie ends up painting you into some really weird corners. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  Some conservatives now in order to sort of keep this whole shtick going now claiming Minnesota [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  just isn't real America. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=219.62s)]
*  No, literally, the secretary of the Ohio Republican Party said Minnesota isn't even in the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=221.54s)]
*  Midwest. It's basically Canada, which last I checked we have 50 states. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  Natural Review writer who said Canada, Minnesota is Canada light might as well be a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=231.46s)]
*  different planet. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  Remember how Republicans said the theme of their convention last month was unifying [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=238.06s)]
*  Americans? Now they're reduced to arguing the most genuine regular guy in a major party [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  American major American party ticket, the highest ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=245.58s)]
*  Congress, whose biggest political achievement is making sure no kids go hungry in schools, is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=249.94s)]
*  actually a gender hating, valor stealing, civilization destroying anarchist who kind of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=254.34s)]
*  looks like Chris Farley. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=259.18s)]
*  Doing it, they're sounding even more racist and transphobic, more unhinged and frankly, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=261.14s)]
*  weirder and weirder. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n4jmtwLSQ&t=267.98s)]
