# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0)
*  Tonight, I want to talk about something a little different because not enough people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=0.0s)]
*  are talking about why this is all happening in the first place. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=4.2s)]
*  And I mean like really, let's just go down to fundamentals. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=8.18s)]
*  We're watching the story. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=10.52s)]
*  Maybe you've seen it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=11.98s)]
*  What is this about? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=13.6s)]
*  Why are we having a debt ceiling showdown? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Why are Republicans threatening to tank the global economy and default for the first time [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=19.56s)]
*  in this country's history unless they get their way to impose austerity and cut federal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=23.2s)]
*  spending on those programs severely? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=29.22s)]
*  Now the stated justification for the hostage-taking, you heard it everywhere, doesn't make any [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=32.9s)]
*  sense. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=38.66s)]
*  And this is really the key to understanding this whole thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=39.66s)]
*  The sort of top-line answer, which again has been taken for granted as the answer in most [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=41.62s)]
*  mainstream coverage, is that Republicans want to cut spending. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=46.3s)]
*  And they want to cut spending because they have an ideological commitment to cutting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=50.68s)]
*  spending. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=54.22s)]
*  You see that everywhere. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=55.76s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy says it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=56.92s)]
*  The reporters, by and large, are reporting on him, tend to sort of go along with that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=58.24s)]
*  That's the fight. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=62.0s)]
*  It is simply not true. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=63.0s)]
*  It is maddening to see it repeated because it cannot possibly be the actual answer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=65.4s)]
*  And this isn't speculation or mind reading on my part. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=73.48s)]
*  These are just the facts, the history. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=76.4s)]
*  This is an empirical situation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=78.38s)]
*  We know that cannot be the answer because we have seen what the Republican Party does [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=80.28s)]
*  when it has control of the government and is free to pursue its agenda, when Republicans [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=86.4s)]
*  control both Houses of Congress and the presidency. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=90.56s)]
*  You were alive for this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=93.48s)]
*  I was too. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=94.6s)]
*  We were all here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=95.6s)]
*  We saw it all happen, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=96.6s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=98.2s)]
*  Well, they cut taxes for corporations and rich people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=99.2s)]
*  And they do that every time without fail, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's because the Republican Party really does believe in that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=105.82s)]
*  They really do believe in cutting taxes for corporations and rich people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=109.84s)]
*  They really do use their power to make it happen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=112.76s)]
*  It's the one piece of legislation they'll manage to get passed even when they're screwing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=114.88s)]
*  up left and right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Didn't George W. Bush, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Didn't John. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=122.36s)]
*  They push deregulation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=123.36s)]
*  They make life harder for undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=125.88s)]
*  They restricted illegal immigration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=128.92s)]
*  Sometimes they pick cultural fights. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=131.28s)]
*  They tend to boost spending for defense. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=133.8s)]
*  But one thing they do not do when they have unified control of the federal government [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=135.94s)]
*  is reduce spending. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=141.16s)]
*  Again, this is just a historical fact. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=143.6s)]
*  I'm not doing any mind reading. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=146.36s)]
*  I'm just telling you the simple fact of the matter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=147.72s)]
*  When they have control of the government, they do the opposite of reducing spending. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=150.88s)]
*  They increase spending when their party is in power, when they control the White House. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think because in the main, government spending is popular and tends to boost the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  political fortunes of the White House and the president. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=167.5s)]
*  In this case, a Republican president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=171.32s)]
*  It helps the Republican president get reelected. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=173.04s)]
*  Axios put together this handy chart of government spending. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=176.56s)]
*  The purple line is defense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=179.26s)]
*  The brown line is everything else. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=180.4s)]
*  You can see it there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=181.92s)]
*  Spending goes up during the administration of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=182.92s)]
*  And then it slows down a little bit. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=186.84s)]
*  See that little flat line during the Clinton years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=188.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=190.76s)]
*  Again, that's when Bill Clinton was the president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=191.76s)]
*  And then after the House got taken over by Newt Gingrich, right, Republicans had a big [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=193.78s)]
*  budget standoff and they imposed spending cuts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=198.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, then spending skyrockets under George W. Bush. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay, see? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  See how that line goes up? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=209.68s)]
*  Again, George W. Bush takes office. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=210.68s)]
*  He's got a House and Senate, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=212.28s)]
*  Republicans, they forced the country into two very pointless, very expensive wars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=214.8s)]
*  They also ran up a lot of domestic spending. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=218.62s)]
*  And then what happens after that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=221.36s)]
*  Oh, look, it drops again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=222.68s)]
*  Pretty dramatically under the Democratic president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=225.52s)]
*  And see the dip around 2011 there? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=228.36s)]
*  That's the last time that Republicans were in opposition and held the House and held [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=231.68s)]
*  the debt ceiling hostage. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  The exact same playbook as right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=237.44s)]
*  They demanded Democrats agreed to painful unpopular spending cuts or else Republicans [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=240.88s)]
*  would crater the economy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=245.24s)]
*  So again, Republicans in power, spent, spent, spent for decades while they had the presidency, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=247.84s)]
*  turned around and pretended to care about curbing spending once Democrats are in power. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=253.8s)]
*  Bill Clinton, certainly Barack Obama. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=257.04s)]
*  And again, why? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=258.88s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=260.8s)]
*  Why are they not consistent? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=261.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=262.8s)]
*  The answer is very simple and straightforward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=263.8s)]
*  They wanted to make it harder for Barack Obama to get reelected. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's Mitch McConnell just days after Republicans retook Congress in 2010. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=270.68s)]
*  Over the past week, some have said it was indelicate of me to suggest that our top political [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=277.0s)]
*  priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=283.72s)]
*  But the fact is, if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=290.72s)]
*  spending bill, to end the bailouts, cut spending, and shrink the size and scope of government, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=294.68s)]
*  the only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  veto any of these things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=304.92s)]
*  But they don't want to shrink the size and scope of government. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=306.56s)]
*  They just had control of the government under George O. U. Bush and they did not shrink [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=308.92s)]
*  its scope or its size. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  Again, you can't take what they're saying at face value because it makes no sense. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Obama was forced to strike a deal to get the debt ceiling raised, which pushed austerity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=320.92s)]
*  measures that appreciably slowed the recovery from the financial crisis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=324.2s)]
*  It made the economy worse. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=328.4s)]
*  It created unnecessary misery for millions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=329.78s)]
*  It also made it worse than it should have been when he was running for a second term [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=333.46s)]
*  in 2012. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  You can see it right here on this chart. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=340.02s)]
*  The top line is how much the government was projected to spend during the Obama years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  The bottom line is how much the government actually spent after the Tea Party forced [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=346.0s)]
*  Democrats to cut spending. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=350.23999999999995s)]
*  See how the bottom line, the amount the country has spent is way lower than what originally [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=351.23999999999995s)]
*  was projected before Republicans demanded cuts? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=355.2s)]
*  But then you'll see something else. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  See how it kind of bows up there, starts to go up? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=359.7s)]
*  It looks like the bottom line starts to tick up around. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=362.34s)]
*  Drum roll please. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  When could it be? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  Ah yes, 27. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  2017. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  Right after Donald Trump was elected and Republicans controlled Congress. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  They started spending, of course. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  Let's go back to the first chart for a second and look at government spending under Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=377.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, it skyrocketed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=381.1s)]
*  Look at the line shoot up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=383.82s)]
*  Non-military spending in particular went way up under Trump than Republicans. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=385.98s)]
*  In fact, Republicans spent so much, partnered with massive tax cuts to the rich and corporations, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=389.14s)]
*  the deficit increased nearly 40% under Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=395.1s)]
*  Now again, I'm belaboring this a little bit, but I just, I can't bear it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  I think at this point everyone sort of agrees Republicans don't actually care about the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=406.02s)]
*  federal deficit. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=409.14s)]
*  That was the old excuse and no one buys it anymore. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=410.14s)]
*  Clearly they don't. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=413.41999999999996s)]
*  You can't care about the deficit while you're also pushing massive tax cuts for the rich, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=414.41999999999996s)]
*  untenable. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=418.18s)]
*  But people still haven't really come around to the even more basic idea that Republicans, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=419.85999999999996s)]
*  they don't care about spending either the size and scope of government. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  But that's what the numbers say. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=429.38s)]
*  Again, this is just, I'm just reading you the history. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=431.29999999999995s)]
*  So then the question becomes, this is a little bit of a mystery. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=434.9s)]
*  Well, not really a big one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=437.26s)]
*  But the question is, if Republicans don't care about spending, which they don't, then [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  why are they forcing a crisis over the debt ceiling? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=442.29999999999995s)]
*  What's it really all about? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  And again, the answer is very simple. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  It is about asserting dominance over the Democratic president and hurting his political [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  fortunes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  I know that sounds cynical, but there is literally no other way to interpret the remarkably [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=457.06s)]
*  weak, consistent position Republicans take about these matters of spending. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=462.98s)]
*  President Biden himself acknowledged as much over the weekend. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  I think there are some mega Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=471.54s)]
*  do to the economy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  And because I am president and presidents responsible for everything, Biden would take [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=482.1s)]
*  the blame. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=486.54s)]
*  And that's the one way to make sure Biden's not reelected. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=487.54s)]
*  Look at this way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=491.26s)]
*  Republicans recognize high degrees of spending under a president tend to be politically popular. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=492.5s)]
*  In fact, Mitch McConnell admitted as much back in 2019. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=496.5s)]
*  Everyone else has forgotten this quote, but I have not. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=499.86s)]
*  This is tattooed in my brain because back in 2019, the Washington Post reported, quote, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=502.7s)]
*  Mitch McConnell told President Trump privately that no politician has ever lost an election [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=506.74s)]
*  for spending more money. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=510.94s)]
*  Inverse is also true. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=514.42s)]
*  Lowering the amount of government spending tends to hurt the economy, hurt American voters, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=516.46s)]
*  tends to be politically unpopular. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=520.0999999999999s)]
*  So again, the Republican calculus is simple. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=522.66s)]
*  You spend like there's no tomorrow when you're in power because it helps you politically. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=524.9799999999999s)]
*  When you're out of power, you do everything possible to stop Democrats from spending in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  order to hurt them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=531.64s)]
*  And it just so happens Republicans have some pretty great leverage in these negotiations [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  by again, threatening to blow up the world economy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  The current MAGA Republican Party is completely untethered from any unifying vision of the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  social contract, particularly on matters of political economy, where they're all over [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=547.22s)]
*  the place. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=550.26s)]
*  They don't really know even what they want. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=551.26s)]
*  So they're totally fine taking the economy hostage to get their way. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  They have the leverage because so many of them are political nihilists who don't really [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=556.94s)]
*  believe in anything except their own power. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  And there's a reason why you have this cliche. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=563.38s)]
*  You've heard it all the time, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=565.4200000000001s)]
*  Negotiating with terrorists. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=566.9s)]
*  And the reason people invoke that cliche is you're at inherent disadvantage negotiating [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=569.22s)]
*  with someone who is going to do something malevolent and destructive, completely unbound [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=572.98s)]
*  by any rules or norms. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=579.14s)]
*  But also if you give into that person and their demands, it then incentivizes them to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  act in the same way in the future. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  And this is why we're here. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama gave in largely to their demands in 2011. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=590.38s)]
*  And here we are more than a decade later in the exact same position. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=593.48s)]
*  Now, I would argue Republicans are even possibly more sociopathic about this stuff than they [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=595.94s)]
*  were during the Tea Party years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=603.2600000000001s)]
*  Like do you really think the Republican conference that voted for Donald Trump's coup is going [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=605.7s)]
*  to think twice before blowing up the economy or hurt Joe Biden? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  I frankly don't have a solution here. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=614.34s)]
*  President Biden says he won't sidestep the issue by invoking the constitutional requirement [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=616.1400000000001s)]
*  that the government pay its debts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  It's written right there in the 14th Amendment. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=622.36s)]
*  It says the debt shall not be questioned. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=624.22s)]
*  That seems pretty definitive to me. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=626.22s)]
*  And many of them have called to do that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=627.94s)]
*  And the Democrats get some blame here because they did not raise the debt ceiling during [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=631.32s)]
*  the lame duck session after last year's midterms, like many folks, including myself and Senator [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=635.14s)]
*  Bernie Sanders said they should do. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=639.9s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=642.02s)]
*  We're in this position chiefly because the Republican Party wants more than anything [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=643.02s)]
*  else in the world for Joe Biden to lose and a Republican, most likely the guy who tried [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=647.5400000000001s)]
*  to end American democracy to win in 2024. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=653.2600000000001s)]
*  But the least we the media can do is accurately describe what's actually happening. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=657.3000000000001s)]
*  And as if things could not get any worse for Trump legally, he's now facing new trouble [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=663.34s)]
*  for comments he made about writer E. Jean Carroll on national television just one day [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=668.3800000000001s)]
*  after being found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=672.98s)]
*  in damages. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=678.46s)]
*  Tonight, Miss Carroll is seeking in Manhattan federal court a quote very substantial additional [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=679.94s)]
*  amount of damages in response to Donald Trump's comments on CNN. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=684.7800000000001s)]
*  The filing says tonight that she should be awarded these damages to quote punish Trump [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=689.38s)]
*  to deter him from engaging in further defamation and to deter others from doing the same. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=693.74s)]
*  George Conway is a conservative attorney and former Republican. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=699.14s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  George, let me start on the E. Jean Carroll news. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=703.5s)]
*  I know you had talked to her at some point about the case. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  You were you were you were invoked in closing arguments as a sort of boogeyman that was [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=708.18s)]
*  behind the whole thing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=713.02s)]
*  It seemed eminently predictable that CNN was going to be hosting defamation when they had [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=715.06s)]
*  him on the day after this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  He then proceeded to say things about her that are very similar to what he said that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=722.3399999999999s)]
*  got him found guilty of defamation. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=727.42s)]
*  Do you think this is a strong case and what's it mean? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=731.6999999999999s)]
*  I think she has a strong case for adding those punitive damages claims to her prior complaint. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=734.5400000000001s)]
*  The complaint that there that she's amending this time was actually the original complaint [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=741.1s)]
*  from the first lawsuit suit that Jean brought in 2019 when President Trump as president [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=746.86s)]
*  from the bully pulpit of the Oval Office denied that anything ever happened at Bergdorf-Gordman [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=754.5400000000001s)]
*  and basically accused Jean of being a liar. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  And she got three million dollars for the second libel that occurred in 2022 when he [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=765.6600000000001s)]
*  was dumb enough to repeat the first libel. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=773.0600000000001s)]
*  And in this time he wasn't president. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=775.7800000000001s)]
*  So he didn't have this legal argument because that's why the first case went off off on [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=777.6600000000001s)]
*  a wild goose chase in the appellate courts. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=781.7s)]
*  But now it's come back. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=783.5s)]
*  He's now that case already had more damages potentially than the case that she already [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=785.42s)]
*  won than the three million she already won because he was president at the time. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=792.22s)]
*  It was the first the very, very first libel that he made on Jean Carroll. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=795.9s)]
*  And now the fact that he has repeated the libel after being found to have sexually abused [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=804.46s)]
*  her and libeled her is really, really outrageous and it's supportive of punitive damages. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=812.06s)]
*  This verdict could be greater than the five million dollars that she got in the first [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=820.38s)]
*  case. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=825.3399999999999s)]
*  And frankly I hope it is because I think at some point he's got to stop lying about this [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=826.3399999999999s)]
*  and stop stop libeling her. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=830.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, how many times are we going to have to go through this? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=833.26s)]
*  Well, this is interesting. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=836.18s)]
*  Trump's attorney's response is Ms. Carroll's 11th hour attempt to amend her complaint exposes [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=837.18s)]
*  the true motivation behind her numerous lawsuits. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=841.94s)]
*  And it's like, yes, the true motivation is to get him to stop defaming her. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=847.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=850.0600000000001s)]
*  So Fox News is trying to stop the bleeding in the wake of its seven hundred eighty seven [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=851.0600000000001s)]

*  of all time. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=861.34s)]
*  Their latest cost cutting move is apparently axing the network's entire investigative [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=862.46s)]
*  unit. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=867.9000000000001s)]
*  That's according to a report from Rolling Stone. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=868.9s)]
*  Sort of funny that Fox would fire its investigative journalists of all people after settling a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  lawsuit about how they spread misinformation and lies. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=876.3s)]
*  I personally don't think that group was really the source of their problems. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=879.26s)]
*  While the network makes changes behind the scenes, it appears to be business as usual [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=884.14s)]
*  on air and in print in the Murdoch Empire. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=887.66s)]
*  Let's take this front page story in the Murdoch-owned New York Post earlier this month. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=891.66s)]
*  You can see it right there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=896.14s)]
*  The press kicked out for migrants. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=897.94s)]
*  Outrage as upstate hotels tell 20 homeless veterans to leave. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=900.3800000000001s)]
*  The Post cited a nonprofit group, the Yeric Israel Tony Foundation, that said the veterans, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=904.9000000000001s)]
*  quote, including a 24 year old man in desperate need of help after serving in Afghanistan, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=910.3800000000001s)]
*  were told by the hotels that their temporary housing was getting pulled out from under [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=914.9000000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=918.5400000000001s)]
*  According to the Post, the hotels are not believed to have migrants yet, or reportedly [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=920.1s)]
*  on the city's shortlist to take some. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=924.5s)]
*  Now, the CEO of that nonprofit did admit that the hotels didn't explicitly say the vets [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=927.5s)]
*  had to move because of the migrants, but it was clear to her that was the case given the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=932.58s)]
*  timing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=936.38s)]
*  But this was far more than enough for Fox News. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=937.78s)]
*  They really ran with this story, featuring it on no less than 15 different shows over [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=940.86s)]
*  the past 10 days. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=946.5s)]
*  The network even claimed to have, crucially, substantiated the reporting themselves. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=947.98s)]
*  A group of veterans, some suffering from PTSD, may now be victims of New York's migrant busing [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=953.74s)]

*  Fox News confirms 20 homeless vets just got kicked out of several hotels in the suburbs [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=962.66s)]
*  north of Manhattan to make room for those migrants getting bused in from the city. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=968.4200000000001s)]
*  Remember that phrase, Fox News confirms. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=973.94s)]
*  Fox News confirms. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=977.22s)]
*  Republican lawmakers piled on with one New York State Assemblyman Brian Maher introducing [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=979.78s)]

*  Presidential contender Nikki Haley retweeted the New York Post article commenting, quote, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=989.98s)]
*  liberal insanity at work. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=994.78s)]

*  policies, calling the entire situation shameful. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1000.78s)]
*  Todd Young of Indiana even brought up the story on the Senate floor. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1003.9s)]
*  In New York City, where illegal migrants have displaced homeless veterans in hotels, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1009.26s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams said, quote, the president and the White House have failed this city. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1016.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1022.38s)]
*  Do you know where I'm going with this? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1023.38s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1026.78s)]
*  Well, the whole thing unraveled. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1028.14s)]
*  A local paper, God bless them, the Mid-Hudson News reported the story was a lie, according [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1030.54s)]
*  to the hotel that was accused of forcing the veterans out. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  The paper and the hotel debunked a purported receipt for the veterans rooms provided by [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1038.38s)]
*  Assemblyman Maher as a poorly edited fake. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1043.3400000000001s)]
*  The hotel manager said there were no veterans at the hotel. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1047.7800000000002s)]
*  None were kicked out and no other guests were told to vacate. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1050.74s)]
*  So you might think, okay, maybe they just invented the whole thing, but no, it gets [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1053.74s)]
*  better because the following day the paper reported that several homeless men, not veterans, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1056.5400000000002s)]
*  had come forward to say they had been recruited for this scam. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1061.22s)]
*  They were told they were going to meet with an elected official for discussion on homelessness [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1065.82s)]
*  and were each promised $200 along with food and alcohol. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1069.82s)]
*  After eating and drinking at a diner, the CEO of the nonprofit told them they were going [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1073.26s)]
*  to a meeting where she would be explaining how they had been kicked out of a hotel to [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1077.0s)]
*  make room for migrants and coach them to, and I quote here, to act like we were the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1080.82s)]
*  veterans that had been displaced. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1085.22s)]
*  The CEO admitted to the Mid-Hudson News that she provided the men from the shelter to appear [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1087.6599999999999s)]
*  as if they were displaced vets, but denies offering to pay them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1091.9s)]
*  According to three of the men who spoke to the Times Union, they never received that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1096.02s)]
*  money they were promised. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1098.8200000000002s)]
*  Quote, everything was a scam. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1099.94s)]
*  She didn't have the intention of paying us anything. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1101.5400000000002s)]
*  Assemblyman Maher says he was duped by the nonprofit as well. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1105.0600000000002s)]
*  And now, well, Fox News, having gone pretty all in on this story, has been forced to issue [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1107.9s)]
*  a rare correction, with that job falling to unlucky host Laura Ingraham on Friday night. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1114.5400000000002s)]
*  Before we go, a little update on a story we brought you this week about homeless vets [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1121.26s)]
*  being displaced from hotels so that illegals could move in. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1125.3400000000001s)]
*  Turns out the group behind the claim made it up. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1129.22s)]
*  We have no clue as to why anyone would do such a thing, but we'll bring you any updates [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1133.74s)]
*  should they come. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1138.54s)]
*  Oh, at the end of the show on a Friday night, you just got it in there. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1139.54s)]
*  Yeah, Laura, why would anyone want to make up a story that's too good to check but plays [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1143.22s)]
*  directly into the most deranged bias of your conservative audience? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1148.54s)]
*  I can't imagine Fox News airing those kinds of lies, but I guess there's a first time [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1151.98s)]
*  for everything. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh636eyIzU0&t=1156.6599999999999s)]
