# See Trump’s ‘blatant quid pro quo’ with Eric Adams play out live on Fox News
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are right now in the midst of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=0.0s)]
*  the biggest scandal of the Department of Justice since Watergate in the 1970s. So [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=4.16s)]
*  far seven prosecutors have quit the DOJ in protest of Trump's corrupt deal with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=8.46s)]
*  New York City's Democratic Mayor Eric Adams. In what can really best be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=14.58s)]
*  described as a blatant quid pro quo, the charges in Mayor Adams federal bribery [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=18.92s)]
*  case have been conditionally dropped for now in exchange for his full [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  cooperation with Trump's plans for immigration enforcement and mass [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=28.52s)]
*  deportation in New York City. Now yesterday six career prosecutors, people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=32.28s)]
*  who signed up to work for Donald Trump resigned rather than help facilitate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=37.96s)]
*  such obvious corruption by dropping the charges. This morning a seventh DOJ [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  official, a man named Hagen Scotton, the lead prosecutor on the case, joined them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=47.6s)]
*  In a letter to Trump's acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bovi, Scotton called [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=52.28s)]
*  the deal with Mayor Adams a serious mistake and he insisted that no system [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=57.8s)]
*  of ordered liberty can allow the government to use the carrot of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=62.4s)]
*  dismissing charges or the stick of threatening to bring them again to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=66.08s)]
*  induce an elected official to support its policy objectives, adding that any [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=69.64s)]
*  assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=75.08s)]
*  using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=79.88s)]
*  elected officials in this way. If no lawyer within earshot of the president [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=84.64s)]
*  is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  someone who is enough of a fool or enough of a coward to follow your [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=94.08s)]
*  motion. But it was never going to be me. The formal filing to drop those [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=98.32s)]
*  charges was finally submitted about an hour ago, following an intense pressure [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=104.36s)]
*  campaign by the man you see there, Emil Bovi, to find lawyers at the DOJ's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=108.88s)]
*  Public Integrity Office, that's the folks that prosecute public corruption, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=113.6s)]
*  that would be willing to sign the requisite motion. Now he finally [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=117.72s)]
*  convinced a trial lawyer near retirement, as well as a supervisor at [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=121.24s)]
*  the criminal division to agree. But here's the thing, a judge still needs [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  to sign off on the whole thing. Now, we should say Mayor Eric Adams denies [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=129.2s)]
*  the charges against him, insists his deal with DOJ was totally above board. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=133.6s)]
*  In a statement today, he did not explicitly deny a quid pro quo, but he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=137.6s)]
*  did deny any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=141.0s)]
*  But even that denial is difficult to square with the language that Bovi [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=147.24s)]
*  himself used in his initial letter demanding the Southern District of New [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=150.36s)]
*  York drop the pending charges against Mayor Adams, so that he can, quote, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=154.68s)]
*  devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration that escalated [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=158.88s)]
*  under the policies of the prior administration. Now, Bovi obviously [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=163.68s)]
*  understands how that could sound like, well, a quid pro quo, which is why he [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=167.88s)]
*  went out of his way to add a very funny footnote, preemptively insisting, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=172.12s)]
*  it is not one. Citing an earlier memo from SDNY, as Mr. Bovi clearly stated [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  to defense counsel during our government, the government is not offering [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=181.44s)]
*  to exchange dismissal of a criminal case for Adams' assistance on immigration [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=185.88s)]
*  enforcement. Perish the thought, where'd you get that idea? Except federal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  prosecutors literally asked the judge to dismiss the case against Mayor Adams. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=195.56s)]
*  Everyone can see what's going on here. Of course, this all started earlier [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=200.8s)]
*  this week when Danielle says soon she was Trump's pick to serve as the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=205.12s)]
*  acting U.S. Attorney for SDNY. She's a prosecutor with sterling credentials [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=208.44s)]
*  among conservatives, clerked for Scalia. She, in response to being ordered [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=212.36s)]
*  to drop the case, sent a letter offering her resignation directly to the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=217.2s)]
*  Attorney General, Pam Bondi, right, bypassing Bovi, who had sent her this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=220.6s)]
*  instruction, writing that Adams' attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=223.48s)]
*  to a quid pro quo, indicating Adams would be in a position to assist with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=228.04s)]
*  the department's enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  adding, rather than be rewarded, Adams' advocacy should be called out for what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  it is, an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=241.72s)]
*  for a dismissal of his case. In that same letter, Sassoon outlines a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=246.56s)]
*  particularly damning anecdote in which Bovi admonished a member of my team who [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=251.08s)]
*  took notes during that meeting with Adams' lawyers and directed the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=257.12s)]
*  collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion. Like, why are you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=260.64s)]
*  writing things down, lawyer, from the Justice Department? Probably worth [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=265.44s)]
*  stressing here, it's standard practice for prosecutors to take notes in a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=270.24s)]
*  meeting like this, and that demanding them refrain from doing so and then [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  confiscating their notes is not a sign that everything you're doing is on the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=276.6s)]
*  up and up. Bovi responded to Sassoon's letter with a blustery eight-page [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=280.36s)]
*  letter of his own yesterday where he admonished her for refusing to drop the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  charges, accused her of participating in a partisan witch hunt against an [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  elected Democrat? Bovi also mentioned by name two assistant U.S. attorneys under [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=293.72s)]
*  Sassoon, who worked on the case, and basically directed them to contact his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=299.36s)]
*  office if they were willing to drop the charges, and it was one of those [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=303.92s)]
*  attorneys that he name checked, Hagen Scotton, the guy I quoted a moment ago, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=307.12s)]
*  who resigned today and told Bovi to go kick rocks. There's one more back and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=311.32s)]
*  forth in letters between Sassoon and Bovi I think is worth highlighting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=317.16s)]
*  because it sort of gets to the nut of the point, a perfect encapsulation of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=320.68s)]
*  just how corrupt, how rotten this deal is that Trump is offering Mayor Adams. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Sassoon in her letter invokes the case of Michael Flynn, that was Trump's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=330.12s)]
*  former national security advisor in his last administration, and in short, Flynn [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=332.68s)]
*  was indicted for lying to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to the charges. Then [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=336.0s)]
*  Trump's DOJ under Attorney General Bill Barr demanded the charges be dropped [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=339.32s)]
*  anyway after he pleaded guilty. Now, the judge overseeing the case refused to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=343.56s)]
*  dismiss it, but the whole thing eventually went away when Trump stepped [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=347.6s)]
*  in and simply pardoned Flynn on his way out of office. In her letter to Bovi, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=350.92s)]
*  Sassoon points out that the president could just do the same thing now, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=356.16s)]
*  noting that with Flynn, the president ultimately chose to cut off the extended [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=359.68s)]
*  and embarrassing litigation over dismissal by granting a pardon. Bovi [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  responded to that with some more bluster, basically admonishing Sassoon for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=369.04s)]
*  daring to question Trump's authority. Don't tell the president who to pardon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=372.8s)]
*  But let's linger here for a second because that example raises an important [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=377.56s)]
*  point, right? All this is happening because Trump did not pardon Adams. In [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=380.76s)]
*  fact, we have reporting in the New York Times that Adams explicitly sent a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=386.64s)]
*  letter asking for a pardon. He didn't get one. That kind of gives the game [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  away, doesn't it? Because it's not as though this president is particularly [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=393.6s)]
*  shy about wielding his pardon power, considering that on day one he parted [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=397.8s)]
*  1600 January six riders, including a bunch of folks who have since been [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  rearrested for the crimes. Others who committed violence. He pardoned the guy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=406.04s)]
*  that was running like the biggest drug trafficking website in the world. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=408.72s)]
*  Pardoned him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=411.94s)]
*  Trump intentionally did not just pardon the mayor, which would be fully within [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=414.36s)]
*  his rights. Instead, what he chose to do was to dangle freedom in front of him [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=418.22s)]
*  in exchange for his preferred policy outcomes in New York City. The [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=423.72s)]
*  conditional dropping of the charges on a possibly temporary basis was the quid, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  right? Well, today, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  as all of this is developing in the shadow of this scandal, today we got the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=436.0s)]
*  quo. We got the quo when Mayor Adams went on a media tour along with Trump's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  so called borders are where he was forced to insist he is a willing [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=445.0s)]
*  participant in Trump's immigration crackdown and denied the existence of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=448.72s)]
*  any sort of shady dealings. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=452.32s)]
*  Think about my attorney Alex Spira, one of the one of the top, uh, trial [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=455.41999999999996s)]
*  attorneys in the country. Imagine him going inside saying that the only way [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  Mayor Adams is going to assist in immigration, which I was calling for [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=467.67999999999995s)]
*  for since 2022 is if you drop the charges. That's quit per call. That's a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  crime. It took her three weeks to report in front of her a criminal [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  action. Come on, this is silly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=482.12s)]
*  Now, that denial again was a little undercut during that very same [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=484.86s)]
*  interview when Trump's border guy sitting next to him on the curvy couch [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  issued a not so veiled threat against Adams if he doesn't do what the big [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=492.24s)]
*  boss wants. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=495.92s)]
*  I came to New York City. I wasn't gonna leave out nothing. I did the last time [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=498.04s)]
*  and I told him I'm not leaving until I got something and now I got him on the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=501.64s)]
*  couch in front of millions of people. He can back waving this now, right? If [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=505.14s)]
*  he doesn't come through, I'll be back in New York City and we won't be sitting [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=508.12s)]
*  on the couch. I'll be in his office up his up his butt saying, Where the hell [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=511.68s)]
*  is the agreement we came to? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=515.72s)]
*  It's kind of like a buddy comedy, right? Everyone's laughing. We're gonna [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=518.32s)]
*  deport a lot of people in New York City. You're gonna get your charges [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=521.6s)]
*  dropped. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=524.08s)]
*  It's pretty despicable. Actually, it's one of the most corrupt dealings I've [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=525.92s)]
*  ever seen. Certainly, I think in the history of the modern Justice [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=529.32s)]
*  Department and is playing out for all of us to see on morning television. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=531.64s)]
*  Andrew Weissman spent years serving the Department of Justice, including as [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=536.32s)]
*  the lead prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller's office. Paul Butler [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=539.18s)]
*  is a former federal prosecutor prosecutor who served in the public [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  integrity unit of DOJ, which saw a number of staffers resign in protest [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  this week. They join me now. Paul, let me start with you just a little bit [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=549.66s)]
*  of the D. O. A. Of the sorry the D. N. A. Of that public integrity unit [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=552.38s)]
*  in main justice where you served. I mean, this is a place that they exist [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  to prosecute public corruption. We know yesterday a number of the deputies [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=562.14s)]
*  resigned rather than sign this order, and it looks like today a bunch of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=566.26s)]
*  them refused to go along with it as well. Tell us about what is what is [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=569.86s)]
*  the sort of makeup of that unit? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=574.26s)]
*  So Chris, when I served in the public integrity section, I was part of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=577.18s)]
*  a team that prosecuted a Republican senator for corruption. We started [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=580.62s)]
*  that investigation in a Democratic administration, and it continued under [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=585.66s)]

*  the law and the evidence. Contrast that with this justice department, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  where in the order to dismiss the case against Adams, the deputy attorney [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=605.3000000000001s)]

*  the evidence in the case. It's all about politics. So it's probably legal [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=613.46s)]
*  that the attorney general can threaten to fire lying attorneys who don't go [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=619.86s)]
*  along with her will, but it's unethical. It violates the Justice Department [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=625.1s)]
*  manual, and it's expressive. It sends this message to every government [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=630.2600000000001s)]
*  employee that if they better go along to get along. If they cross Trump, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=635.82s)]
*  not only do they risk losing their jobs, Chris, they risk being prosecuted [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=642.62s)]
*  themselves in Trump's newly weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAuKiYxh11Q&t=647.66s)]
