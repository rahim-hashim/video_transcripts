# Release of 'Epstein Files' sparks MAGA anger and disappointment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM)
*  Donald Trump and take it with a grain of salt has promised full transparency when it comes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=0.0s)]
*  to most of the big conspiracy theories of the past 60 years, something he campaigned [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=5.2s)]
*  on in the lead up to the election. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=9.0s)]
*  The issue led to an absolutely hall of fame interview clip. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=16.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=18.52s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=19.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=23.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=25.52s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=26.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=27.52s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=28.52s)]
*  Less so because, you know, you don't know. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because it's a lot [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=32.08s)]
*  of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=35.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=37.04s)]
*  I don't know about Epstein so much as I do the others. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=38.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=41.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=42.12s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=43.12s)]
*  Sure about that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=44.12s)]
*  Maybe not Epstein. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I wonder why Donald Trump wouldn't want the Epstein files being paid public. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, here he is in 1992 dancing and leering at women with his buddy Jeffrey Epstein at [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=54.8s)]
*  In 2002, Donald Trump said Jeffrey Epstein is, and I quote him here, a terrific guy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  It is even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=60.76s)]
*  younger side. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=65.64s)]
*  I wonder why Donald Trump wouldn't want the Epstein files being made public. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=67.52s)]
*  Thing is, many members of Trump's base do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=71.72s)]
*  The Republican House Oversight Committee sent multiple letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=74.96s)]
*  demanding the Epstein files be released. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=78.72s)]
*  Bondi then went on an apology tour to Fox News promising the documents would be released [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  imminently. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  Today, the White House made a big show of handing a bunch of conservative influencers [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  binders labeled the Epstein files. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=92.48s)]
*  Phase one. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=95.28s)]
*  But the whole stunt was a bust. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=96.84s)]
*  What's interesting is we're all waiting for bombshells, we're all waiting for juicy stuff, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=99.84s)]
*  and that's not what's in this binder. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=103.04s)]
*  That's not what's in this binder at all. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=105.2s)]
*  It is the biggest disappointment I think that you'll find. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=106.88s)]
*  I encourage you to do your own homework on this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=109.28s)]
*  We have, it's mostly procedural jargon, Glenn. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=111.0s)]
*  Heavily, heavily redacted. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=114.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Anna Polina Luna, the Florida Republican leading this charge, said of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=117.52s)]
*  binders, all caps, this is not what we or the American people asked for and a complete [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=121.0s)]
*  disappointment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=125.52s)]
*  And the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee made a post claiming to link to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=126.52s)]
*  the Epstein files that actually directed folks to the music video for Rick Astley's Never [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=130.08s)]
*  Gonna Give You Up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=134.8s)]
*  Sarah Fitzpatrick is a senior investigative producer for NBC News who's been covering [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=137.24s)]
*  this story and she joins me now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=140.72s)]
*  Sarah, first, I mean, what are the files? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=143.12s)]
*  My understanding is there's a lot that's already public and this was basically stuff already [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=146.68s)]
*  in the public domain? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=150.56s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=151.56s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, Chris. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=152.56s)]
*  Essentially, almost all of this, we believe, was already in the public domain. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=154.08s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the exhibits that they linked to in the press release, it says [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=157.44s)]
*  that these were trial exhibits at Epstein's alleged co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=162.88s)]
*  trial. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  So most of this information was shown to a jury in some form and our colleagues sat in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  the courtroom, as did many members of the American public, and have already seen this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=174.0s)]
*  information. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=177.56s)]
*  Some of it is heavily redacted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=178.92s)]
*  For example, there's something that they identify as a contact list, which has been known as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=180.68s)]
*  the black book of contacts that Epstein had. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=185.76s)]
*  This is information that not only was already out there, but doesn't shed any new light [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=189.88s)]
*  on anything that moves the story forward. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=197.12s)]
*  And honestly, I think my colleagues who are at the Justice Department today kind of described [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=199.72s)]
*  it as a very surreal, haphazard release, almost like a theatrical stunt. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=203.66s)]
*  And I think that was in part the point. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=210.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess there's a substantive question here, which is this has become a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=212.12s)]
*  kind of MacGuffin, a sort of plot device for a certain part of the conspiratorial right, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=217.32s)]
*  that there is some bombshell list of names that they, whoever they is, don't want you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=221.2s)]
*  to know, that will expose the, you know, pedo sex trafficking globalist or whoever you, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=225.76s)]
*  whatever your bad guy of choice is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=233.72s)]
*  It's not clear to me that anything like that exists, like there's a thing being hidden [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=236.12s)]
*  that's not being released. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=240.96s)]
*  Chris, I've been on this story for over seven years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=242.48s)]
*  I've interviewed, at this point, I think, over 100 people, at every who are involved [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=246.0s)]
*  in this investigation, who worked for Jeffrey Epstein, who were close to Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=250.36s)]
*  And what I can tell you is that I think that this story in some ways has taken on a life [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=254.32s)]
*  of its own. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=259.0s)]
*  This has been thoroughly litigated in courts, in civil litigation, in private settlement [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=260.0s)]
*  discussions. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=266.0s)]
*  And yes, there is a huge volume of information that has not been released to the public. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=267.0s)]
*  For example, the 302s of when the FBI interviewed victims, those are generally not released [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=272.12s)]
*  to the public. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  And so there is information that is out there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  But whether or not, as you say, it contains these bombshells, you know, you have to remember [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=281.12s)]
*  that under many, many different presidencies, jurisdictions, we've had this Southern District [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=285.16s)]
*  of New York who had multiple ongoing investigations, even after Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=292.0s)]
*  trials, into alleged co-conspirators, into Prince Andrew, into other people that were [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=298.76s)]
*  around him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=304.4s)]
*  And those ultimately did not come to trial. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=305.4s)]
*  So I think, yes, there is this view. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=307.56s)]
*  And I think it's also really important, you know, today, why was it today? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=310.32s)]
*  This information is, in some cases, decades old. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  The DOJ has had access to this information for a very long time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=318.64s)]
*  And no one today that I talked to could give me a clear reason about why this happened [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=323.44s)]
*  today, with the exception of one very senior Department of Justice official who said that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=328.88s)]
*  they perceived the purpose and the timing of this as a distraction from other matters. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=334.04s)]
*  And I think that is a very, very telling statement. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=340.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=342.52s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=343.52s)]
*  We don't know what those other matters are, though, do we? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=344.52s)]
*  We don't know precisely. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=345.78s)]
*  But I think, as you know, as you've reported on your show, there are so many things happening [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=346.94s)]
*  across the Justice Department at every level that are extremely concerning to the staff [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=350.76s)]
*  there, as well as outside observers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=355.44s)]
*  And so I think this effort, I think, is an indication of an effort to not have us answering [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=358.68s)]
*  those substantive questions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=365.4s)]
*  I should note that one of the lawyers for one of the victims, Spencer Kuvin, says, I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=366.4s)]
*  don't think there's anything new out there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=370.68s)]
*  This is a news story. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=372.24s)]
*  It's a publicity stunt. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=373.24s)]
*  He's worked on the case since 2005, representing nine victims, including victim number one. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=374.24s)]
*  The only reason I can think of them for to do this is really certain names that will [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=378.12s)]
*  embarrass the Democrats. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=380.92s)]
*  Kuvin said, of course, there were all kinds of names. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=381.92s)]
*  They're the same names that we've seen multiple times. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=384.2s)]
*  Sarah Fitzpatrick, excellent reporting. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=386.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for downloading that for us. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  Always. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_HVL8WIRcM&t=391.12s)]
