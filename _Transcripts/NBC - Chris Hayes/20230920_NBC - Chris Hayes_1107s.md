# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=0.0s)]
*  The extent to which the Republican Party has been consumed by bizarre, deranged, and dangerous conspiracy theories [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=2.0s)]
*  will likely end up as one of the defining political issues of our time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=9.0s)]
*  In fact, to a certain degree, democracy and the fate of the planet all depend on how we deal with it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=13.0s)]
*  Here's a small but perfect example. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=19.0s)]
*  Last night, we had that man, Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, on this program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=21.0s)]
*  The guy has really been through the wringer over the past 18 months. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=26.0s)]
*  He quite famously suffered a stroke midway through his campaign for Senate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=29.0s)]
*  And then he got back on the trail before he even had time to fully recover his speech faculties. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=33.0s)]
*  Fetterman won that race decisively anyway, much to the surprise of a lot of observers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=38.0s)]
*  And since ascending the Senate, he's become the subject of this truly stupid, insidious, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=43.0s)]
*  honestly pretty funny conspiracy theory that he has been replaced by an identical body double. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=49.0s)]
*  One post from one of Elon Musk's favorite accounts implied that it had to be a body double on our program last night [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=56.0s)]
*  because, get this, the Senator's speech processing has improved greatly since the early days of his stroke. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=63.0s)]
*  Real geniuses working over there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=70.0s)]
*  A popular meme used selectively cropped images to make it look like the Senator's tattoos were missing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=73.0s)]
*  in a viral clip of him reacting sarcastically to the news of a Republican impeachment inquiry into President Biden, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=78.0s)]
*  which raises a number of questions, one of which is why would anybody go to the trouble of hiring a Fetterman look-alike, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=84.0s)]
*  hard enough as it is, and then forget to add his very prominent tattoos? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=90.0s)]
*  And how many 6'8", 300 pound bald dudes with mustaches are there just hanging around anyway? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=95.0s)]
*  How do you run that casting call? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=102.0s)]
*  Now, the Senator has taken this ridiculous conspiracy in stride. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=104.0s)]
*  Last month he posted this video to social media. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=108.0s)]
*  During my time during the hospital, the fringy fringies really came up with a conspiracy that I have a body double. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=111.0s)]
*  And I just want you to know that is just crazy. That's not true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=119.0s)]
*  And I mean, dude, John, what event am I supposed to be doing this afternoon? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=123.0s)]
*  Dude, really. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=128.0s)]
*  Just the two of us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=129.0s)]
*  Okay, so on the one hand all this is pretty funny. We had some of it with it today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=132.0s)]
*  But what it says about the state of American political discourse is serious. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=136.0s)]
*  As Mark Bankston, an attorney representing families of victims in the Sandy Hook massacre, knows, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=141.0s)]
*  quote, my clients have dealt with this nonsense every single day for over 10 years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=148.0s)]
*  A collection of deranged Infowars fans harassed my client Lenny Posner every day, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=154.0s)]
*  claiming that his changed appearance in a court video last year proves he's actually a different man than the press pictures on the day of the tragedy 10 years ago. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=160.0s)]
*  They bombard him and everyone he knows with emails attaching bizarre facial comparisons of different pictures, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=168.0s)]
*  and they won't be convinced otherwise. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=175.0s)]
*  That's decidedly less funny. Enraging, actually. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=178.0s)]
*  That completely paranoid, preposterous conspiratorial thinking, again, is not the fringes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=182.0s)]
*  It is the dominant mode of collective reasoning of one of our two major political coalitions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=188.0s)]
*  We've only got two. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=196.0s)]
*  One of them is dominated by this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=198.0s)]
*  It dominates half the country's experience of reality, more or less. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=199.0s)]
*  It was on full display in the case of Ray Epps, the former Oath Keeper and January 6th rioter, the center of another ludicrous conspiracy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=204.0s)]
*  As that theory goes, Epps, who was at the grounds of the Capitol on January 6th and who talked about storming the building the night before, was actually a plant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=212.0s)]
*  He was working with the FBI to incite the riot as a false flag. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=220.0s)]
*  He was there to make Trump and his supporters look bad by convincing them to go into the Capitol, which no one else wanted to do, obviously, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=224.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this is, again, like the Federman body double, preposterous on its face, obviously false theory. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=232.0s)]
*  But again, this is not just randos on Twitter posting screenshots. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=239.0s)]
*  This was not relegated to the fringes of social media. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=244.0s)]
*  It was being pushed by prominent cable news hosts and members of Congress. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=247.0s)]
*  Ray Epps is one of the only people caught on camera that day encouraging others to break the law. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=252.0s)]
*  He's one of the only ones. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=259.0s)]
*  The question is, did Ray Epps work or have any contact with any government agency? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=261.0s)]
*  Did he talk about January 6th before it happened with any employee of the U.S. government? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=266.0s)]
*  On the 6th, it's not the Proud Boys who engage in the initial breach. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=272.0s)]
*  It's Ray Epps. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=277.0s)]
*  On the night of January 5th, 2021, Epps wandered around the crowd that had gathered. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=278.0s)]
*  And there's video out there of him chanting, tomorrow we need to get into the Capitol, into the Capitol. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=284.0s)]
*  This was strange behavior. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=291.0s)]
*  A lot of Americans are concerned that the federal government deliberately encouraged illegal and violent conduct on January 6th. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=293.0s)]
*  Again, I mean, think of what you just saw. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=303.0s)]
*  This is like Ted Cruz getting up there with big placards that his staff made up and they went to wherever to print her with like, here's John Fetterman yesterday. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=305.0s)]
*  Here's him the day before. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=311.0s)]
*  These are the same guy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=312.0s)]
*  Like it's that level. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=313.0s)]
*  As Ray Epps put it himself, the former Fox News host and his buddies in Congress tried to scapegoat him for their role in the big lie of a stolen election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=315.0s)]
*  He's obsessed with me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=325.0s)]
*  He's going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=327.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=333.0s)]
*  To shift blame on somebody else. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=334.0s)]
*  If you look at it, Fox News, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ted Cruz, Gates, they're all telling us before this thing that it was stolen. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=337.0s)]
*  So you tell me who has more impact on people, them or me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=347.0s)]
*  Now, Ray Epps is actually suing Fox News for defamation over the conspiracy theory. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=353.0s)]
*  Fox denies that it defamed Epps. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=360.0s)]
*  It did not immediately respond to a request for comment to NBC News. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=362.0s)]
*  I should say the network just requested oral argument in its motion to dismiss the suit yesterday. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=366.0s)]
*  We'll see where that goes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=371.0s)]
*  I don't, you know, I don't have a say on it legally. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=372.0s)]
*  Here's the kicker. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=375.0s)]
*  The key to this ridiculous 9-11 was an inside job level conspiracy always hinged on the fact that Ray Epps was not charged with the crime despite being caught on camera during the riot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=377.0s)]
*  Today, Ray Epps was charged for what prosecutors say was his role on January 6. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=388.0s)]
*  He is expected to plead guilty. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=393.0s)]
*  I think he's got a hearing tomorrow. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=395.0s)]
*  Will that put an end to it? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=398.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=399.0s)]
*  Of course it won't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=400.0s)]
*  Of course it won't. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=401.0s)]
*  It won't put any of this to rest. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=403.0s)]
*  The conspiracy universe doesn't deal in reality and it doesn't deal with like some new set of facts. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=405.0s)]
*  So even though this idea that Epps is a Fed has been disproven again and again and again, the lie will live on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=411.0s)]
*  And Ray Epps is going to have to live with it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=416.0s)]
*  It's just like some segment of Trump supporters will always believe that the Chinese government, with the help of some Italian satellites and possibly the ghost of Hugo Chavez, managed to hack a bunch of machines to rig tens of thousands of votes in multiple states for President Joe Biden to win the election. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=420.0s)]
*  And of course, again, it all ties back to that guy, right, Donald Trump? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=437.0s)]
*  Remember, how does he first make a splash in Republican politics that launches his political career? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=441.0s)]
*  By spreading, again, equally ridiculous John Fetterman body double level conspiracies about Barack Obama. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=447.0s)]
*  Recently you spent a lot of time talking about President Obama's birth certificate or lack thereof. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=455.0s)]
*  You don't seem convinced that he has one. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=461.0s)]
*  No, I'm not convinced that he has one. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=463.0s)]
*  Three weeks ago when I started, I thought he was probably born in this country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=465.0s)]
*  And now I really have a much bigger doubt than I did before. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=468.0s)]
*  But based on what? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=471.0s)]
*  His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=472.0s)]
*  Okay, he doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=477.0s)]
*  Now, that was always an obvious, transparent and racist lie. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=482.0s)]
*  Again, it was interesting. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=486.0s)]
*  It got attention. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=489.0s)]
*  It spoke to the biases certain people had already, and it made them feel better about themselves because of it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=490.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump is good at that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=496.0s)]
*  And he brought that kind of conspiratorial thinking to the mainstream. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=498.0s)]
*  It is a core, if not the core, tenet of his political philosophy of Trumpism writ large, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=502.0s)]
*  The world is rigged. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=508.0s)]
*  There's all these nefarious characters and Donald Trump sees through the matrix. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=509.0s)]
*  When one half of the country, again, not every individual, but like there are two political coalitions. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=513.0s)]
*  One of them is under the yoke of this way of thinking egged on by their leaders in Washington, the media. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=519.0s)]
*  It truly becomes hard to run a functioning democracy, which, of course, I suspect is precisely the reason Donald Trump pushes it in the first place. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=528.0s)]
*  Brian Stelzer is a media reporter and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=538.0s)]
*  He wrote about the story of Ray Epps in his new book titled Network of Lies, the epic saga of Fox News, Donald Trump, the battle for American democracy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=541.0s)]
*  That will be out in November. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=548.0s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=549.0s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=550.0s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=551.0s)]
*  Well, Epps, I mean, again, it was never about the actual facts here. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=552.0s)]
*  But give people a little context. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=556.0s)]
*  I mean, the Epps thing was wild. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=558.0s)]
*  Like they went to town on this one guy and it wasn't just fringe folks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=560.0s)]
*  This became a almost canonical story told about January 6th that this one guy's who incited the whole thing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=565.0s)]
*  Yes, largely Tucker Carlson, but also others on Fox and others in the house in the in the GOP media, you know, Maelstrom, including House lawmakers, as you showed there with Matt Gaetz and others pushing this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=571.0s)]
*  It comes from this premise that Tucker Carlson promoted on the night of the riot. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=582.0s)]
*  He said, this is not your fault. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=585.0s)]
*  Talking to his viewers, this is their fault. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=587.0s)]
*  He had to come up with a they had to figure out who to blame in order to maintain innocence for his fans. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=589.0s)]
*  He had to point in a different direction. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=595.0s)]
*  He had to come up with a set up conspiracy theory. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=597.0s)]
*  And in order to have a set up, you have to have set it up. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=599.0s)]
*  So he points to Ray Epps. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=601.0s)]
*  There were videos he points to, distorted videos to say, well, Ray Epps is part of the set up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=603.0s)]
*  He's an undercover agent. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=607.0s)]
*  He's one of the feds. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=608.0s)]
*  And because there were not charges pressed immediately against Epps, this theory continued to gain so much more attention for weeks and years and months and actually years. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=609.0s)]
*  He is suing now. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=617.0s)]
*  And, you know, we'll see what happens in the lawsuit. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=619.0s)]
*  That key there, the origin of this, which I think is a key thing to understand. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=622.0s)]
*  Reverse engineering around what needs to be the case to fill the audience demand. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=627.0s)]
*  Yes, to say this is not your fault. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=632.0s)]
*  Right. Because people watch, I think most people, and I think probably most Fox News, I think most Americans watch what happened in January 6 and were horrified by it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=634.0s)]
*  They weren't like, hey, that's great. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=640.0s)]
*  I think most people were like, this is awful. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=643.0s)]
*  So what you have to do is tell them a story about why it wasn't awful in the ways that you might think. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=644.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=650.0s)]
*  And that's why Ashley Babbitt becomes a martyr. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=651.0s)]
*  And that's why Donald Trump meets with a family. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=653.0s)]
*  That's why Ray Epps becomes a villain. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=655.0s)]
*  And what's so interesting about Epps is that he was actually a victim of Fox. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=657.0s)]
*  What I mean by that is he says in his lawsuit against Fox, he was a loyalist. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=661.0s)]
*  He believed Parker Carlson. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=665.0s)]
*  He was a Fox viewer. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=666.0s)]
*  Like a diehard. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=667.0s)]
*  And he trusted what they were saying so much so that he bought a plane ticket to Washington and he flew across the country to Washington. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=668.0s)]
*  So he trusted what Fox was saying. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=674.0s)]
*  And he's not the only one. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=675.0s)]
*  There have been other January 6 rioters who have pled guilty, as we expect Epps to do tomorrow, who have said, I trusted Fox until they lied about me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=676.0s)]
*  I think that's such an interesting dynamic to see over and over again. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=685.0s)]
*  And maybe that's one of the only dynamics that can pull people out of conspiracy thinking. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah, until they lied about me. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=692.0s)]
*  It's also the case that the sort of motivated reasoning is, again, I want to be clear here. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=695.0s)]
*  Like there was a whole like Melania Trump body double thing that went around the Internet. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=699.0s)]
*  Oh, gosh, I remember. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=704.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=705.0s)]
*  And to me, the key is like it's not that people's desire for this kind of thinking isn't partisan in any way. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=706.0s)]
*  Like people have this desire, motivated reasoning, conspiracy thinking. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=712.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=716.0s)]
*  The difference is what the leadership does and what the people with platforms do. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=717.0s)]
*  And it's like, did I go on the show and say, like, well, check out the Melania body double? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=721.0s)]
*  No, absolutely ridiculous. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=726.0s)]
*  There's standards and there's values. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=727.0s)]
*  And then there's consequences when those standards are falling, falling down. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=729.0s)]
*  You know, there is, I will tell you, at least a little bit of embarrassment at Fox about what Carlson was pushing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=733.0s)]
*  In fact, the documentary he did, which this conspiracy theory was at the center of it, actually led to a bunch of contributors to leave. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=738.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=744.0s)]
*  They were like, this is too much. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=745.0s)]
*  They couldn't take it anymore. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=746.0s)]
*  So there is a kind of, you know, that was called patriot purge. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=747.0s)]
*  There's been some purging that's happened. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=750.0s)]
*  People have purged themselves from that universe because they are embarrassed. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=751.0s)]
*  But clearly not enough. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=755.0s)]
*  So the problem with conspiracy theories, whether it's this or Fetterman, is that they're self-sealing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=756.0s)]
*  And every bit of evidence against them helps to confirm the conspiracy theory. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=760.0s)]
*  What do we do in that environment? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=764.0s)]
*  Well, I think what you just did, we ridicule, we make fun of it because look, until SNL is back, this is the best comedy show at 30 Rock. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=765.0s)]
*  Laughing at the Fetterman body double stuff is actually one appropriate technique, I think. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=772.0s)]
*  I want to just note something, too, because this does go back a long way. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=777.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously Richard Hofstadter writes the, you know, paranoid style in the mid-20th century. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=781.0s)]
*  But here's, I mean, here's a headline from 1995. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=786.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, this is Newt Gingrich. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=788.0s)]
*  Gingrich not convinced Foster death was suicide. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=790.0s)]
*  I mean, you had a prominent member, I think it was, I forget which House committee it was. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=793.0s)]
*  I think it was a guy named Dan Burton, if I'm not mistaken, who was like shooting a pumpkin in his backyard to recreate the Vince Foster. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=798.0s)]
*  So there is, there has been this strain among the Republican Party for a very long time. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=804.0s)]
*  But it was through pamphlets and magazines and mailings, right, and postcards. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=810.0s)]
*  This now is in the- [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=813.0s)]
*  Fox doesn't exist in 95. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=814.0s)]
*  And now there's a network effect, a network of lies effect where it can be saturated and thus seem so much more believable. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=815.0s)]
*  I was talking to Internet researchers in Boston today. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=820.0s)]
*  They say a lot of this is about repetition and saturation. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=822.0s)]
*  When you hear the same craziness over and over again, it gets a lot easier to believe that it's real. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=825.0s)]
*  And that's what happened against Ray Epps. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=828.0s)]
*  The Ray Epps theory has spread around the fringes of the far right web where you see it on 10 different websites in addition to television, in addition to your favorite congressman. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=830.0s)]
*  And at that point then it can feel so real. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=837.0s)]
*  It reminds me of the old saying about information being fast and cheap, but knowledge being slow and expensive. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=840.0s)]
*  There can be data, little bits of information that can make you feel like something is real, but the actual knowledge takes longer to catch up. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=845.0s)]
*  And that's true for, by the way, the federal government. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=852.0s)]
*  The prosecutions of the rioters, the prosecution for January 6, they're only now catching up to Ray Epps. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=854.0s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=859.0s)]
*  It's also the case that there is something, you know, titillating, I guess is the word I would use. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=860.0s)]
*  We all, I think, are drawn to this idea that there's some secret truth you don't know. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=865.0s)]
*  So when you see the Federman screenshot, you're like, wait a second, there's some second of like, wait a second, what's going on here? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=870.0s)]
*  Here's the real story. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=876.0s)]
*  It has a kind of attentional pull to it that's very powerful. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=878.0s)]
*  And I think in a lot of cases, it's monetizable. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=882.0s)]
*  Like the people that are better, they're doing it for all sorts of reasons, but one of them is it sells. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=885.0s)]
*  I saw that recently with Hurricane Lee, which turned out to be a pretty garden variety hurricane. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=891.0s)]
*  But there were claims on social media this was going to be a catastrophic event. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=895.0s)]
*  And those claims made money for the people posting them on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=898.0s)]
*  There's absolutely a monetization component of this. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=903.0s)]
*  But you know who's fighting back really well? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=905.0s)]
*  John Federman, not just coming on your program, but also on X. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=907.0s)]
*  He's responding to the trolls. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=910.0s)]
*  He's on there talking to DeSantis saying, I dress the way you campaign. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=911.0s)]
*  He's actually speaking in Internet language. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=915.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the best ways to defeat these lies. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=917.0s)]
*  I should know just to be clear, I talked to one of his body doubles last night. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=920.0s)]
*  Yes. What are you calling them? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=923.0s)]
*  Fedders. Fedders men is the plural. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=924.0s)]
*  That's Brian Stelter. Thank you very much. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=926.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=928.0s)]
*  Right now, according to basically every poll that exists, Donald Trump is crushing everyone in the Republican primary field. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=931.0s)]
*  Somehow they have not learned what was probably the single most obvious important lesson of when he crushed the previous field in 2016. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=937.0s)]
*  And the thing is this, you cannot successfully defeat Donald Trump in a Republican primary by running to his right and insisting to the base that he is not a real conservative. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=944.0s)]
*  Remember back in the 2016 cycle, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=954.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=957.0s)]
*  The Republican Party has been fighting against a single-payer system for a decade. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=967.0s)]
*  So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=972.0s)]
*  If people think Donald Trump is a conservative, prove it to me. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=976.0s)]
*  I mean really, can you trust Donald Trump to actually be a conservative? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=981.0s)]
*  I don't think so. And I think the conservative cause is worth fighting for. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=986.0s)]
*  I just don't believe Donald Trump is a reliable conservative Republican. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=992.0s)]
*  Good luck with Paul Ryan trying to find a conservative agenda with this guy. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=995.0s)]
*  No, good luck to you. The base didn't care. They don't care. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=999.0s)]
*  Not only did none of that work, it probably helped Trump enormously. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1003.0s)]
*  He was viewed by the 2016 electorate as more moderate than Hillary Clinton. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1007.0s)]
*  Yet of course all that meant nothing for how he governed. We knew that would be the case. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1011.0s)]
*  He signed the largest corporate tax cuts in history. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1015.0s)]
*  He appointed three Supreme Court justices with the explicit plan to overturn Roe v. Wade, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1018.0s)]
*  along with a slew of ideological lower court judges. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63rSc6-Otw&t=1023.0s)]
