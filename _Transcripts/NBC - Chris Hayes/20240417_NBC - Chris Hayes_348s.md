# ‘Dumb as f---’: Trump forced to hear mean tweets about himself in court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Wednesday. It's Wednesday, which must be Donald Trump's favorite day of the work week, because his New York criminal trial for election interference is not in session. Not on Wednesday. So on Wednesdays, he does not have to sit in a courtroom for eight hours where he must be quiet and cannot control what happens. And on Wednesdays, he does not have to listen as his lawyers and the judge read into the record the various nasty things that people say about him out in the real world. Because that's exactly what happened in Judge Juan Marchand's Manhattan courtroom yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, again, for any American, I think other than Trump himself, like negative talk about Donald Trump posts on social media is the most mundane thing imaginable. The fact of the matter is he's polarizing and he is unpopular. Those two things are true about him. More people dislike him than like him by a margin of nearly 12 percent, though that's been higher in the past. It's nothing new. And again, both in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump lost the popular vote in this big, great, complicated country of ours by a significant margin. By 2.8 million votes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=30.0s)]
*  By 7 million votes in 2020. Neither election was that close, to be totally honest. In all four elections, Trump has displayed what Vanity Fair calls losing touch with Trump endorsed candidate after candidate going down. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=60.0s)]
*  But because of that one victory in 2016 enabled by the anti-democratic quirk of our electoral system, many people grew to believe and this narrative persists that there's some small set of elites that dislike Donald Trump. The real folks love them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=74.0s)]
*  And that perception just kind of exploded in a place where the realest of real people congregate. Where else can you find a cross section of everyone registered to vote, holding a driver's license or paying income tax in a particular region than in a jury room in a courthouse? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=87.0s)]
*  This week in Manhattan Criminal Court, hundreds of real people reported for jury duty, as is their constitutional civic privilege in duty, where many of them were considered for the very first trial of an ex-president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=101.0s)]
*  A bunch of them told the court up front, there's no way I could serve on this jury. There's no way I could be impartial about this man. Others who made it through the initial rounds of questioning who said, I think I can do it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=114.0s)]
*  I think I'd be impartial. Then had their social media posts about the former president read aloud into the official record as they and Trump sat and listened. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=126.0s)]
*  It went something like a late night Jimmy Kimmel mean tweets skit. Here are just a few examples taken straight from the court transcript. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=136.0s)]
*  The posts also included memes like one described by Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=153.0s)]
*  Another juror Blanche said posted a one minute and 30 second AI generated video titled, I'm dumb as F Trump 2024. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=157.0s)]
*  Of course, there were some people in the jury pool who appeared to support Donald Trump too, like the man who told the judge that he would quote, would love to serve for New York and one of our great presidents. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=174.0s)]
*  Couldn't. He's got a job. He's got to go. And that man to representative of real people, Americans, a county, in fact, Manhattan, New York County, New York, New York, where 85,000 people voted for Donald Trump in 2020 out of 700,000. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=183.0s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump had to sit through yesterday. Now, keep in mind, this is a person whose entire life in some ways revolves around a sick and destructive desire for praise, as well as revenge against those who dare to say anything negative about him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=198.0s)]
*  That desire is so strong that he has an ever present aid who reportedly follows Trump around with, and I'm quoting here because it's almost not believable, a wireless printer to provide him with an ongoing stream of good news from the Internet. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=210.0s)]
*  Presumably, she followed him to the bodega in Harlem yesterday after a long day in court, where not be crazy suspect that Trump staff might have instigated these chance among the crowd. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=224.0s)]
*  Yes, Harlem bodega is infamous for the spontaneous Trump crowds that break out into four more year chance. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=240.0s)]
*  Trump's fragile ego is further on display today in a social media rant against Jimmy Kimmel, who slighted him at the Oscars last month after Trump attacked him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=259.0s)]
*  Remember, he did that thing mid performance. And according to Trump, quote, stupid Kimmel still hasn't recovered from his horrendous performance, especially when he showed he suffered from TDS, commonly known as Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=269.0s)]
*  He then went on to confuse Jimmy Kimmel with Al Pacino for like four more paragraphs in that post, which was now anyone will tell you and I'll be the first to admit, of course, Manhattan is not exactly representative of all America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=281.0s)]
*  But again, it's also home to like well over a million real actual people, real American citizens in all of our diversity and complexity and people who do not like Donald Trump or every bit as American as those who do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=294.0s)]
*  In fact, and again, obvious point, but understated, they are the majority. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=305.0s)]
*  As the first two days of the first ever criminal trial before our president has reminded us. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=311.0s)]
*  Hey everyone, MSNBC has a new and improved app. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkTcjHP85M&t=316.0s)]
