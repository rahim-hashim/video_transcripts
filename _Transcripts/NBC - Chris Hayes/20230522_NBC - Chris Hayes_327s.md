# Fox News runs with fake story about migrants displacing homeless veterans
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo)
*  So Fox News is trying to stop the bleeding in the wake of its $787 million [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=0.0s)]
*  agreement with Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest defamation settlements of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=5.2s)]
*  all time. Their latest cost-cutting move is apparently axing the network's entire [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=9.36s)]
*  investigative unit. That's according to a report from Rolling Stone. Sort of funny [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=15.16s)]
*  that Fox would fire its investigative journalists of all people after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=20.28s)]
*  settling a lawsuit about how they spread misinformation and lies. I personally [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=23.64s)]
*  don't think that group was really the source of their problems. While the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=27.92s)]
*  network makes changes behind the scenes, it appears to be business as usual on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=32.2s)]
*  air and in print in the Murdoch Empire. Let's take this front page story in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=35.92s)]
*  Murdoch-owned New York Post earlier this month. You can see it right there. Vets [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=41.52s)]
*  kicked out for migrants. Outrage as upstate hotels tell 20 homeless [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=46.0s)]
*  veterans to leave. The Post cited a nonprofit group, the Yeric Israel Tony [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Foundation, that said the veterans, quote, including a 24-year-old man in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=56.2s)]
*  desperate need of help after serving in Afghanistan, were told by the hotels [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  that their temporary housing was getting pulled out from under them. According to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  the Post, the hotels are not believed to have migrants yet or reportedly on the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=68.16s)]
*  city's shortlist to take some. Now the CEO of that nonprofit did admit that the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=72.68s)]
*  hotels didn't explicitly say the vets had to move because of the migrants, but it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=77.88s)]
*  was clear to her that was the case given the timing. But this was far more than [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=82.08s)]
*  enough for Fox News. They really ran with this story, featuring it on no less than [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=87.12s)]
*  15 different shows over the past 10 days. The network even claimed to have, crucially, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  substantiated the reporting themselves. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=98.12s)]
*  A group of veterans, some suffering from PTSD, may now be victims of New York's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=102.56s)]
*  migrant busing battle. Fox News confirms 20 homeless vets just got kicked out of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=108.72s)]
*  several hotels in the suburbs north of Manhattan to make room for those [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=114.28s)]
*  migrants getting bused in from the city. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=119.12s)]
*  Remember that phrase, Fox News confirms. Fox News confirms. Republican lawmakers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=122.52s)]
*  piled on with one New York state assemblyman, Brian Maher, introducing a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=128.52s)]
*  bill in response to the story that would ban displacing homeless veterans from [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=132.56s)]
*  presidential contender. Nikki Haley retweeted the New York Post article [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  commenting, quote, liberal insanity at work. And Speaker of the House, Kevin [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=141.44s)]
*  McCarthy, not to be left behind, blamed Joe Biden's immigration policies, calling [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=146.08s)]
*  the entire situation shameful. Todd Young of Indiana even brought up the story on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  the Senate floor. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=154.16s)]
*  In New York City, where illegal migrants have displaced homeless veterans in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=157.0s)]
*  hotels. Mayor Eric Adams said, quote, the president and the White House have failed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  this city. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  OK, do you know where I'm going with this? What do you think? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, the whole thing unraveled. A local paper, God bless them, the Mid-Hudson [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=176.08s)]
*  News reported the story was a lie, according to the hotel that was accused of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=181.24s)]
*  forcing the veterans out. The paper and the hotel debunked a purported receipt for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=185.16s)]
*  the veterans rooms provided by Assemblyman Maher as a poorly edited fake. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=189.72s)]
*  The hotel manager said there were no veterans at the hotel, none were kicked [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=195.68s)]
*  out and no other guests were told to vacate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=199.4s)]
*  So you might think, OK, maybe they just invented the whole thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=201.6s)]
*  But no, it gets better because the following day, the paper reported that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  several homeless men, not veterans, had come forward to say they had been [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=206.92s)]
*  recruited for this scam. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=211.28s)]
*  They were told they were going to meet with an elected official for a discussion [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=213.68s)]
*  and were each promised two hundred dollars along with food and alcohol. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=217.92s)]
*  After eating and drinking at a diner, the CEO of the nonprofit told them they were [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=221.0s)]
*  going to a meeting where she would be explaining how they had been kicked out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=224.72s)]
*  of a hotel to make room for migrants and coach them to, and I quote here, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  to act like we were the veterans that had been displaced. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=232.0s)]
*  The CEO admitted to the Mid-Hudson News that she provided the men from the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=235.56s)]
*  shelter to appear as if they were displaced vets, but denies offering to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=238.64s)]
*  pay them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  According to three of the men who spoke to the Times Union, they never received [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=243.92s)]
*  that money. They were promised, quote, everything was a scam. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=246.68s)]
*  She didn't have the intention of paying us anything. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=249.32s)]
*  Assemblyman Maher says he was duped by the nonprofit as well. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=252.6s)]
*  And now, well, Fox News, having gone pretty all in on this story, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  has been forced to issue a rare correction, that job falling to unlucky [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=261.48s)]
*  host Laura Ingraham on Friday night. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  Before we go, a little update on a story we brought you this week about homeless [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=268.88s)]
*  vets being displaced from hotels so that illegals could move in. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=272.92s)]
*  Turns out the group behind the claim made it up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=277.2s)]
*  We have no clue as to why anyone would do such a thing, but we'll bring you any [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=281.64s)]
*  updates should they come. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=285.84s)]
*  Oh, at the end of the show on a Friday night, you just got in there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=287.44s)]
*  Yeah, Laura, why would anyone want to make up a story that's too good to check [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=290.76s)]
*  but plays directly into the most deranged bias of your conservative audience? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=295.96s)]
*  I can't imagine Fox News airing those kinds of lies, but I guess there's a first [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=300.48s)]
*  time for everything. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cecsmXCsRDo&t=304.48s)]
