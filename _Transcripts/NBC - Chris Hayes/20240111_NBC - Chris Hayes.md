# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 11  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=0.0s)]
*  I would rather lose by telling the truth than lie in order to win. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Chris Christie drops out with no endorsement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=10.68s)]
*  Anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to be president of the United States [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=14.32s)]
*  is unfit themselves to be president of the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=22.16s)]
*  As the rest of the field panders to MAGA. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=26.26s)]
*  Don't just build the wall, build both walls. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=29.98s)]
*  Anthony, you are fired. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=32.34s)]
*  Tonight what Christie's departure means to the race and a party led by an indicted front [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=34.58s)]
*  runner. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=39.06s)]
*  That. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=40.06s)]
*  Sits here with a smug look on his face and runs away when it's my turn to talk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=41.06s)]
*  How the tent collapsed on the MAGA circus with Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and George [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=47.34s)]
*  Conway on how Trump attorneys walk into a trap in a D.C. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=52.5s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=55.62s)]
*  All In starts right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=56.62s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=63.5s)]
*  I'm Chris Haver. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=64.5s)]
*  We've got a major development tonight in the race for the Republican nomination. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=65.5s)]
*  Chris Christie, the only candidate in the Republican side telling the truth about Donald Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=67.98s)]
*  and his attempted coup was essentially forced out of the primary race. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=72.94s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=77.32s)]
*  Now, just before he made the announcement that he is dropping out, the former governor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=78.32s)]
*  of New Jersey was caught on a hot mic bluntly explaining how his campaign's message just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=81.74s)]
*  did not resonate with the voters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=88.3s)]
*  People don't want to hear it when they don't want to hear it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=90.5s)]
*  We know we're right, but they don't want to hear it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=94.94s)]
*  And there's, you know, we couldn't have been any clearer if we couldn't have been any more [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  any more director worked any harder. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  So you know, yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=105.86s)]
*  Well, when you give land to China and places like that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=106.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you get. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=111.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=112.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=113.66s)]
*  I mean, look, she's spent 68 million so far just on TV. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=114.66s)]
*  She's spent 68 million so far, 59 million by DeSantis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=116.46s)]
*  And we spent 12. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=120.86s)]
*  I mean, who's punching above their weight and who's getting a return on their investment, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=121.86s)]
*  you know, and she's going to get smoked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=126.14s)]
*  And you and I both know it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=128.7s)]
*  She's not up to this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=129.94s)]
*  She's still 20 points behind Trump in the race, right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=130.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=134.34s)]
*  You're still going to carry on, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=135.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=136.82s)]
*  Always. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=137.82s)]
*  I talk to DeSantis calls me petrified that I would. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=138.82s)]
*  Now it can't be sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=144.3s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=145.3s)]
*  Sounds like Christie is talking about Nikki Haley in the she's going to get smoked, who, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=146.3s)]
*  of course, has the wealthy donor class or some significant portion of it behind her, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=149.7s)]
*  along with Ron DeSantis, the former top challenger to Donald Trump now sitting in a very distant [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=154.58s)]
*  second place in Iowa, less than a week before the caucus. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=160.18s)]
*  And after Chris Christie laid out the facts behind closed doors, he took to that stage [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=163.26s)]
*  in New Hampshire and basically repeated everything he said in private to the entire audience. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=167.14s)]
*  If Donald Trump becomes the nominee of this party, the moment that it happened was when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=174.34s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott and Mike Pence and Doug Burgum and Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=184.18s)]
*  stood on that stage in Milwaukee in August. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=195.62s)]
*  And when we were asked, would you support someone who is a convicted felon to be president [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=200.72s)]
*  of the United States, they raised their hands. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=206.18s)]
*  They raised their hands. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  And I did not and will not. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=212.56s)]
*  And I cannot countenance that behavior. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=216.96s)]
*  Anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to be president of the United States [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=221.96s)]
*  is unfit themselves to be president of the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=229.44s)]
*  I want to promise you this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=233.12s)]
*  I am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=235.32s)]
*  of the United States again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's more important than my own personal ambition. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, as Chris Christie bluntly describes, none of the remaining Republicans in the race [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  have taken a stand against the insurrectionist ex-president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=254.76s)]
*  Christie was the only candidate in the Republican field stating the plain truth about Donald [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=258.44s)]
*  Trump and his total unfitness for office, along with, we should say, Issa Hutchinson, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=262.84s)]
*  who's still in the race, but not on the debate stage or anywhere close. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=266.32s)]
*  But he did not find an audience for that message. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=270.28s)]
*  No one has among the Republican primary voters. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=272.2s)]
*  And again, to Christie's credit, he did not attempt to pander to the MAGA base. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=275.24s)]
*  He had a theory of the case. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=279.14s)]
*  He was going to go out, tell the truth about Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  But as it turns out, pandering the MAGA base is kind of the name of the game in Republican [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=283.28s)]
*  politics right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=287.96s)]
*  The fundamental dynamic of the Trump era that created that base is this kind of transformation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=290.56s)]
*  of the base of the party towards the discontented white working class, predominantly white voters, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=297.72s)]
*  white conservative voters without college degrees. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=305.56s)]
*  And that base of the party as the kind of bedrock for electoral success in Republican [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=308.96s)]
*  primaries has created a very weird dynamic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=315.56s)]
*  And you see it everywhere. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=319.54s)]
*  What it has done is it made it increasingly difficult for Republican politicians who themselves [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  are not part of that base to connect to their own voters. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  So they're playing this kind of game of translation all the time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=332.1s)]
*  We see it play out all the time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=335.42s)]
*  It is a big part, I submit, of why Republican politicians in the Trump era sounds so weirdly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=337.12s)]
*  cringey, like just off. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=346.14s)]
*  And you're like, what are you saying? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=348.4s)]
*  Here's the ultimate example, that guy, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=351.44s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=353.18s)]
*  So Florida governor, product of Harvard and Yale, some of the most elite institutions [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=354.18s)]
*  in American life, a kind of winner of the American meritocracy comes out on the top, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=357.96s)]
*  right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=362.28s)]
*  A member of the very groups and institutions that the base absolutely despises. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=363.28s)]
*  And they feel alienated and shut out from that world. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=368.24s)]
*  But culturally also, you know, that's the world that produced him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=371.2s)]
*  So when Ron DeSantis tries to relate to those voters, to tell them what he thinks they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=374.92s)]
*  want to hear, well, it sounds like this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=379.6s)]
*  So because the woke represents a war on truth, we have no other recourse but to wage a war [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=384.36s)]
*  on woke. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=391.64s)]
*  We fight the woke in the schools. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=393.02000000000004s)]
*  We fight the woke in the legislature. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  We will fight the woke in education. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  We will fight the woke in the corporations. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=399.56s)]
*  We will fight the woke in the halls of Congress. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=401.64s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=404.32s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=407.92s)]
*  If someone in the drug cartels is sneaking fence and all across the border when I'm [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=409.08s)]
*  president, that's going to be the last thing they do. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=412.84s)]
*  We're going to shoot them stone cold dead. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=414.88s)]
*  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=416.52s)]
*  This is your governor speaking. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=417.86s)]
*  Today's training evolution, dogfighting, taking on the corporate media. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=419.24s)]
*  The rules of engagement are as follows. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=423.96s)]
*  Number one, don't fire unless fired upon. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=426.8s)]
*  But when they fire, you fire back with overwhelming force. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=430.2s)]
*  I mean, we could have played you an hour of stuff that level. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=434.8s)]
*  OK, now, granted, DeSantis is probably the most extreme example of, again, this sort [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=438.24s)]
*  of dynamic in which you have Republican politicians who are products of the American elite, right, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=443.44s)]
*  embarrassingly trying to figure out how to talk to the MAGA base that's alien and from [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's the overarching dynamic of the entire party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  It explains a lot. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=457.08s)]
*  Like Nikki Haley, OK, she's the other one, right? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=458.92s)]
*  And she's doing OK with sort of college educated voters in the primary, right, the people that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=461.28s)]
*  want to move past Trump. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=465.44s)]
*  And she knows how to talk to college educated wealthy conservatives in the Charleston suburbs, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=472.08s)]
*  She knows that vocabulary. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=473.08s)]
*  She knows that messaging. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=474.08s)]
*  She's good at it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=475.08s)]
*  She cannot speak in the register that Donald Trump can to his base. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=476.08s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm an accountant. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  Went on to Clemson. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=482.23999999999995s)]
*  Go Tigers. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=483.76s)]
*  The only thing Joe Biden needs to spend more of is more time in retirement. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=485.88s)]
*  He claimed I'm not in my prime. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=490.2s)]
*  In which I responded, hold my beer. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  Now this has been the problem for virtually every candidate in the Republican Party. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  So we got to just skate to where the puck is going, not just where the puck is. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=503.74s)]
*  Don't just build the wall. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=507.8s)]
*  Build both walls. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=508.96s)]
*  Can't just complete the wall. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=509.96s)]
*  Use the military to seal the Swiss cheese for the tunnels that they're actually building [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=511.48s)]
*  underneath that wall. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=515.04s)]
*  That's like Harvard section, dude. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=516.8s)]
*  You can go ahead, guy in your section who then uses his Ivy League connections to create [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=518.84s)]
*  a pharma investment that goes huge and makes a lot of money. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  That's the guy. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=528.36s)]
*  Tribune to the working class. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=529.36s)]
*  Now, the most extreme examples of this in the Republican Party actually come out of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=530.36s)]
*  Congress. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=533.72s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty common. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=534.72s)]
*  You've got people like, for instance, Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=535.72s)]
*  Their whole life now is like cosplaying as regular Joe's, cosplaying as the voters they're [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=538.42s)]
*  trying to channel. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=542.16s)]
*  Stanford and Yale law grad Hawley, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, infamously [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  tried to show he stands with the MAGA mob on January 6, raising a fist to the crowd [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=548.18s)]
*  gathered at the Capitol. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=553.5s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=554.8599999999999s)]
*  But when the violent mob entered the building, Hawley, caught on surveillance cameras in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=556.2199999999999s)]
*  this video released by the January 6 committee, ran away from the base he appeared to support [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=559.8599999999999s)]
*  hours earlier. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=564.5799999999999s)]
*  Ted Cruz, a complete creature of the elite, the Ivy League, just he's the leader in this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=566.5s)]
*  field. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=571.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, even better than DeSantis, just regularly putting on cringeworthy performances. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=572.8599999999999s)]
*  Left is so bad. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=578.54s)]
*  They're so unhappy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=580.0999999999999s)]
*  They're so pissed off. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=581.3s)]
*  And by the way, if you were a liberal woman and you had to sleep with those weenies, you'd [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  be pissed too. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=594.26s)]
*  And now these idiots have come out and said drink two beers a week. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=595.26s)]
*  That's their guideline. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=600.02s)]
*  Well, I got to tell you, if they want us to drink two beers a week, frankly, they can [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=601.02s)]
*  kiss my ass. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=604.8599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=606.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=607.42s)]
*  Who's buying it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=608.42s)]
*  I mean, honestly, like just politics aside, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=610.62s)]
*  Like substance aside, who is, I mean, who is buying that? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=613.06s)]
*  That is how they think these people want to be talked to. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=618.78s)]
*  In the end, no one in the Republican Party has figured out how to talk to the base, well, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=622.2199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's base, except for Donald Trump. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=627.42s)]
*  And that's a whole other topic for another day. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=629.9399999999999s)]
*  I think partly his ability to do it is born of his cellular authentic sense of grievance. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=632.9s)]
*  They're just absolutely just resentment driving his personal being on the planet from the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=639.9s)]
*  moment he was a child. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=647.66s)]
*  And there's something about that that's like genuinely authentic they like. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=649.1s)]
*  And through that, the ex-president effortlessly does connect with the group. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=653.1s)]
*  The entire structure of the party is centered around the group that he can talk to. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=656.78s)]
*  That is why we are where we are now, with less than a week to go before the first votes [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=660.42s)]
*  of 2024 are cast. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=664.3s)]
*  Amanda Carpenter is a writer and editor at the nonprofit anti-authoritarianism group [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=666.78s)]
*  Protect Democracy, author of Gaslighting America, Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=670.62s)]
*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist in the New York Times. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=676.0999999999999s)]
*  His latest piece is titled Imagine If Trump Loses. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=681.5799999999999s)]
*  First, let's just start with each of you, the development of Christie dropping out on [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  what it means. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  Amanda, let me start with you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=687.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I kind of see a thread. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=689.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I sort of laughing at some of those clips you played. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=691.7800000000001s)]
*  And I just want to make it clear, I'm a proud Midwest school graduate and I was not Ted [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=694.5s)]
*  Cruz's communication director when he was speaking MAGA like that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=698.6600000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=701.98s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=703.46s)]
*  And this has kind of been the whole story throughout Trump. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  Like, why do these smart, educated people go along with this nonsense? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=706.1s)]
*  And what Chris Christie said in his speech today, where he had the moment where he said, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  I did these things in 2016 and all the way for many years after because I put ambition [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=715.42s)]
*  ahead of decision making. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=722.3399999999999s)]
*  And that just clicked a lot of things into place for me because we all sort of know this. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=724.26s)]
*  But you see this so many times. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=728.5799999999999s)]
*  All these politicians put their ambition ahead of rational decision making when they know [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=730.62s)]
*  better, when they know that they are parodying this kind of MAGA silly speech. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=736.74s)]
*  They know it sounds cringe, but they think that is what will get them ahead. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=741.74s)]
*  They think that is what voters want to hear. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=745.5799999999999s)]
*  And the reason it doesn't work, because that is not actually genuine to who they are and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  what they think internally in their past experiences. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=752.14s)]
*  But they just see this as a shortcut. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=755.38s)]
*  This is how I speak to the MAGA base. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=757.14s)]
*  Instead of actually doing the work of how we create a better political system or their [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=759.66s)]
*  own agenda or how we actually have an enduring coalition, they don't want to put in the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  work because they are scared of the base, they are scared of the backlash, and they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=770.42s)]
*  don't actually understand their own voters. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=774.42s)]
*  Yeah, that is the key. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=776.86s)]
*  They are scared of them, they also don't understand them, which I think is honestly a really important [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=777.86s)]
*  dynamic here taking shape in this primary. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=781.38s)]
*  You know, Jamila, I was thinking about this in the context of democratic politics, which [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=782.9399999999999s)]
*  I know better and have sort of covered more closely in some ways. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=786.4599999999999s)]
*  This happens all the time because the Democrats are a very heterogeneous coalition, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=789.66s)]
*  So you've got like old white politicians who go to like, you know, barbecues in black [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=794.1s)]
*  neighborhoods in urban environments and black churches where they have to do a little bit [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=799.82s)]
*  of code switching and sometimes it gets real cringy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=803.02s)]
*  Or you've got the Senate candidates who's like, como estamos, you know, when they show [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=806.26s)]
*  up at like, you know, an event for Latinos. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=810.26s)]
*  That is part of politics, is doing that stuff. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=813.74s)]
*  But there is at least an authentic connection to black voters, to Latino voters, to different [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=816.4200000000001s)]
*  kinds of voters in the fabric of the coalition, the Democratic Party. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=822.46s)]
*  I think it's just missing peace in Republican politics right now. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  I think also one of the key differences between the two parties, coalitions, is that the Democratic [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=833.3000000000001s)]
*  Party coalition is very much you might call like a brokerage party, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=838.1s)]
*  Like it's various groups of policy demanders, use a political science term, like trying [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=841.58s)]
*  to get something out of the government. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=846.82s)]
*  And each of the coalition partners are working with each other, understanding that. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=849.78s)]
*  They're obviously negotiating and there's conflict on these things. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=854.2199999999999s)]
*  But there's something substantive at the end of the day that say black voters want, that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=857.18s)]
*  Latino voters want, that civil rights groups want, that LGBT groups want. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=861.14s)]
*  They want something concrete from the federal state. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  The Republican coalition is very different. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  And especially under Trump, it's much less of that kind of group of policy demanders. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are policies that people want. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  But what the voters seem to want more than anything is for a candidate to reflect back [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  onto them their sense of grievance, right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=884.28s)]
*  And so Trump, because as you mentioned, as you said, has this very authentic grievance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=887.64s)]
*  about him. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  He can do that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=893.4s)]
*  He's also a longtime celebrity and show him and he has those skills. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=894.4s)]
*  Other regular Republican politicians have a very difficult time with this because it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=898.04s)]
*  just isn't their experience and they don't really know what else to do in terms of appealing [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=902.16s)]
*  to these voters. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=908.08s)]
*  It is not lost on me that the Republican politicians who have done best in terms of the connection [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=908.72s)]
*  with voters in the Trump era are people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was like an influencer [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=914.5200000000001s)]
*  beforehand. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=920.64s)]
*  It kind of has that kind of like grasping sense of I want it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=921.5200000000001s)]
*  Kerry Lake in Arizona, I think, really connects to these people for similar reasons. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=924.84s)]
*  But if you're like if you're like an Ivy League guy who, you know, you're just kind of putting [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=929.84s)]
*  on a role, it's really hard to reflect that back at someone. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=935.16s)]
*  Easier to say, I will if you elect me, I'll do these things for you and we can build our [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=938.8s)]
*  connection this way. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=943.24s)]
*  Much harder to say, if you elect me, I'll be your avatar of rage. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=944.24s)]
*  Like, no one's buying that from Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that is extremely well put. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=951.24s)]
*  I mean, we should say the polling here just to sort of give the kind of top lines right [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=957.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, again, in New Hampshire, where you have unaffiliated voters, Democrats and independents [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  all can vote, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=961.88s)]
*  The latest poll had Trump up by seven over Haley. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=963.5600000000001s)]
*  Christie was taking 12 points. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=966.4s)]
*  It's possible him leaving helps Haley there. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=968.16s)]
*  You know, if you look at the sort of national polling, it's still just an enormous Donald [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=972.64s)]
*  Trump. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=976.96s)]
*  You know, he's got 49 and no one's even really closing Chris Christie's at 2 percent, which, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=977.96s)]
*  you know, again, Amanda, Christie at least had a theory of the case, right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to get in the race. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=986.96s)]
*  I'm going to be the Trump is bad actually candidate. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=987.96s)]
*  And I'm just going to say that until to see how far it takes me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=992.48s)]
*  And it does feel like today was a definitive ruling on that approach, at least within a [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=995.88s)]
*  Republican primaries, which we all know. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  But I'm glad he gave it a try, I guess is what I would say. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1002.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's important to test the case. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  And with him dropping out, there's enough, you know, voters there to make it interesting [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  for Haley in New Hampshire. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1011.6s)]
*  But you know, the next logical question is what does Christie do next? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1013.0s)]
*  And I want to tamp down on this like push, be like, oh, now he needs to go out and be [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1017.0s)]
*  a surrogate for Biden. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1021.64s)]
*  Now he immediately needs to get like a slot at the DNC. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1022.64s)]
*  Chris Christie speaking to Republicans and saying why Donald Trump is unfit is very important. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1026.36s)]
*  And the second that he sort of becomes a Democrat, he's going to lose that credibility. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1033.2s)]
*  And so maybe he does endorse Biden later. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1037.04s)]
*  But I don't think there should be a rush to do that yet, because we need this sort of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1039.04s)]
*  civics education. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1042.92s)]
*  We wonder why do Republican voters think the way they do? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1044.2s)]
*  Why do they support Trump? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1046.96s)]
*  There's this self-fulfilling doom loop where Trump tells them something, his mega media [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1048.08s)]
*  echoes it, all the go along politicians like the Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, repeat it and give [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1052.52s)]
*  cover to it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1056.92s)]
*  The voters get it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1057.92s)]
*  And then they reflected back to everybody and on and on it goes. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1058.92s)]
*  So if Chris Christie can try to get in there a little bit and talk to the next few months [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1061.48s)]
*  about like, hey, maybe this is why like presidential immunity matters. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1066.24s)]
*  I don't know something like that going out to the courts. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1071.16s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1073.76s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1074.76s)]
*  I think part of it is that Trump is one of his skills. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1075.8s)]
*  And I don't know how intentional is, is he is polarizing, you know, intentionally. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1078.44s)]
*  It's a which side are you on kind of situation. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1082.84s)]
*  It's a wedge he's driving all the time. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1085.08s)]
*  And so you can't what we've seen this primary is you can't be kind of like noncommittal [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1087.26s)]
*  on him. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1091.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1092.4s)]
*  And so once someone is, you know, a never Trump or then they can be safely discarded [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1093.4s)]
*  inside the universe that Amanda's talking. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1097.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1100.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1102.36s)]
*  I'm going to disagree a little bit with Amanda here and say that insofar that the goal is [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1103.36s)]
*  to maybe persuade like hardcore Republican voters, I'm not sure Chris Christie can do [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1108.8s)]
*  this exactly for the reason you mentioned, Chris, for this dynamic, that the moment he [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1112.52s)]
*  begins speaking openly against Trump, there is a mental model to put him in. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1116.7s)]
*  He is a never Trump or we don't listen to him. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  But the universal voters and voters who might even vote for Republicans, it's much broader [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1124.2s)]
*  than just people who vote in Republican primaries. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1129.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1131.08s)]
*  There are so many voters who may consider voting for Trump in this election. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1132.84s)]
*  And I think Christie, if he's going to be strategic about this, is best situated speaking [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  to those people. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1141.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1142.12s)]
*  Like people who aren't, you know, they aren't following politics closely. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1143.12s)]
*  They may be voted for Biden. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1146.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe they didn't vote. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1148.3s)]
*  They may be thinking about Trump this time because they sense that, you know, I think [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1149.36s)]
*  there'd be a better option. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1153.12s)]
*  And Christie can say to them, listen, I'm a Republican. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1154.12s)]
*  I understand this feeling. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1157.24s)]
*  I don't like Biden either, but this is not the time to make that choice. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1159.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1162.24s)]
*  We don't need so many Republicans that turn into Democrats. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1163.24s)]
*  A long, durable pro-democracy coalition of Republicans and Democrats who can disagree [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1166.08s)]
*  and make, you know, fight for the policies on the merits and a safe and fair and free [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1172.48s)]
*  way. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1176.48s)]
*  Amanda Carpenter, Jamel Bowie, thank you both. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1177.48s)]
*  Coming up with no real goals besides groveling before Donald Trump, House Republicans are [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  flailing again. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1185.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett joins me on today's MAGA chaos ahead. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1186.56s)]
*  Congress has rung in 2024, the new session, and when House Republicans are in session, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1193.6s)]
*  there are two things you can pretty much count on. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1197.56s)]
*  One, they're not doing much legislating and two, they are creating incredibly embarrassing [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1199.84s)]
*  spectacles, although there is a little bit of movement on the legislative part. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1204.48s)]
*  You know, Congress, of course, constitutionally required to fund the U.S. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1208.36s)]
*  government. And with the budget deadline in nine days and the threat of yet another [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1210.9199999999998s)]
*  government shutdown looming, there's some good news, which is that it looks like they've [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1214.72s)]
*  hammered out a spending deal that is agreeable to the top leaders in both parties. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1218.8s)]
*  Naturally, that has predictably enraged the far-right conservatives in the House Freedom [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1222.96s)]
*  Caucus who once again feel sold out. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1227.28s)]
*  Like Texas Republican Chip Roy, who's even raised the possibility of a motion to vacate [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1230.3600000000001s)]
*  the House speakership. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1234.68s)]
*  Yes, to unseat his own new Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, a guy who took over after far-right [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1236.0s)]
*  Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, for basically the exact same thing, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1241.6s)]
*  keeping the government running, actually getting a deal done. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1245.84s)]
*  And who knows, maybe we'll burn through half a dozen Republican House speakers before [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1249.52s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1253.1999999999998s)]
*  Now, it's absurd in no small part because the Republican Party's problems don't have [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1254.56s)]

*  They are about the nature of the Republican Party at this moment. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1260.24s)]
*  The party has basically retreated from any actual policy agenda on the many issues and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1264.08s)]
*  problems that face the nation and that government exists to address. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1269.2s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  People are angry about grocery prices. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay, understandably, they've been high. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  What is the Republican plan to lower grocery store prices? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1278.56s)]
*  I genuinely have no idea. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1283.2s)]
*  I could not possibly even begin to tell you, and I do this for a living. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1284.72s)]
*  They're not talking about that or any other substantive policy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1288.0s)]
*  Of course, there is one exception. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1291.2s)]
*  There's one thing they will talk about, which is the border. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1292.4s)]
*  They will hold press conferences there. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1296.0s)]
*  They will entertain plans to essentially end the American system of asylum, as we know [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1297.68s)]
*  it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1301.68s)]
*  They will demand more money to build Trump's wall. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  They will threaten to sink budget deals and risk government shutdowns or any other nonrelated [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1304.48s)]
*  stuff just to put more money and guns on the border. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1309.8400000000001s)]
*  And as much as I find all that odious, it is at least, I have to say, recognizable as [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1314.64s)]
*  a policy position. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1320.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  They want to beef up security at the border and end asylum. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1322.16s)]
*  Once you get past the border as Republican issue number two, number one, what's number [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1325.6s)]
*  two? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1330.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1331.2s)]
*  What can you name? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1332.16s)]
*  Attacking trans healthcare? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1334.0s)]
*  Ending aid to Ukraine? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1335.92s)]
*  Maybe? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1337.52s)]
*  I mean, that's it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  Just an enormous vacuum on everything else, all the other things one might have politics [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1340.56s)]
*  and positions about. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1346.56s)]
*  There is not even a story they have to tell about the great issues of the day that America [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1347.44s)]
*  faces. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1351.84s)]
*  There's no policy prescriptions. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1352.4s)]
*  There's no debates about policy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1353.76s)]
*  They're certainly not articulating their views on, for instance, abortion, which they have [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1355.76s)]
*  essentially run away from, at least in public, though not behind the scenes, or deregulation. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1359.2s)]
*  All the other past conservative priorities, they still push whenever they can, right? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1365.04s)]
*  When they have the levers of power, but they don't actually try to argue for them in the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1368.72s)]
*  public sphere anymore. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1372.64s)]
*  And so in place of that, of policy and politics about real issues, things governments can [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1374.48s)]
*  do, you get spectacle. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1378.4s)]
*  You get Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace, professional [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1380.0s)]
*  microphone talkers with no legislation, lots of grievances, running their party, running [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1384.4s)]
*  interference for Donald Trump's sustained assault on American democracy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1389.6s)]
*  This is what they spend all their time doing. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1393.12s)]
*  And today they did it again. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1395.76s)]
*  They spent their time on their favorite topic, the topic that consumes and obsesses them, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1396.96s)]
*  which is thinking about, talking about, reading the emails of the president's adult son, Hunter [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1401.12s)]
*  Biden. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1405.84s)]
*  You are the epitome of white privilege. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1406.34s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1410.02s)]
*  You have no balls to come up here and- [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1411.1399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, point of inquiry. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1414.02s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, um- [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1415.54s)]
*  The lady's recognized- [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1417.4599999999998s)]
*  If the gentle lady wants to hear from Hunter Biden, we can hear from him right now, Mr. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1419.54s)]
*  Chairman. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1422.82s)]
*  Let's take a vote and hear from Hunter Biden. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1423.1399999999999s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1425.1399999999999s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, order, order. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1426.1s)]
*  Let's take a vote. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1428.8999999999999s)]
*  Who wants to hear from Hunter right now, today? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1429.86s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1434.34s)]
*  Come on. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1435.06s)]
*  Who wants to hear from Hunter? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1435.62s)]
*  No one. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1439.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1440.1s)]
*  Excuse me, Hunter. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1442.02s)]
*  Apparently you're afraid of my words. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1443.3s)]
*  Will the gentleman yield for a question? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1447.62s)]
*  No, unfortunately, sir, you did not yield to me, so I will not yield to you. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1449.1399999999999s)]
*  The context for that particular spectacle is amazing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1453.6999999999998s)]
*  Republicans talked about Hunter Biden, they trashed Hunter Biden, they ultimately voted [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1456.1s)]
*  right down party lines to recommend the House hold him in contempt for not talking to them [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1459.4599999999998s)]
*  behind closed doors, even though he offered to testify in public, all while Hunter Biden [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1463.62s)]
*  was sitting there ready to talk then and there, basically calling their bluff and not being [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1469.1399999999999s)]
*  listened to. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1474.26s)]
*  And Democrats noticed. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1475.4599999999998s)]
*  So why are we here? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1477.86s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump insisted to numerous Republicans and in public and on Twitter and on Truth [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1479.06s)]
*  Social that Joe Biden be impeached. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1485.9399999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1488.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, because Donald Trump was impeached twice. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1489.4599999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1491.9399999999998s)]
*  I know, obviously, what we're seeing today has been quite insane. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1492.74s)]
*  We've seen pornographic images. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1496.18s)]
*  We've talked about white privilege, but we haven't seen any sort of evidence linking [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1497.86s)]
*  President Biden to any sort of wrongdoing. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1503.94s)]
*  And let me tell you why nobody wants to talk to y'all behind closed doors, because y'all [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1506.42s)]
*  lie. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1509.78s)]
*  That's just the bottom line. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1510.58s)]
*  You have done it thus far in this investigation. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1512.02s)]
*  You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every single hearing, y'all [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1514.66s)]
*  spin, spin, spin. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1519.78s)]
*  I don't know how y'all are still standing right now. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1520.82s)]
*  That was Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett laying into Republicans for this particular [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  substance free spectacle. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1528.6599999999999s)]
*  And she will join me just after the break. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1530.34s)]
*  Congress has rung in 2024, the new session, and when House Republicans are in session, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1536.02s)]
*  there are two things you can pretty much count on. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1539.86s)]
*  One, they're not doing much legislating and two, they are creating incredibly embarrassing [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1542.26s)]
*  spectacles, although there is a little bit of movement on the legislative part. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1546.82s)]
*  Congress, of course, constitutionally required to fund the U.S. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1551.06s)]
*  government. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1553.3s)]
*  And with the budget deadline in nine days and the threat of yet another government shutdown [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1553.9399999999998s)]
*  looming, there's some good news, which is that it looks like they've hammered out a [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1557.86s)]
*  spending deal that is agreeable to the top leaders in both parties. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1561.9399999999998s)]
*  Naturally, that has predictably enraged the far-right conservatives in the House Freedom [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1565.3799999999999s)]
*  Caucus, who once again feel sold out. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1569.9399999999998s)]
*  Like Texas Republican Chip Roy, who's even raised the possibility of a motion to vacate [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1572.58s)]
*  the House speakership. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1577.06s)]
*  Yes, to unseat his own new Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, a guy who took over after far-right [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1578.42s)]
*  Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, for basically the exact same thing, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1584.02s)]
*  keeping the government running, actually getting a deal done. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1588.3400000000001s)]
*  And who knows, maybe we'll burn through half a dozen Republican House speakers before [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1591.94s)]
*  election day. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1595.7s)]
*  Now, it's absurd in no small part because the Republican Party's problems don't have [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1596.98s)]
*  anything to do with Mike Johnson personally. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1600.98s)]
*  They are about the nature of the Republican Party at this moment. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1602.66s)]
*  The party has basically retreated from any actual policy agenda on the many issues and [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1606.5s)]
*  problems that face the nation and that government exists to address. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1611.7s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1615.78s)]
*  People are angry about grocery prices. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1616.5s)]
*  Understandably, they've been high. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1618.82s)]
*  What is the Republican plan to lower grocery store prices? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1621.06s)]
*  I genuinely have no idea. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1625.7s)]
*  I could not possibly even begin to tell you, and I do this for a living. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1627.14s)]
*  They're not talking about that or any other substantive policy. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1630.42s)]
*  Of course, there is one exception. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1633.6200000000001s)]
*  There's one thing they will talk about, which is the border. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1634.82s)]
*  They will hold press conferences there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1638.4199999999998s)]
*  They will entertain plans to essentially end the American system of asylum as we know [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1640.1799999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1644.1799999999998s)]
*  They will demand more money to build Trump's wall. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1644.26s)]
*  They will threaten to sink budget deals and risk government shutdowns or any other non-related [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1646.8999999999999s)]
*  stuff just to put more money and guns on the border. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1652.26s)]
*  And as much as I find all that odious, it is at least, I have to say, recognizable as [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1657.06s)]
*  a policy position. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1662.58s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1663.62s)]
*  They want to beef up security at the border and end asylum. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1664.66s)]
*  Once you get past the border as Republican issue number two, number one, what's number [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1668.02s)]
*  two? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1673.0600000000002s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  What can you name? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1674.66s)]
*  Attacking trans healthcare? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1676.42s)]
*  Ending aid to Ukraine? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1678.42s)]
*  Maybe? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1679.94s)]
*  I mean, that's it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1681.38s)]
*  Just an enormous vacuum on everything else, all the other things one might have politics [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1682.98s)]
*  and positions about. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1688.98s)]
*  There is not even a story they have to tell about the great issues of the day that America [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1689.94s)]
*  faces. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1694.26s)]
*  There's no policy prescriptions. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1694.9s)]
*  There's no debates about policy. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1696.26s)]
*  They're certainly not articulating their views on, for instance, abortion, which they have [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1698.18s)]
*  essentially run away from, at least in public, though not behind the scenes, or deregulation. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1701.62s)]
*  All the other past conservative priorities, they still push whenever they can, right, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1707.54s)]
*  when they have the levers of power, but they don't actually try to argue for them in the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1711.14s)]
*  public sphere anymore. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1715.14s)]
*  And so in place of that, of policy and politics about real issues, things governments can do, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1716.98s)]
*  you get spectacle. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1721.46s)]
*  You get Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace, professional [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1722.5s)]
*  microphone talkers with no legislation, lots of grievances, running their party, running [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1726.82s)]
*  interference for Donald Trump's sustained assault on American democracy. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1732.1s)]
*  This is what they spend all their time doing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1735.54s)]
*  And today they did it again. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1738.18s)]
*  They spent their time on their favorite topic, the topic that consumes and obsesses them, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1739.46s)]
*  which is thinking about, talking about, reading the emails of the president's adult son, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1743.54s)]
*  Hunter Biden. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1748.02s)]
*  You are the epitome of white privilege. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1748.58s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1752.4199999999998s)]
*  You have no balls to come up here and- [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1753.54s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, point of inquiry. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, um- [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1757.9399999999998s)]
*  The lady recognized- [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1759.86s)]
*  If the gentle, if the gentlelady wants to hear from Hunter Biden, we can hear from him [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1761.22s)]
*  right now, Mr. Chairman. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1764.58s)]
*  Let's take a vote and hear from Hunter Biden. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1765.54s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1767.54s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, order, order. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1768.5s)]
*  Let's take a vote. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1771.3s)]
*  Who wants to hear from Hunter right now, today? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1772.26s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1776.74s)]
*  Come on. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1777.54s)]
*  Who wants to hear from Hunter? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1778.1s)]
*  No one. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1781.86s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1782.58s)]
*  Excuse me, Hunter. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1784.5s)]
*  Apparently you're afraid of my words. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1785.78s)]
*  Will the gentleman yield for a question? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1790.1s)]
*  No, unfortunately, sir, you did not yield to me, so I will not yield to you. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1791.62s)]
*  The context for that particular spectacle is amazing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1796.1799999999998s)]
*  Republicans talked about Hunter Biden, they trashed Hunter Biden, they ultimately voted [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1798.58s)]
*  right down party lines to recommend the House hold him in contempt for not talking to them [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1801.9399999999998s)]
*  behind closed doors, even though he offered to testify in public, all while Hunter Biden [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1806.1s)]
*  was sitting there ready to talk then and there, basically calling their bluff and not being [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1811.62s)]
*  listened to. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1816.74s)]
*  And Democrats noticed. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1817.9399999999998s)]
*  So why are we here? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1820.34s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump insisted to numerous Republicans and in public and on Twitter [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1821.54s)]
*  and on Truth Social that Joe Biden be impeached. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1827.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1831.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, because Donald Trump was impeached twice. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1831.9399999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1834.4199999999998s)]
*  I know, obviously, what we're seeing today has been quite insane. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1835.22s)]
*  We've seen pornographic images. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1838.58s)]
*  We've talked about white privilege, but we haven't seen any sort of evidence linking [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1840.26s)]
*  President Biden to any sort of wrongdoing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1846.42s)]
*  And let me tell you why nobody wants to talk to y'all behind closed doors, because y'all lie. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1848.82s)]
*  That's just the bottom line. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1853.06s)]
*  You have done it thus far in this investigation. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1854.5s)]
*  You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every single hearing, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1857.14s)]
*  y'all spin, spin, spin. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1861.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know how y'all are still standing right now. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1863.3s)]
*  That was Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett laying into Republicans for this particular [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1866.6599999999999s)]
*  Substance Theory spectacle. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1871.1399999999999s)]
*  And she will join me just after the break. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1872.74s)]
*  Something most people suspected is now official. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1878.02s)]
*  Twenty twenty three was the hottest year on record and not just by a hair. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1880.6599999999999s)]
*  Take a look at this staggering chart showing the monthly global temperature compared with [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1885.62s)]
*  pre-industrial levels. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1890.02s)]
*  That thick orange line at the very tippy, tippy top is twenty twenty three. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1891.1399999999999s)]
*  The rest of the lines are every other year since nineteen forty. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1896.18s)]
*  Last year just absolutely smashed the record. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1901.06s)]
*  According to the director of the European Union's climate change service, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1904.5s)]
*  twenty twenty three appears to be among the warmest at least a hundred thousand years. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1907.78s)]
*  Quote, there were simply no cities, no books, agriculture or domesticated animals on this [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1913.06s)]
*  planet the last time the temperature was so high. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1919.3s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1923.54s)]
*  We are at the point almost we're at it that scientists warned us about the point where [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1925.1399999999999s)]
*  we had hope to cap warming at this limit that we're at. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1929.86s)]
*  And this year is likely to be even hotter. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1933.94s)]
*  Now, this is obviously terrifying and sort of panic inducing. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1936.8999999999999s)]
*  But I will say there's another piece of climate news. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1940.74s)]
*  Twenty twenty three was the hottest year on record, but it was also the first year [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1944.1s)]
*  since the pandemic that U.S. emissions declined while the economy grew. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1946.9s)]
*  You can see GDP growth in green emissions in blue on this chart over there on the right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1952.5800000000002s)]
*  That's twenty twenty three. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1957.8600000000001s)]
*  One goes up, one goes down. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1958.74s)]
*  That's what you want to see. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1960.26s)]
*  And even better, last year's emissions were two percent below what was expected based on the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1963.0600000000002s)]
*  baseline rate of decline between twenty eleven and twenty nineteen, meaning we're [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1968.42s)]
*  declining faster. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1972.3400000000001s)]
*  According to analysts, it suggests an acceleration in the pace of American [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1973.38s)]
*  decarbonization. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1977.7800000000002s)]
*  It is, I will caution, still not enough to meet our emissions targets under the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1979.0600000000002s)]
*  pyrus climate accords. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1982.8200000000002s)]
*  But we're heading in the right direction and maybe getting better at doing it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1984.3400000000001s)]
*  That shift in emissions is part of what I got the chance to explore on my podcast, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1988.98s)]
*  Why is this Happening?, which you can find by scanning the QR code you see there on your [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1993.46s)]
*  screen. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1997.7s)]
*  In this week's episode, I spoke with one of my favorite climate journalists, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=1998.9s)]
*  Robinson Meyer. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2002.5s)]
*  He's founder of a great climate publication called Heatmap about the year and climate, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2003.54s)]
*  the recent inflection points on emissions, the future of clean energy. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2007.86s)]
*  Here's a part of that conversation. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2011.14s)]
*  Over the past ten years in the U.S., we used to think the power sector was really, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2013.7s)]
*  really hard. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2018.82s)]
*  The power sector was the biggest source of emissions in the U.S. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2020.18s)]
*  Then cheap wind and solar happened and very rapidly and we switched, frankly, from cold [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2024.34s)]
*  and natural gas through a lot of the country and very rapidly power sector emissions fell. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2028.9s)]
*  Then the big world of climate people started looking at transportation and then EV prices [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2033.0600000000002s)]
*  fell. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2040.26s)]
*  Transportation became the most polluting sector of the U.S. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2042.42s)]
*  economy. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2045.7800000000002s)]
*  But what's about to happen in the next few years is that transportation is going to fall [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2046.5s)]
*  to second place and industry will be the most polluting sector of the economy. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2054.02s)]
*  What I suspect will happen is that just as happened with the power sector, just as happened [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2059.2200000000003s)]
*  with the transportation sector, once industry is the most polluting sector of the economy and [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2063.86s)]
*  people really start to focus on it, we're going to see all these easy to obeyed emissions that we [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2068.58s)]
*  just haven't really noticed yet. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2074.02s)]
*  We're going to get rid of them really quickly. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2076.6600000000003s)]
*  That is optimistic and it's really important on this topic to resist doom. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2078.58s)]

*  We are now awaiting a decision any day, any moment from the D.C. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2093.78s)]
*  Court of Appeals on whether Donald Trump is immune, as he claims, from criminal charges [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2096.82s)]
*  for attempting to overturn the election. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2100.9s)]
*  Yesterday's hearing on this, the three judges in the panel certainly seem skeptical. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2103.3s)]
*  Conservative attorney George Conway, who was in that courtroom, points out that Trump's lawyers [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2108.02s)]
*  had a difficult case to begin with because their position is clearly not correct under either [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2112.9s)]
*  precedent or the Constitution, but in making the arguments they had, they also fell into a trap. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2117.38s)]
*  It happened when one judge, Florence Pan, pressed Trump's lawyers on the implications of his argument. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2123.0600000000004s)]
*  In response to that moment, Conway writes, quote, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2142.9s)]
*  The damage was done and Pan's point was devastatingly made. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2145.0600000000004s)]
*  On the one hand, Trump's lawyer argued the Constitution gave the president [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2148.7400000000002s)]
*  absolute immunity for his official acts. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2152.42s)]
*  On the other hand, if the United States Congress effectively gives permission by impeaching and [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2154.26s)]
*  convicting, well then yes, a president can be prosecuted and wait for it. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2158.1000000000004s)]
*  He's not absolutely immune. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2161.7000000000003s)]
*  George Conway joins me now. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2164.26s)]
*  He's a contributing writer for The Atlantic. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2165.5400000000004s)]
*  I found your argument here interesting. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2168.02s)]
*  It didn't dawn on me in the same way that it did to you, that moment. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2172.98s)]
*  I want you to explain why that, and Judge Pan was very focused on it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2177.14s)]
*  She kept coming at it again and again and again. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2181.54s)]
*  Why that moment was so important for Trump's argument collapsing? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2184.8199999999997s)]
*  There are a couple reasons for that. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2193.06s)]
*  First of all, Judge Pan was trying to do two things, as I see it. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2194.34s)]
*  One was she was trying to elicit a concession from Trump's counsel that his position was extreme. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2199.06s)]
*  At the same time, when Trump's counsel resisted saying that yes, a president is absolutely immune [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2208.02s)]
*  for sending in SEAL Team 6, she then went to the underbelly of the argument that he was making as [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2215.62s)]
*  to why it wasn't always the case, which was this argument based upon the secondary [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2226.82s)]
*  provision that Trump relies on, which is the impeachment judgment clause, which says that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2232.42s)]
*  you can prosecute somebody criminally after you impeach and remove them through Congress. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2238.66s)]
*  Her point really was that there was a tension between those two positions. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2245.54s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the position he was taking was extreme under one clause, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2249.3s)]
*  the second clause, the second provision, which is the impeachment judgment provision, basically [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2254.02s)]
*  undercuts the absolute immunity claim because it makes clear that officeholders, and it doesn't [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2260.34s)]
*  exclude the president, can be prosecuted after being removed from office. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2265.62s)]
*  And so she kept drilling on that, and then she makes the point that, okay, well, if you're saying [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2270.26s)]
*  that he can be prosecuted under some circumstances when Congress does impeach and convict and remove [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2276.1800000000003s)]
*  a president, you're not saying he's absolutely immune. And so that's the reason why Trump's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2283.1400000000003s)]
*  position collapsed was it was not only was it extreme, but it was at war with itself. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2290.5s)]
*  And when you get that kind of—and the other thing that made it worse for Trump's lawyer is, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2299.78s)]
*  when you're going to have to make a concession to a judge who is very smart and is not going to let [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2305.86s)]
*  things go, you make the concession. You say, yes, that's—I mean, because it is their position [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2311.94s)]
*  that a president who's not impeached and removed can get away with anything. It has to be their [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2317.78s)]
*  position because there's not much worse, other than perhaps sending SEAL Team 6 to the Capitol, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  than what he did. So sometimes you just have to accept the fact that your position is out there [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2328.02s)]
*  because it's the only one you can take. Now, it's a loser, to be sure, but you do not make a weak [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2334.74s)]
*  argument stronger by blending it with an even weaker one. That is appellate advocacy 101, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2340.5s)]
*  in addition to answer the questions. So that's such an interesting and, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2347.06s)]
*  I think, really important point. I just want to stay with it for a second because I think it's [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2351.14s)]
*  key. I mean, the opening bid, right, from Trump's lawyers is he is absolutely immune [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2354.02s)]
*  for official acts at the outer perimeter of his official duties. And that means anything from [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2359.14s)]
*  sending SEAL Team 6 as Jack Smith's office, I think, smartly sort of raised to selling pardons. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2365.06s)]
*  These are clearly, we would say, criminal enterprises, but they intermix with official [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2370.1s)]
*  acts. And what you're saying is, rather—what they realized, I think, is that that was too extreme, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2375.62s)]
*  and they needed a fallback. So they concocted this sort of, you know, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2380.98s)]
*  fecacca— Fecacca is a good word, yes. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2386.9s)]
*  Fecacca, Rube Goldberg— Michigan also would be a good word, too. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2389.3s)]
*  —construction, which is like this weird impeachment thing. And you're saying by constructing [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2392.58s)]
*  the fallback so that you're not making the extreme argument, you're also undercutting [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2398.26s)]
*  the clarity of the argument itself. That's exactly right. And it goes even [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2402.82s)]
*  beyond the fact that it's—that the impeachment judgment clause is inconsistent with [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2406.74s)]
*  absolute presidential criminal immunity. Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2414.2599999999998s)]
*  The rationales that he was presenting were inconsistent. His rationale that he kept [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2417.14s)]
*  repeating to the panel, Sauer, Trump's lawyer, he kept saying, the reason why we have to have [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2424.2599999999998s)]
*  absolute criminal immunity is because of the specter that some other president—his client, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2432.18s)]
*  actually—might go and start prosecuting, engaging in political prosecutions to punish his enemies. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2438.66s)]
*  Okay, well, that's—okay, that's not a crazy argument. We don't want political prosecutions [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2445.46s)]
*  of politicians for simply doing their jobs. On the other hand, the argument that he said that, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2450.5s)]
*  well, you can prosecute a president when the Congress of the United States says you can. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2456.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2462.82s)]
*  And excuse me, that's the most political spot in the universe. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2463.06s)]
*  Right there. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2468.34s)]
*  Right. Exactly. Right. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2468.9s)]
*  I mean, come on. So his argument is rendered— [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2470.1s)]
*  His argument is rendered, yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2473.38s)]
*  —may no sense on many levels. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2473.54s)]
*  Yeah. That is a really, really excellent point. I was very— [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2474.58s)]
*  And thank you for the backdrop. It really helped. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2477.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Well, we can't—George Conway, who was in that room, who himself [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD3jK_ZltA8&t=2478.98s)]
