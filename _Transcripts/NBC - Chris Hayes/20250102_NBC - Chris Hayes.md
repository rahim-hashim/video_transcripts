# Sen. Sherrod Brown on his ‘mission’ after leaving the Senate
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA)
*  There's an open question right now, a debate that's interesting to me, as to how Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=0.0s)]
*  are going to approach governing this time around with Donald Trump as president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=4.28s)]
*  Back in 2016, Trump's win was seen, I think, by a lot of folks as a fluke since he lost [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=9.0s)]
*  the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, only won the Electoral College. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=13.34s)]
*  And I think that sense that he was, in a fundamental sense, not small d democratically elected, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  that helped fuel the Trump resistance movement. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Democrats pushed back against his policies, like for instance, mobilizing everyone, every [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=27.78s)]
*  Democrat in the Senate, against his attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  resulted in him getting voted out of office, ultimately. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=36.58s)]
*  So how are Democrats going to approach things this time around? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=41.06s)]
*  Well, it's been kind of a different tune. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=43.7s)]
*  Just yesterday, first day of the New York, Congressman Tom Swasey, who's a moderate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=45.7s)]
*  Democrat from New York in a district that Trump has carried, published an op-ed in the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=49.22s)]
*  of trying something different with Trump, writing, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=54.42s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who served as a Senator from that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=67.42s)]
*  state for nearly 20 years, including the four years when Trump first served as president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=71.92s)]
*  It's good to have you on, Senator. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=75.92s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=76.92s)]
*  Good to be back, Chris. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=77.92s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=78.92s)]
*  I'm very curious to hear your perspective on this question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=79.92s)]
*  You're someone that I think has navigated, you know, holding pretty fast your principles [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=83.18s)]
*  and representing a state that was moving to the right for much of your career, your three [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=89.18s)]
*  terms, lost this last election again by considerably less than Kamala Harris at the top of the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=94.18s)]
*  ticket did. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=100.18s)]
*  How do you think about this sort of question about compromise, finding common ground versus [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=101.18s)]
*  resistance? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=106.18s)]
*  Well, my post-Senate mission is how do we make the Democrats the party of workers again? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=107.18s)]
*  And we have drifted away from that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=113.18s)]
*  And I would argue that ever since NAFTA, and I heard I still heard talk about NAFTA in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=115.18s)]
*  Mahoning Valley in this campaign, that the area where the drop was most precipitous from [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=121.18s)]
*  10 years ago to now for Democrats. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=126.18s)]
*  And, you know, the Democrats, the worker, we've got to become the party of workers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=129.18s)]
*  And I think one of the places to start, just I believe a month, roughly a month ago in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=133.18s)]
*  early December, Trump appointed judge in East Texas, struck down an overtime rule, which [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=138.18s)]
*  ultimately one judge making one decision struck down on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=144.18s)]
*  of the state of Texas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=150.18s)]
*  Four million American workers will lose their overtime. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=152.18s)]
*  Workers that are making 30, 35, 40,000 a year told by management to work more than 40 hours, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=155.18s)]
*  classified by management and by the company as management. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=162.18s)]
*  They will have to work 10 or 15 extra hours with no overtime. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=166.18s)]
*  Democrats ought to be leading the charge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=169.18s)]
*  I mean, we did that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=171.18s)]
*  The Biden administration did it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=172.18s)]
*  I pushed them for years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=174.18s)]
*  Obama kind of started it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=175.18s)]
*  But we need to make fights on behalf of workers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=177.18s)]
*  We have to show that we're for workers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=180.18s)]
*  It means, and I'm not giving advice to former colleagues, but it means, you know, walk and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=182.18s)]
*  picket lines, helping with organizing drives, going to union halls, not just union halls, but [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=187.18s)]
*  not just union workers, of course, workers across the board. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=191.18s)]
*  And whether you work in a nursing home, whether you work at McDonald's or whether you're a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=194.18s)]
*  steel worker, whether you're building Intel in Columbus or fixing a highway, all workers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=198.18s)]
*  And we've got to stand for them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=204.18s)]
*  I mean, we don't look like that party anymore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=206.18s)]
*  We're too bi-coastal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=208.18s)]
*  We're too corporate in the minds of far too many people across the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=209.18s)]
*  Let me add, let's stay on this because this is something I thought about a lot. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=213.18s)]
*  I mean, I think it's fair to say that this administration, the Biden administration, was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=216.18s)]
*  one of the most sort of labor friendly and pro-worker, I think the most that I've ever [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=220.18s)]
*  covered in my career. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=225.18s)]
*  That NLRB that issued some of those overtime rules, issued a lot of pro-worker rulings, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=227.18s)]
*  particularly on things like organizing and overtime. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=233.18s)]
*  It didn't seem like anyone knew that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=235.18s)]
*  And I guess my question to you is, what is your theory for why that is? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=239.18s)]
*  Having just campaigned around a state where there are people who maybe are cross-pressured in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=242.18s)]
*  their politics, you know, maybe they have visions of who the Democrats are and they're not like us [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=246.18s)]
*  or they stand for us, like, how do you understand how people know about whether Democrats or the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=251.18s)]
*  Biden administration are fighting for them? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=259.18s)]
*  Well, we need to be more aggressive. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=261.18s)]
*  We need to do it right then. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=263.18s)]
*  I was talking to a number of union leaders, union activists, both during the campaign and after. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=264.18s)]
*  And when we passed, we fixed the pensions of 100,000 union workers in Ohio, a million union workers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=269.18s)]
*  across the country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=277.18s)]
*  President Biden is going to sign a bill tomorrow that I wrote with Senator Collins of Maine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=279.18s)]
*  This one was bipartisan, the other one wasn't, that will restore full Social Security benefits to a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=283.18s)]
*  quarter million Ohioans, millions across the country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=288.18s)]
*  We need to talk about those things when we do them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=291.18s)]
*  Democrats, because we believe government can make people's lives better, we pass something and we [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=294.18s)]
*  move on to the next thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=299.18s)]
*  But unions talk to their workers, their members right away when we save their pensions or when we're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=301.18s)]
*  working or going after Republicans on the protecting the right to organize Republicans, you know, are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=307.18s)]
*  probably more anti. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=313.18s)]
*  They became more and more, they like to talk about workers and more and more they're the party of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=314.18s)]
*  billionaires. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=319.18s)]
*  Look at the cabinet, the proposed cabinet, look at the people from whom President Trump gets, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=320.18s)]
*  President-elect President Trump gets his advice. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=325.18s)]
*  They're more and more the billionaire party. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=327.18s)]
*  So we need to point that out and point it out every day. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=329.18s)]
*  The best example is what they're going to do in February, March when they ram through the biggest tax [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=332.18s)]
*  break for the richest Americans in history. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=338.18s)]
*  That's not what the public didn't want that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=340.18s)]
*  Even people that voted for Trump, they're not, they don't want big rich people to get bigger and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=343.18s)]
*  richer tax cuts. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=348.18s)]
*  Then we talk about the child tax credit. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=349.18s)]
*  We talk about the kinds of things we should be doing to stand with workers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=351.18s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to do it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=357.18s)]
*  I said I think the overtime rule is maybe the most poignant and the most immediate and affects again [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=359.18s)]
*  four million workers who are going to be away from their families, working hard, making $35,000 a year, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=364.18s)]
*  working those extra 10 or 20 hours with no pay is just morally repugnant. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=370.18s)]
*  And voters will understand that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=375.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=377.18s)]
*  I mean, that's a great point that you can highlight that fight or not if you're Democrats. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=378.18s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts on this sort of weird meme org that is the Department of Government [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=382.18s)]
*  Efficiency that Musk and Ramaswamy are running, which isn't real. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=391.18s)]
*  It's not part of the government, but it's there and it appears to have a lot of influence. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=396.18s)]
*  And there are Democrats saying, oh, yeah, there's lots of wasteful government fund spending that we [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=400.18s)]
*  should talk about and defense contractors. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=405.18s)]
*  And I personally think that's a bit of a trap. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=407.18s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=409.18s)]
*  Well, I'm not paying a lot of attention to it, frankly, because I'm working on how do we bring work and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=411.18s)]
*  become the party of workers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=416.18s)]
*  I almost smile because you know these three egos in the room, Trump and the guy from Ohio whose name I'm [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=418.18s)]
*  forgetting now and Musk are going to butt heads and they all three think they're president, I think. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=426.18s)]
*  But that's more amusing than anything else. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=432.18s)]
*  But we can't play their game. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=435.18s)]
*  We've got to make the sharp distinction. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=437.18s)]
*  Sure, there's waste in government. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=439.18s)]
*  We talk about it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=441.18s)]
*  But there are far too many cases where this government, proposed government, they're going to stand with the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=443.18s)]
*  rich against Medicare. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=449.18s)]
*  They're going to stand with the rich against Medicaid. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=451.18s)]
*  They're going to stand with the rich against Social Security. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=453.18s)]
*  They're going to stand with the rich when it comes to their tax cuts. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=455.18s)]
*  Make that argument. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=457.18s)]
*  Sure, they're going to come up with some interesting things when an institution is big as that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=459.18s)]
*  And they want to privatize Social Security. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=463.18s)]
*  I saw them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=465.18s)]
*  We saved a veterans hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio from Trump closing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=467.18s)]
*  They want to privatize the VA. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=471.18s)]
*  So they want to privatize prisons, Social Security, Medicare, and the VA. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=473.18s)]
*  And we've got to make those arguments. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=477.18s)]
*  This is more money in their pockets instead of standing with workers and fighting for those workers that work at [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=479.18s)]
*  those places and are delivering services to the public. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=485.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're already making noises about how Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are not off the table. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=487.18s)]
*  And they're going to be considered. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=491.18s)]
*  And if they're going to cut $2 trillion, that seems to me like a disaster for them politically. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=493.18s)]
*  But we'll see how that fight develops. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=497.18s)]
*  One thing we need to make clear, too, Chris, I know time's running out, is most voters are going to be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=499.18s)]
*  They don't see who's liberal, who's conservative. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=503.18s)]
*  They see who side you on. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=505.18s)]
*  And we've got to wake up every day, those in office and those of us outside who once were in office and maybe in the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=507.18s)]
*  future or whatever, but are just activists, an important part of our party. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  We've got to make sure that we make the distinction who's on our side. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  And we make that on the tax bill. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=521.1800000000001s)]
*  We make it on the overtime rule. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  We make it on trade agreements. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  We make it on the tax bill. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  We make it on the price of prescription drugs. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=529.18s)]
*  We win when we do that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=531.18s)]
*  Senator Sherry Brown, thank you very much for your time tonight, sir. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=533.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrxvQM8vwA&t=559.18s)]
