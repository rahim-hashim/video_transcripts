# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 9  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=0.0s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=3.5s)]
*  History inside a D.C. courtroom. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=7.8s)]
*  I ask you a yes or no question. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=10.0s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=19.12s)]
*  The indicted ex-president claims complete immunity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  I believe I said qualified yes if he's impeached and convicted first. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=27.0s)]
*  And Trump's criminal attorney is confronted with Trump's impeachment defense. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=30.0s)]
*  After he's out of office, you go and arrest him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=35.0s)]
*  Tonight, the arguments, the implications, and the timetable for a Republican frontrunner [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=38.0s)]
*  running to stay out of jail. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=44.0s)]
*  Plus, stunning new evidence of the ongoing coup as we learn of herring new threats to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=46.0s)]
*  Trump's prosecutor and judge. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=51.0s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=53.0s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=60.0s)]
*  History made in front of the entire country today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=61.0s)]
*  At least we could all hear it if not see it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=63.0s)]
*  Less than one week before the Iowa caucus, the man who's poised to win the Republican [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=66.0s)]
*  nomination sat in court while his lawyers attempted a last-minute effort to get the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=70.0s)]
*  ex-president's criminal charges thrown out on immunity grounds. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=75.0s)]
*  In Donald Trump's federal election interference trial, one of the last chances to hold him [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=80.0s)]
*  accountable for the crimes of January 6th before the upcoming election, his lawyers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=84.0s)]
*  stood before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, probably the second most important court in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=89.0s)]
*  all the land, and before the nation and those three judges argued that a president can effectively [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=94.0s)]
*  do whatever he wants, no matter how malevolent, without any legal consequences. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=99.0s)]
*  To authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=107.0s)]
*  box from which this nation may never recover. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=113.0s)]
*  So can I explore sort of the implications of what you're arguing? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=116.0s)]
*  I understand your position to be that a president is immune from criminal prosecution for any [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=121.0s)]
*  official act that he takes as president, even if that action is taken for an unlawful or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=127.0s)]
*  unconstitutional purpose. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=133.0s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=135.0s)]
*  With an important exception, which is that if the president is impeached and convicted [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=136.0s)]
*  by the United States Senate in a, you know, proceeding that reflects widespread political [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=140.0s)]
*  consensus. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=146.0s)]
*  Okay, so there you have it, in case you weren't tracking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=147.0s)]
*  So the official position of Donald Trump is that as long as he or any president can hold [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=150.0s)]
*  on to 35 votes in the Senate to avoid an impeachment conviction, there can be no, as a matter of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=157.0s)]
*  constitutional bedrock American law, there can be no criminal accountability for anything [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=164.0s)]
*  he does, no matter how violent or evil. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=170.0s)]
*  Even as his lawyer was forced to concede having his political opponents murdered. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=174.0s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=180.0s)]
*  That's an official act in order to seal Team Six? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=185.0s)]
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=188.0s)]
*  But if you weren't, there would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=194.0s)]
*  Chief Justice's opinion on Marlborough against Madison and our Constitutional tradition and the plain language of the impeachment [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=199.0s)]
*  judgment clause all clearly presuppose that what the founders were concerned about was not... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=207.0s)]
*  I asked you a yes or no question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=212.0s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=215.0s)]
*  would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=221.0s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=224.0s)]
*  So your answer is no. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=227.0s)]
*  My answer is qualified yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=229.0s)]
*  There is a political process that would have to occur under the structure of our Constitution, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=231.0s)]
*  which would require impeachment and conviction by the Senate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=234.0s)]
*  Again, all you got to do is hold on to 35 votes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=237.0s)]
*  You hold on to 35 votes in the Senate and you can have your political opponents murdered. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=241.0s)]
*  You can have anyone murdered. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=245.0s)]
*  You could do whatever you want. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=247.0s)]
*  You got 35 votes in the Senate and there is nothing anyone can do anywhere in this country under the structure, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=248.0s)]
*  they say, of the Constitution. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=256.0s)]
*  They are not trying to hide it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=257.0s)]
*  Trump's argument is some of the most breathtaking, aggressive public articulation of a vision of American dictatorship as we have ever seen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=260.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=269.0s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious, but it's worth stressing this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=271.0s)]
*  This was not being made in a fundraising email by like a low level staffer, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=274.0s)]
*  It was not an off the cuff answer on a tarmac. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=279.0s)]
*  It was not a campaign speech at a rally where he goes off the teleprompter playing to the crowd. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=282.0s)]
*  This was the considered argument of the lawyer for the man who wants to wield the office of the presidency again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=287.0s)]
*  Thankfully, three judges seemed appropriately skeptical of Trump's arguments. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=296.0s)]
*  All of your other arguments seem to fall away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=303.0s)]
*  Your separation of powers arguments fall away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=306.0s)]
*  Your policy arguments fall away if you concede that a president can be criminally prosecuted under some circumstances. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=308.0s)]
*  Even under Clinton, where there's a deal cut under President Nixon, where there's a pardon given, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=315.0s)]
*  there's an assumption that you could be prosecuted because why enter into those particular acts? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=323.0s)]
*  I think it's paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=328.0s)]
*  Yes, Judge, respectfully, I agree. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=344.0s)]
*  I do think it's paradoxical. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=347.0s)]
*  Now, the lawyer for special counsel Jack Smith's office did an admirable job both outlining how ridiculous the ever shifting legal argument from Trump is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=349.0s)]
*  and also, again, to reiterate the very dire consequences that could follow from this preposterous theory of presidential immunity if adopted. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=357.0s)]
*  The defendant's theory over the course of this litigation has evolved a bit, and I think now before this court, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=367.0s)]
*  I understand the arguments to be principally sort of the principle submission to be, as you've just described, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=374.0s)]
*  this what we call in our brief the conditioned precedent argument that there is only liability, criminal liability, for a former president if that president has been impeached and convicted. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=380.0s)]
*  And that is wrong for textual, structural, historical reasons and a host of practical ones, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=391.0s)]
*  one of which I'll start with again to just amplify the point. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=400.0s)]
*  It would mean that if a former president engages in assassination, selling pardons, these kinds of things, and then isn't impeached and convicted, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=403.0s)]
*  there is no accountability for that individual, and that is frightening. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=415.0s)]
*  The lawyer from Smith's office also noted that while the criminal prosecution of a former president is unprecedented, so were Trump's crimes against American democracy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=420.0s)]
*  Never before has there been allegations that a sitting president has, with private individuals and using the levers of power, sought to fundamentally subvert the Democratic Republic and the electoral system. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=430.0s)]
*  And frankly, if that kind of fact pattern arises again, I think it would be awfully scary if there weren't some sort of mechanism by which to reach that criminally. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=443.0s)]
*  And if you're listening to this as a non-lawyer, or even if you're a lawyer who's not particularly immersed in constitutional law and the sort of line of cases about presidential immunity, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=453.0s)]
*  I mean, just at a lay level, just as a citizen to citizen kind of thing, as fellow members of this Democratic polity, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=462.0s)]
*  it just seems obviously the case that there has to be some kind of legal accountability, the possibility of it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=469.0s)]
*  I mean, if a former president who tried to steal an election is running for the White House again to finish the job, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=477.0s)]
*  what self-respecting republic wouldn't have a way of defending itself against an enemy such as that? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=485.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, Donald Trump was sitting there the entire time, glowering, according to reporters in the room, the ex-president looking dour, scribbling notes to his lawyers with a sharpie during the prosecution's presentation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=491.0s)]
*  And it sounds like his message got through to them because towards the end of the same proceedings, we heard some particularly Trumpian arguments from his attorney when responding to the plain truth put forward by Jackson's team. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=502.0s)]
*  The floodgates will be open. We are in a situation where we have the prosecution of the chief political opponent who is winning in every poll, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=521.0s)]
*  a presidential election upcoming next year and is being prosecuted by the administration that he's seeking to replace. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=529.0s)]
*  That is the frightening future. That is tailor-made to launch cycles of recrimination that will shake our republic for the future. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=535.0s)]
*  Just a really classic Trumpian propagandistic lie right there, casually winning in every poll, said sort of almost as a stipulated aside that no one can rebut. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=541.0s)]
*  Clearly comes directly from Trump. That is the kind of thing the boss wants to hear. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=550.0s)]
*  And he sits there while three judges weigh his potential freedom. And the entire argument from his legal team, all of it today, was just about as chilling a warning as to what is at stake in this election as anything we've encountered thus far, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=555.0s)]
*  which is saying something save for the actual bloody spectacle of January 6th. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=568.0s)]
*  Today's arguments were clearly a test. They felt like that in the moment. You could feel it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=573.0s)]
*  Like, is this going to hold? Are the guardrails of our democracy still in place? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=578.0s)]
*  Or is Trump going to be allowed to become the dictator he's always dreamed of being free from any legal accountability for his actions? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=584.0s)]
*  Everyone in that room today, a hazard to say, understood that fact. Everyone listening at home should as well. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=592.0s)]
*  Ryan Reilly is an NBC News justice reporter who is inside that courtroom today. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=599.0s)]
*  Harry Lippman, a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice. He also serves as a law clerk at that very same D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals at her arguments today. They joined me now. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=605.0s)]
*  Ryan, let me just start with you for what the atmosphere on the scene was like inside that courtroom. Very few people allowed in there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=614.0s)]
*  We all got to hear it. We didn't get to see it. What did you see? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=620.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for one, Donald Trump reacted the most. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=624.0s)]
*  I think he had the most enthusiasm when his lawyer said winning in every poll. That was a poll. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=628.0s)]
*  That was when you sort of see a really big head nod from Donald Trump. That was what got him really excited during his actual counsel's initial argument. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=633.0s)]
*  He was pretty much just sitting there and listening. I think, you know, a lot of the legalese and citations kind of went over his head. Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=640.0s)]
*  But in terms of the argument, what he was interested in, he got really interested when the special counsel was making their arguments and was writing those notes you mentioned on a yellow legal pad, sort of scribbling things down and passing them over to his lawyer. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=647.0s)]
*  And it seems like you're right that the message sort of got through there on the other end because his lawyer made some really sort of stark political points that were a little bit, you know, out of sort of context, I think, for the argument that they were sort of making. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=659.0s)]
*  It was just those those lines that he essentially wanted to get in. And then, you know, you also just look at this logistically. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=671.0s)]
*  Right. Donald Trump wanted this to be an event. In fact, you know, they had to go somewhere else to hold this press conference because the courtroom here isn't really a courthouse rather isn't really a great place for you to hold these press conferences because there's this whole security mechanism. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=676.0s)]
*  You go in through the basement. You can't really just pop outside the Secret Service wouldn't love that if you did. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=688.0s)]
*  So they had to set up a separate location just so he can get sort of the TV time so he can get that clip that you're going to show on the news, I guess. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=694.0s)]
*  Right. That's what he actually wanted out of this. But he wanted to get those those lines in from his lawyer and then have that press conference afterwards to sort of get his media event in here, Chris. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=701.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should note he basically threatened some sort of unrest or bedlam. If the things didn't go his way, he didn't take any any questions. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=709.0s)]
*  Harry, I want to talk about the to me, the sort of headline here, which for those clips we played and the headline comes from a hypo, you know, a hypothetical that appears in Jack Smith's own briefs. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=716.0s)]
*  Right. Which is to say the argument that Trump and his lawyers are making proves too much obviously goes too far. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=727.0s)]
*  It cannot be the case under the Constitution and under the rule of law that a liberal democracy such as ours would allow it to be possible to order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival and not face accountability but for some impeachment and conviction. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=735.0s)]
*  Cannot be. That is the headline. All three judges will reject that proposition. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=752.0s)]
*  Basically, after Judge Pan asked that hypo about SEAL Team Six, Sauer, Trump's lawyer, was a dead man walking. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=757.0s)]
*  He's going to lose. He should lose. The basic distinction doesn't isn't cogent legally, historically, logically, et cetera. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=764.0s)]
*  So in that sense, there's the satisfaction that this vampire of a claim will finally have a stake in its heart. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=773.0s)]
*  But below the headline, Chris, there's a little bit more drama, I would say, because this was one of the cases in which the three judges were kind of probing different theories at one stage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=780.0s)]
*  Judge Henderson said maybe we need to remand to ask Judge Chuck in this. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=792.0s)]
*  They had they were probing different ideas, none of which was in lockstep with what Chuck and said. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=797.0s)]
*  And the reason that matters, there's two reasons it matters. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=802.0s)]
*  Depending on how they decide, even if they are unanimous and you could see a sort of concurrence here from Judge Henderson. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=805.0s)]
*  But even if they're unanimous, it could really affect the prospects for a remand. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=812.0s)]
*  And a remand might entail a subsequent round of appeals under the remanded standard. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=817.0s)]
*  By Trump and a little bit more delay. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=823.0s)]
*  It also could affect whether the Supreme Court takes review. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=826.0s)]
*  So that lower level, there is there was some drama and I think people were basically not confident about the way in which the panel the panel will reject his claim. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=830.0s)]
*  They'll do it quickly. The exact rationale is a little bit uncertain, I'd say. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=841.0s)]
*  Yeah. And just to be clear on the text on the remand, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah. And just to be clear on the text on the remand, remand is when an appellate court sends it back down one level and they say we're going to put these we want you to reassess this issue. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=850.0s)]
*  But with these sort of parameters and you heard Jack Smith's attorney say, no, no, no, no, that's a terrible idea. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=860.0s)]
*  Let's not open that can of worms. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=866.0s)]
*  Like if we should you guys should affirm and then let's get on with the trial. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=868.0s)]
*  And if he's got appeals, he makes them after judgment, just like everyone else. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=873.0s)]
*  Let's let's not do all this stuff before trial. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=877.0s)]
*  Exactly. And there's even an argument that someone made that they don't have jurisdiction to do it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=881.0s)]
*  And all three of them were intrigued with that argument, but it also didn't seem to get over the top. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=887.0s)]
*  So again, we'll learn the answer to this question quickly. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=892.0s)]
*  They will decide it, I think, within a week or so. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=895.0s)]
*  But there are scenarios where if he then after it sent back down and she decides under the announced standard what the results should be, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=898.0s)]
*  he may have another run at some kind of delay. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=908.0s)]
*  And of course, that's that's always primary. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=912.0s)]
*  Second, of course, being the lousy legal arguments that he's propounding. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=916.0s)]
*  How did you think the lawyers did today? Just just in terms of their lawyer? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I thought soured. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=925.0s)]
*  He he he stood up and said what he needed to. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=928.0s)]
*  But I think he chose a very bad line and you showed him at his worst just then. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=932.0s)]
*  A judge asked you a yes or no question. You say yes or no. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=936.0s)]
*  Nothing drives under distraction more. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=940.0s)]
*  And I thought Pierce for his for his part. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=942.0s)]
*  And it was interesting to a lot of observers that it wasn't Michael Dreeben. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=946.0s)]
*  Pierce was fine. He argued for half the time. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=949.0s)]
*  Literally, they were all over sour for twice as much time. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=952.0s)]
*  And I think he was sentence by sentence. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=957.0s)]
*  OK, but in his overall strategy and sweep, he did a poor job. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=960.0s)]
*  Interesting. Ryan Riley, Harry Lippman. Thank you both. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=964.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. All right. Coming up, we're going to take a deeper dive into the most ridiculous arguments that Trump's lawyers made today. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=967.0s)]
*  And later, the very real danger that judges, prosecutors, anyone else who stands against Trump or even independent of him finds themselves in. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=973.0s)]
*  That's a hat. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=981.0s)]
*  So I think the strangest argument that Donald Trump's lawyer kept making today was this notion that somehow a president who is not impeached and convicted by the Senate cannot be prosecuted. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=984.0s)]
*  Now, I got to say, as far as I can tell, this is an argument they appeared to have basically invented whole cloth in the last like 24 hours. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=995.0s)]
*  And you can hear the skepticism from the judges. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1003.0s)]
*  I've asked you a series of hypotheticals about criminal actions that could be taken by a president and could be considered official acts and asked you, would such a president be subject to criminal prosecution if he's not impeached or convicted? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1007.0s)]
*  And your answer, your yes or no answer is no. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1024.0s)]
*  I believe I said qualified yes if he's impeached or convicted first. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1027.0s)]
*  My question was, OK, so he's not impeached or convicted. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1031.0s)]
*  Let me put that aside. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1034.0s)]
*  You're saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1036.0s)]
*  OK, so the argument, you're trying, the argument that Trump's lawyer came back to time and time again was that the only way that you could, under the Constitution, prosecute a hypothetical president for doing all those hypothetical crimes would be if first, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1045.0s)]
*  while he was president, he was impeached and convicted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1060.0s)]
*  Now, there are a bunch of reasons why the argument is ludicrous, not the least of which is that when the ex-president was being impeached the second time, one of the arguments made for acquittal was that impeachment wasn't the right venue. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1065.0s)]
*  Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell argued at length it wasn't the Senate's job to hold Trump accountable. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1078.0s)]
*  That's what prosecutors in courts are for. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1084.0s)]
*  President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1088.0s)]
*  Didn't get away with anything yet. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1092.0s)]
*  We have a criminal justice system in this country. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1094.0s)]
*  We have civil litigation. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1098.0s)]
*  And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1100.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is a former litigator, now an MSNBC legal analyst. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1106.0s)]
*  Charles Coleman prosecuted civil cases on behalf of the U.S. government. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1109.0s)]
*  He's now a civil rights and criminal defense attorney. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1112.0s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1114.0s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1115.0s)]
*  Okay, first, just give me your first read on the centrality of this argument. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1116.0s)]
*  The you have to impeach and convict first argument as it appeared today, which I was not anticipating to be as central as it was. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1122.0s)]
*  Well, that's because it's not their first line argument, right? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1129.0s)]
*  The argument that they're making on presidential immunity starts with the overarching he's immune from everything because of the structure of the Constitution and separation of powers principles. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1131.0s)]
*  This was their sort of like second line, correct? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1142.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1146.0s)]
*  The impeachment judgment clause of Article One of the Constitution, which is really intended to be a limit on the Senate. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1147.0s)]
*  And essentially what it says is if you impeach and convict someone, the penalties that you can impose upon them are disqualification from holding office and removal from office and nothing further. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1154.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, nothing should prevent that person from also being liable in a court of law. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1165.0s)]
*  There is nothing in that text that says anything about what avenues of relief are open, for example, to the Department of Justice, which is not addressed in Article One. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1170.0s)]
*  This is meant as a constraint on Congress, not a get out of jail free card for a former president. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1180.0s)]
*  And in that way, Chris, they sort of back their way into this argument. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1186.0s)]
*  I could very much so. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1190.0s)]
*  It was like, oh, now I'm here. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1191.0s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1193.0s)]
*  Because as Lisa said, this is a clause in the Constitution that is supposed to limit Congress, limit the Senate, not give the president more power. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1194.0s)]
*  However, one of the things that I had found so interesting about this entire ordeal was I've been wondering going into today, where are they going to create an actual constitutional question that could potentially make its way to the high court? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1203.0s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1217.0s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1218.0s)]
*  I was I was looking to see whether in pushing on the separation of powers issue, they would create enough controversy that it might pose a legitimate question for the Supreme Court. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1219.0s)]
*  I don't think that they did that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1229.0s)]
*  So here's what I think a very smart lawyer I talked to about this today made this point, which which was clarifying for me because I was like, what's up with all the impeachment stuff? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1230.0s)]
*  And she said, look, it's a fallback position, right? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1238.0s)]
*  Because what they actually want to argue, what they've argued in the briefs is you can't do anything. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1240.0s)]
*  Right. If it's an official act, tough, tough luck, buddy, which means if he sells SEAL Team 6 to go assassinate his political rival. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1245.0s)]
*  Now, they couldn't argue because it's so ludicrous. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1253.0s)]
*  So now they've got this this fallback impeachment position. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1258.0s)]
*  I just want to it's just worth playing because this is a classic Trump thing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1260.0s)]
*  Like in one venue, the argument is like, well, this is the venue. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1265.0s)]
*  And then the then you go to the other venue like, well, that's not the it's not the venue now. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1268.0s)]
*  Right. They love to do this. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1272.0s)]
*  Here's Trump's lawyer during impeachment, assuring the senators, look, if this doesn't if this if you go to vote for convict, he can of course go get arrested and get convicted. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1273.0s)]
*  Take a listen. If my colleagues on this side of the chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense and let's understand a high crime is a felony and a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1284.0s)]
*  The words haven't changed that much over the time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1298.0s)]
*  After he's out of office, you go and arrest him. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1300.0s)]
*  There is no such thing as a January exception to impeachment. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1305.0s)]
*  There is only the text of the Constitution, which makes very clear that a former president is subject to criminal sanction after his presidency for any illegal acts he commits. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1310.0s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's lawyer at the impeachment hearing, making literally the opposite argument that his lawyer made today before these judges. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1324.0s)]
*  Yes. And one of the reasons it's also specious is because this impeachment judgment clause, it doesn't just apply to presidents. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1332.0s)]
*  It applies to anybody who could be impeached by the House and Senate. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1339.0s)]
*  That means former federal judges, for example, or cabinet secretaries. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1343.0s)]
*  Some of those people have been prosecuted and convicted without impeachment. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1347.0s)]
*  Hello, Henry Cisneros, the former HUD secretary. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1351.0s)]
*  And there are a litany of federal judges who have been prosecuted and convicted either without impeachment or before they're impeached. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1354.0s)]
*  So Trump's lawyers had to have known that during the impeachment debacle that you just showed there. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1361.0s)]
*  They understand full well that the impeachment judgment clause isn't just about the president. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1367.0s)]
*  And those real life examples show why it can't possibly be victorious here. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1371.0s)]
*  I guess the question for you, right? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1376.0s)]
*  I thought when the impeachment thing showed up in the brief, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1378.0s)]
*  So in their brief, they had this again. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1381.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a little like taking a shot from 36 feet. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1383.0s)]
*  Like, you know, if you hit it, great. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1385.0s)]
*  But like, you got to try, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1387.0s)]
*  So it's like they have this thing about like it's double jeopardy because he was always already impeached and wasn't convicted. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1389.0s)]
*  And so criminal trial. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1394.0s)]
*  And that's like that's sort of fallen by the wayside a little bit. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1395.0s)]
*  But they've refashioned it. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1397.0s)]
*  I guess my feeling was like, are they trying to come up with something novel enough that SCOTUS will take it? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1399.0s)]
*  I think it's so out of nowhere. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1404.0s)]
*  This entire ordeal around impeachment, this entire question, this entire appeal is the shot from 36 feet. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1406.0s)]
*  It's actually the half court shot. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1412.0s)]
*  Really, like if it goes in at any point for any reason, you take it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1415.0s)]
*  You take it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1419.0s)]
*  And I think that the more that you can jam pack into that, you may get a line. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1420.0s)]
*  It might be what we refer to as dicta in an opinion that you try to sort of ride. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1424.0s)]
*  And dicta is something that a judge might say that's not necessarily germane to the case, but is part of a decision. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1428.0s)]
*  They're looking for something that they can hang their hat on some door, some avenue, some crack that they're going to be able to open that's controversial enough that they feel like it's going to generate a legitimate question for another appeal for more delay. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1433.0s)]
*  OK, can I ask you a quick question on timing that Harry teased, right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1446.0s)]
*  There's a back and forth about the possibility of some sort of remand. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1450.0s)]
*  What did you make of that? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1454.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's because in the civil context, this same court recently decided an appeal with respect to three cases brought by former police officers, members of Congress who have sued Trump civilly. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1456.0s)]
*  And in that case, in fact, you know, the civil rule is that a president does have immunity within the outer perimeter of his official duties. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1468.0s)]
*  Because of that, they sent it back to the lower court to determine, well, what was he doing here? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1476.0s)]
*  Was he acting in his official capacity or some personal capacity? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1481.0s)]
*  That makes sense where you're talking about the civil rule. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1485.0s)]
*  But here the court has to fashion a rule in the first place. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1488.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1490.0s)]
*  Judge Chuckin's lower court decision says there is no criminal immunity of any kind. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1491.0s)]
*  So it's unclear whether they'll need to remand at all. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1496.0s)]
*  And they're supposed to take these facts as true. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1499.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1501.0s)]
*  Charles Coleman, Lisa Rubin. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1502.0s)]
*  That was great. Thank you both. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1503.0s)]
*  Still to come, the Republican front owner all but admits he will attempt to overthrow the government if he loses again. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1504.0s)]
*  Unmistakable new evidence and what it means ahead. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1509.0s)]
*  For Donald Trump and his allies, the insurrection never ended. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1517.0s)]
*  In fact, they are still plotting it out in the open right now. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1520.0s)]
*  That was clear today as we listen to the ex-presidents lawyers argue in federal court in favor of an unaccountable dictatorship and violent suppression of dissent. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1523.0s)]
*  It was chilling. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1533.0s)]
*  It goes far beyond Trump and his inner circle. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1534.0s)]
*  According to a new poll, a majority of Republicans would describe the actions of the January 6 rioters as patriotism. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1537.0s)]
*  Fifty nine percent would describe their actions as defending freedom. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1543.0s)]
*  Two thirds of Republicans would support pardoning the insurrectionists. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1547.0s)]
*  Just this weekend, the number three Republican in the House leadership, Elise Stefanik of New York, talked about the insurrectionists as they were martyrs for the MAGA cause. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1551.0s)]
*  I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1561.0s)]
*  I have concerns. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1566.0s)]
*  We have a role in Congress of oversight over our treatments of prisoners. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1567.0s)]
*  And I believe that we're seeing the weaponization of the federal government against not just President Trump, but we're seeing it against conservatives. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1571.0s)]
*  Hostages. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1579.0s)]
*  She referred to them as hostages, like comparing them to the men, women and children being held by Hamas. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1580.0s)]
*  That's how she is comparing the U.S. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1586.0s)]
*  government's prosecution under due process of people that violated the law. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1589.0s)]
*  The congresswoman also refused to commit to accept the outcome of the next election. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1594.0s)]
*  What about 2024? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1599.0s)]
*  What about 2024? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1601.0s)]
*  We will see if this is a legal and valid election. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1602.0s)]
*  I don't hear you committed to certifying the election results. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1605.0s)]
*  Will you only commit to certify the results if their president Trump wins? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1608.0s)]
*  Does that mean the former president Trump wins? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1612.0s)]
*  No, it means if they are constitutional. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1614.0s)]
*  What we saw in 2020 was unconstitutional circumventing of the Constitution. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1615.0s)]
*  It was not unconstitutional circumventing of the Constitution. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1621.0s)]
*  There were 63 court cases that went up to every single level of the judiciary declaring that wasn't the case. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1626.0s)]
*  That's invented. That's part of the big lie. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1633.0s)]
*  It's kind of the big lie by Harvard grads, you might say. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1635.0s)]
*  Of course, Stefanik did not come up with any of that on her own. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1639.0s)]
*  He's parroting Donald Trump, who told us the same thing before the 2020 election and once again called for the release of the charge and convicted insurrectionist this weekend. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1642.0s)]
*  They're saying all this out in the open for millions to hear. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1651.0s)]
*  We've got new evidence suggesting it's a well thought out plan. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1654.0s)]
*  They've thought about it. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1657.0s)]
*  Last week when Donald Trump filed his paperwork to appear on the ballot in Illinois, he refused to sign the state's loyalty oath, which states that he would not advocate for overthrowing the government. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1658.0s)]
*  He signed it in 2016-2020, so it's not some clerical error, but he didn't sign it this time. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1669.0s)]
*  Trump is telling us exactly what he plans to do. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1676.0s)]
*  If he loses the election this year, he will try to overthrow the government and Elise Stefanik is likely to help. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1679.0s)]
*  Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that he does not think there's any political cost to declaring it openly. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1685.0s)]
*  What recent history shows about whether Donald Trump can actually win when he's running to be a dictator. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1691.0s)]
*  Next. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1696.0s)]
*  While Donald Trump's hearing today in federal court was, of course, a legal proceeding with legal arguments, it was also a political argument from a candidate trying to win an election. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1699.0s)]
*  At one point, the ex-president's lawyer even alluded to his client's oft repeated claim that his prosecution is politically motivated. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1707.0s)]
*  I think that that has no basis in the context of the current prosecution where the current incumbent of presidency is prosecuting his number one political opponent and his greatest electoral threat. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1715.0s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump has already lost the popular vote twice. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1727.0s)]
*  Voters rejected his anti-democratic agenda in the 2022 midterms quite forcefully. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1730.0s)]
*  You think that might temper his rhetoric, but instead the ex-president still claims he's above the law. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1735.0s)]
*  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic senator of Missouri, Tim Miller, former RNC spokesman, now writer-at-large to the Bullwork, and they join me now. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1741.0s)]
*  Claire, I was struck today that whatever you thought of the legal argumentation, which I thought was fairly preposterous and outlandish, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1748.0s)]
*  you know, saying, yeah, you biting the bullet and saying, yeah, you know, as long as he's not impeached, the president could assassinate his political rivals using the U.S. armed forces. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1755.0s)]
*  Like, you would think you wouldn't want to make that argument in purely political terms. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1764.0s)]
*  And I think they just think there's nothing they could say on these terms that's going to hurt them politically. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1769.0s)]
*  I think you're right. I think Donald Trump believes these court cases are helping him. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1774.0s)]
*  I think he sees them as a campaign tool. And give me a minute here, OK? Just give me a minute. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1780.0s)]
*  This guy that represented Trump today is from Missouri, OK? And he's Harvard. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1785.0s)]
*  He clerked for Ludig, Chris. He clerked for the conservative judge that is advancing the plain text of the Constitution supporting that the 14th Amendment should remove Donald Trump from the ballot. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1791.0s)]
*  He clerked for Scalia. And by the way, Elise Stefanik, who is now saying, yeah, who cares about the rule of law, I'm just going to make up stuff and the rule of law doesn't matter. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1805.0s)]
*  She's a Harvard grad. So I've got a newsflash for everybody out there. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1815.0s)]
*  Harvard is failing in brainwashing all their students in some kind of progressive mindset because half the tools that are running around Washington right now, whether it's Cruz or Hawley or Stefanik or this guy that was in court today, are Harvard educated. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1819.0s)]
*  So or Yale, Harvard or Yale. So I mean, it really kind of blows up this theory that there is some kind of like vast conspiracy to have all the Ivy League schools turn out woke robots. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1836.0s)]
*  But it's on its face, knowing what impeachment is like, knowing what the process is. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1848.0s)]
*  It's a political process. It's not a court of law. Anybody who thinks impeachment must be necessary to enforce the criminal law in this country does not understand the Constitution and the role of checks and balances and the role the judiciary is supposed to play in the United States of America. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1856.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's also I think your point, Claire, that he thinks it's helping him. I think there's a pretty colorable argument to him. It is in the primary, right? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1872.0s)]
*  I do think that's totally possible. Although, you know, there's some new polling that shows Nikki Haley within seven points in New Hampshire, where again, unaffiliated voters are allowed. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1880.0s)]
*  It's an open primary. They can vote. But I don't know. I mean, again, you can start to lose your mind in the times that we're in. You start to get kind of like a sort of like seaborne vertigo where you sort of lose the horizon, which I often feel. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1889.0s)]
*  But, you know, 78% of Americans disapprove of January 6. We did have a test of this in the 2022 midterms. I'm still sticking to my Occam's razor belief that like trying to overthrow the U.S. government is not popular and not good politics. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1904.0s)]
*  And the more time and attention spent on it, the worse for the likely Republican nominee. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1918.0s)]
*  I agree with that. And I think that that likely is how he would end up pivoting come, you know, the last couple months. The election. I think the other thing Donald Trump knows is the short attention span of the American news consumer. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1924.0s)]
*  I think we have a lot of people who are already entrenched in one side or the other. And the other folks, you know, a lot of the Wall Street Journal reading Republicans that he's going to need in the end, they're going to forget the crazy stuff that he [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1936.0s)]
*  He's bleeding out in January of this year. And so I feel like he thinks that he can make this tough fight as long as he's in this primary. It's clearly helping him in the primary, though. I do understand your vote ago. I had it when you were shown one of the polls in the lead in about how, you know, 50 some odd percent of Republicans think the January 6 participants are great patriots. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1947.0s)]
*  I also I also thought that it was a fed up, so I don't understand how they could be victims of a fed up and also great patriots at the same time. That's a little confusing. And so I think that there's not a lot of logic sometimes to understanding what's happening in the Republican polls. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1966.0s)]
*  But I think that there's no legitimate, you know, statistical based argument that this is not helping him with Republican voters. But in the end of the day, the people that are going to decide this election, the handful of working class Obama Trump voters that by trying to win back in the handful of college educated Wall Street Journal reading, as I said, suburban Romney Biden voters. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=1982.0s)]
*  You know, for to that crowd to either of those groups, I do not think that, you know, talking about how the as president, he would have the right to assassinate his political opponents is going to be a big winner. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2006.0s)]
*  Do you think and I'm asking this honestly, because I don't know the answer and you're a practitioner, Claire, and I'm not. But like, is there political hate to be made out of that? Like, Donald Trump thinks you can assassinate the political rival SEAL Team Six and like skate? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2015.0s)]
*  Like, I just it's such a it's such a monstrous sort of idea. And obviously, it's not his hypo. It's Jack Smith's hypo. But they put the bullet on it today. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2029.0s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely put the bullet on it. And it is an unbelievable hypothetical that they refuse to reject. And they could have found a way to reject it. But they have very little to argue here. And so they're clinging to this. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2038.0s)]
*  I got to tell you, I think a lot of people are numb. I mean, this is a guy who said he's going to terminate the Constitution. He's going to terminate the Constitution. He's going to execute people that are high in the military that don't do what he says. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2053.0s)]
*  He's going to shut down news outlets. He's going to prosecute journalists. He's going to seek retribution on everyone. And now we find out that he truly believes through his lawyers that he can commit any crime as long as he has 35 senators and in Congress, it'll back him up. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2066.0s)]
*  It's so perfect, Tim, as the in the polarized times we're in, right, the dictatorship of 35 votes, right? Like it's the perfect vision of this moment of politics. Like, yeah, if you can hold 35 votes, which you could do for anything like you could do whatever you want. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2085.0s)]
*  And we've seen that he can literally have a new thesis in the 30th. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2101.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2105.0s)]
*  Have met have definitely met. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2106.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2108.0s)]
*  In our current year of 2023. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2109.0s)]
*  Claire McCaskill and Tim Miller, thank you both. Appreciate it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2110.0s)]
*  Still ahead, two separate attacks on the prosecutor and the federal judge overseeing the trial of Donald Trump. It is a really big deal. This is happening. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2113.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about what happened next. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2121.0s)]
*  There's a form of Internet Internet age terrorism, for lack of a better word, that is taking place more and more in this country, particularly against perceived foes of Donald Trump. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2124.0s)]
*  They can anonymously call 911 to report a completely false dangerous situation, such as, for instance, an active shooter. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2137.0s)]
*  Right. And the 911 911 dispatcher talks to the police and the police rushed to the location, often with a SWAT team who are armed to the hilt and prepared for violence. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2146.0s)]
*  And they burst onto the scene with guns drawn, endangering the lives of entirely innocent, unsuspecting people. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2155.0s)]
*  It has come to be known as swatting and people have died from it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2161.0s)]
*  In Wichita, Kansas, police killed a 28 year old man when he opened his door after getting a fake call that someone was killed and there was a man armed man holding hostages. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2166.0s)]
*  In Tennessee, a 60 year old grandfather died of a heart attack when another one of these hoax swatting calls led police to his home with guns drawn. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2177.0s)]
*  And now two of the most prominent figures in the prosecution of Donald Trump, the judge overseeing his federal election interference case, Tonya Chukhin and special counsel Jack Smith, have been arrested. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2185.0s)]
*  And special counsel Jack Smith have been targets of this swatting. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2194.0s)]
*  On Sunday night, police and fire trucks showed up at the home of Judge Chukhin in response to a false report of a shooting that was called in. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2198.0s)]
*  On Christmas Day, it happened to Jack Smith when someone called 911 and said that he had shot his wife. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2206.0s)]
*  Police were on their way to Smith's home when US Marshals, who were protecting Smith and his family, told police it was a false alarm that everyone inside the home was safe. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2214.0s)]
*  So luckily, no one was hurt in either incident. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2223.0s)]
*  But even if everyone's safe, this type of targeting results in a certainty of intense disruption to lives and not only the individuals involved, but their entire families. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2226.0s)]
*  And that's the point. That is the point. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2236.0s)]
*  The MAGA movement has used threats of violence and the possibility of danger as a key tool of anti-democratic coercion. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2238.0s)]
*  LaDoris Cordell served as a judge for 19 years, including 13 on the Superior Court of California. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2246.0s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2252.0s)]
*  Judge Cordell, first, just your reaction to these news stories, which came one after another about each of these figures receiving this kind of intimidation. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2253.0s)]
*  Well, Chris, first of all, swatting is the act of a coward. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2262.0s)]
*  It is a federal crime, punishable five years to life, and it's a crime in some of the states. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2266.0s)]
*  But last year, Chief Justice Roberts gave his year end address as report, and in it he addressed the fear that judges face today. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2272.0s)]
*  And one of the things he said is a judicial system cannot and should not live in fear. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2280.0s)]
*  And he's right, of course, because the cardinal rule of judging is to rule without fear or favor. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2285.0s)]
*  But fear today, it's the new normal for judges in America. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2291.0s)]
*  So when a judge issues a decision, and it doesn't even have to be controversial, but if it's a decision that someone doesn't like, then judges have targets on their robes. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2296.0s)]
*  So when the judge's fear of the mob is greater than the judge's commitment to upholding the Constitution, judicial independence disappears and democracy goes with it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2306.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump's statements politicizing the courts and attacking judges, it's no longer dog whistles to the MAGA base. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2316.0s)]
*  It's bull horns to the MAGA base. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2325.0s)]
*  And they are the direct drivers, the key drivers of this violent rhetoric and this violent conduct. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2328.0s)]
*  Yeah, that point you made, I mean, there's a certain amount of this that is part of being a judge, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2335.0s)]
*  If you are a judge, you are going to rule in ways that parties are not going to like. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2340.0s)]
*  And in the criminal context, you will rule in ways that people who may have a violent background or may be part of an organized crime syndicate, right, are not going to like. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2346.0s)]
*  So there is that as a sort of baseline. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2354.0s)]
*  That's a scary aspect of the profession. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2357.0s)]
*  But in this case, you have the most famous person in the country, more or less, with the most sort of rabid fan base repeatedly and specifically targeting you if you're Jack Smith or Judge Schuch. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2360.0s)]
*  Right. And what Trump is doing is neither patriotic nor mature. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2373.0s)]
*  He is neither of these things. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2380.0s)]
*  And what he's doing is inciting the base because he wants judges to be intimidated. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2382.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2387.0s)]
*  And all I can do and all of us can do is hope and pray that judges who take that oath to uphold the Constitution and all of the laws will continue to do so and not be intimidated by this rhetoric and also this violence. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2388.0s)]
*  And by the way, social media is not helping because that platform is really kind of enabling some of this rhetoric to get out there. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2402.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me let me just read this is from the political article on increased spending on security for Jack Smith's team. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2410.0s)]
*  And I suspect there are similar things happening for judges that are involved in any of these cases. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2415.0s)]
*  Security costs for special counsel Jack Smith have risen dramatically in recent months, with nearly a third of the expenses on his investigations being security related over the latest reporting period. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2420.0s)]
*  The increase comes as a special counsel's alleged in court papers that Trump's frequent rhetorical attacks have sparked threats to his team. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2430.0s)]
*  We know about threats that have come into the New York officers at the court. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2437.0s)]
*  And one of the things I love to hear your thoughts on is there's the threat of violence and something like swatting can really, as we showed, can go wrong. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2443.0s)]
*  But then there's also just the hassle. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2452.0s)]
*  Like, this is Christmas Day with your family. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2455.0s)]
*  You've got security now. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2457.0s)]
*  You're going to the grocery store. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2458.0s)]
*  Your entire life is going to change under these circumstances. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2460.0s)]
*  Chris, these are the times in which we live. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2464.0s)]
*  And I say this very sadly when I was on the bench, I occasionally very rarely got threats, but we didn't have the social media to help promote any of this. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2466.0s)]
*  So these are the times in which we live. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2475.0s)]
*  And yes, security is going to have to be beefed up sadly. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2477.0s)]
*  And the hope is, again, that we are supportive of our judiciary and its independence. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2481.0s)]
*  That's really the key to all of this. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2488.0s)]
*  We don't want these judges to look over their shoulders or put their fingers to the wind before making decisions. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2489.0s)]
*  They have to rule on what's happening in the courtroom and not out there. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2495.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is the sort of sacrosanct and solemn duty of judges everywhere, including anyone involving these cases. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2499.0s)]
*  Ladoors Cordell, who knows well about what that entails. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2506.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2510.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8uLDqlRt7M&t=2511.0s)]
