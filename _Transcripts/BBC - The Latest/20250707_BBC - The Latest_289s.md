**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI)
*  The number of people killed by flash floods that have devastated parts of central Texas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=0.0s)]
*  has risen to 80, including at least 28 children. A massive search continues for dozens of people, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=5.44s)]
*  including 10 girls who were among hundreds at a summer camp when the flood waters hit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=11.92s)]
*  The Guadalupe River burst its banks during heavy rains northwest of San Antonio. President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=17.36s)]
*  Trump, who set to visit this area later this week, has signed a major disaster declaration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=23.44s)]
*  for the affected counties where more heavy rain is forecast. From the scene, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=29.28s)]
*  our chief North America correspondent, Gary O'Donoghue, has sent us this report. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Now into the fourth day of this search and rescue effort and the death toll continues to rise [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  inexorably. Emergency services and volunteers have been out by the camps ever since the flood water [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=48.0s)]
*  hit, walking the trails looking for the missing girls. So I'm just across the river now from Camp [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=54.96s)]
*  Mystic and you can see where the recreation hall had its whole front wall torn away. There are still [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=61.04s)]
*  some rescue workers over there sifting through the debris because there are still some of the girls [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=66.48s)]
*  missing but as time passes now well beyond 48 hours after the flooding, hope of finding anyone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=72.56s)]
*  alive is significantly diminishing. Debris still scatters the huts at Camp Mystic where the girls [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=78.48s)]
*  were staying for the Independence Day holiday weekend. There are parents who still do not know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=86.48s)]
*  where their children are like Michael. We got here and started looking and the game warden showed up [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  we went as far as we could downstream [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=101.2s)]
*  um but we don't have the equipment for that so we're letting them do that and and then we're [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  looking for places that they're going to potentially be alive. More than 800 people have already been [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=112.4s)]
*  rescued in the past days though many did not make it. Conditions continue to be challenging for the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=119.12s)]
*  rescue teams with more warnings about further rain and potential flooding. Local officials say [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  they're doing everything they can. And it was nothing short of horrific to see what those young [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=132.16s)]
*  children went through and we will remain 100 percent dedicated searching for every single one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=138.64s)]
*  of the children who were at Camp Mystic as well as anybody else and the entire riverbed to make [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=146.24s)]
*  sure that they're going to be recovered. The president has expressed his condolences for the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=153.28s)]
*  families of those who have lost their lives and may visit Texas later in the week. If you look at [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=157.76s)]
*  that that what a situation that all is and that was really the Biden setup that was not our setup [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=163.2s)]
*  but I wouldn't blame Biden for it either. I would just say this is a hundred year catastrophe [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=169.44s)]
*  and it's just so horrible to watch. Are you planning to visit Texas Mr. President? Probably on Friday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=176.88s)]
*  We want to leave a little time. I would have done it today but we'd just be in their way [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  probably Friday. This tragedy is far from over and while this devastated community continues to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  come to terms with its loss it's also starting to ask questions about how it could have been [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=196.08s)]
*  caught so off guard by this torrential flood. Gary O'Donoghue reporting there. Well Kathy Clark is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  assistant director for the emergency disaster services of the Salvation Army in Texas and she [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=209.52s)]
*  spoke to us about what's being done to help those affected. Central Texas experienced historic deadly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=215.68s)]
*  flash flooding. Ten inches of rain fell in under 12 hours causing the Guadalupe River to rise 23 feet [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=223.68s)]
*  you know in less than an hour. There's camps and neighborhoods were hit so hard and we still can't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=233.12s)]
*  get into some of these areas and like you mentioned there's so many lives that have lost [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=240.16s)]
*  80 lives and including children and some are still missing. The Salvation Army we mobilized [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=246.0s)]
*  within hours. Our Kerrville Croc Center deployed its mobile feeding unit to the original reunification [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  center. There's several of these set up all over the cities that were affected. We're serving at [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=259.6s)]
*  the City West Church where first responders are stationed and we're doing this on a 24-7 basis. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  Since Friday the Salvation Army we've served 2,600 hot meals. We've passed out 16,000 drinks cold [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1dL7bQsNCI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
