*  The surviving miners claimed they couldn't escape after the police sealed some of the exits and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=46.16s)]
*  tried to force them out by limiting the supply of food and water. The BBC has confirmed that more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=51.04s)]

*  Workers from Save the Children South Africa translated interviews for some of the underage [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=69.6s)]

*  through because some of them saw others being sexually exploited you know just the feeling that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=82.32s)]

*  Reports of abuse are not limited to Stilfontaine. Men who worked in two other illegal mines have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  told the BBC they witnessed child abuse underground. Tsepo is a former illegal miner. We've protected [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=102.32s)]

*  them underground against their will. And can you tell me what impact this abuse had on the children? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=114.64s)]
*  They change their behaviour pattern and have trust issues. They no longer want you to get any closer [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=121.67999999999999s)]

*  Jonathan worked in another mine near Johannesburg. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=134.16s)]
*  Sometimes I used to see kids entering mining so they used to take advantage of them sometimes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=137.52s)]
*  How old were these kids? 15, 17. And what was being done to them? Sexual abuse whenever they get a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=144.4s)]

*  trafficked from poor families in neighbouring countries and promised employment in formal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=171.68s)]

*  like these everywhere. But declining prices has led to the closure of thousands of formal mines [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qkN1vAI5pI&t=189.44s)]
