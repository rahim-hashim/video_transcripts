# 'I hope the pope will make a positive change in the world'. #Pope #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik)
*  Well, it's a very exciting news because it's the first American pope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=0.0s)]
*  I think Americans will be very excited. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  We feel excited that he's American. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=8.4s)]
*  I'm ecstatic. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Excited and hopeful. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=10.8s)]
*  In Italy, everybody thought it would be an Italian pope, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=12.6s)]
*  but it was not, so it's okay anyway. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  What do we want the new pope to do? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  To bring peace, for sure, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=25.2s)]
*  because we really need peace. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=28.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think peace is the first thing to try to do, yes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=30.8s)]
*  In his papal address, he mentioned peace, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=35.6s)]
*  and I think there's a lot of power to be said in that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=38.4s)]
*  We need peace more than ever in this time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=41.6s)]
*  I want him to continue Pope Francis' legacy of kindness towards everyone, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=45.0s)]
*  especially towards the minorities and those in persecution and LGBTQ. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=50.0s)]
*  I think he really has the responsibility to spread those progressive ideas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=53.8s)]
*  and kindness as well as he can. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=57.4s)]
*  I hope he continues to be the voice of the unheard. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  I hope he will actually make a positive change in the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbOhY_Fxik&t=65.6s)]
