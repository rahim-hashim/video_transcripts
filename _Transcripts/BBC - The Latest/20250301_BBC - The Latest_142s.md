# How Streaming is revolutionising Bollywood | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA)
*  Streaming services have changed the way films are traditionally produced and consumed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=0.0s)]
*  and Bollywood, the largest film industry in the world, is no exception. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=5.0s)]
*  My colleague Ritika Gupta sat down with the film's producer and movie icon, Amir Khan, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=9.0s)]
*  to discuss how streaming services are revolutionising Indian cinema for a global audience. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=14.0s)]
*  I was a jury in a script competition and that's when I came across the script, which I really loved. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=23.0s)]
*  I was like, you know, this film has to be made. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=27.0s)]
*  And it really touched me in many ways. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=30.0s)]
*  I found it, I mean, the kind of issues it picks, women's issues, but it brings it out in so much humour. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=34.0s)]
*  And it has also a theme of males aligning with some of the issues. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=43.0s)]
*  So a lot of people say that the Hollywood model is dying. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=50.0s)]
*  Big budgets, big movies, big film stars, and that that is because of streaming and that streaming is the future. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=55.0s)]
*  Would you say that that is the same case for Bollywood? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=61.0s)]
*  That group experience of watching a film in a theatre is very unique and I think that that's, I'd be very surprised if that dies out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=64.0s)]
*  I also feel that ultimately, you know, each platform has its own advantages and you know, you have to choose as a creative person [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=71.0s)]
*  which platform you want to use for which material. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=77.0s)]
*  I think one of the main advantages is being on an OTT platform like Netflix, you know, gives you a world audience to watch your film. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=80.0s)]
*  That's one of the big advantages. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=87.0s)]
*  Your film gets a much wider exposure, potentially, if it's a good film. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=89.0s)]
*  Theatrically, you have to release each country separately, but if you're on Netflix, it's all over on the same day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=93.0s)]
*  I think human beings have changed since the smartphone has come in. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=103.0s)]
*  Our ability to focus on any one thing has reduced and I think that is the challenge that filmmakers are facing all over the world today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=106.0s)]
*  And Aamir, you know, I love the soundtrack for this film and I know you have a very lovely voice, so can you sing us something? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZZEDZHTcMA&t=113.0s)]
