Video Description: The Trump administration has moved to end Harvard's ability to enrol international students, escalating a standoff with America's oldest university.
 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration had revoked Harvard's "Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law."
 
"Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country," she wrote on X on Thursday.
Harvard called the move "unlawful" in a statement.
 
Over 6,700 international students were enrolled at the institution last academic year, university data shows, making up 27% of its student body.

# US President Trump blocks Harvard from enrolling foreign students | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w)
*  Next, the US government says it's blocking the prestigious Harvard University from enrolling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=0.0s)]
*  foreign students with immediate effect. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=5.48s)]
*  Well Harvard relies heavily on fees from overseas students and those currently studying there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  will now have to transfer elsewhere. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=12.1s)]
*  The White House has accused the institution of fostering violence and anti-Semitism and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=14.68s)]
*  says the university isn't doing enough to limit the power students have on campus. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=19.56s)]
*  Harvard on the other hand says the government's acting illegally. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=24.84s)]
*  The US Homeland Security Secretary is Kristi Noem and she told Fox News why the government's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=27.9s)]
*  targeting Harvard. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=32.14s)]
*  They have promoted and allowed violent activity on campus. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  They have allowed anti-Semitism participation with CCP and Chinese infiltration and influence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=38.62s)]
*  on their campus and they haven't protected their students. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=46.9s)]
*  So we have given them multiple opportunities to share criminal activity with us, backgrounds [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=50.12s)]
*  on these students, to let us conduct the oversight into this program that is our responsibility [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=55.78s)]
*  and they have refused to do so. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=60.64s)]
*  Well our senior North America correspondent John Sudworth has more background on the story. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=63.36s)]
*  Well almost from the moment of his inauguration Donald Trump began pressuring America's elite [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=69.9s)]
*  universities over what he saw as woke ideology in their teaching and anti-Semitism on their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  campuses in particular over their handling of pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=83.08s)]
*  Harvard though was the first to really push back against some of that pressure, launching [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  legal action over a decision to freeze some two billion dollars of its federal grants [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=94.72s)]
*  and refusing to comply with the suggestion that it ought to alter its curriculum and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=101.08s)]
*  its hiring practices. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=106.78s)]
*  Now the administration has clearly doubled down, halting Harvard's ability to enroll [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=108.76s)]
*  international students. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=115.0s)]
*  You make up a quarter of its 24,000 strong student body and of course bring in a significant [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=116.4s)]
*  amount of income. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=123.44s)]
*  In a letter to Harvard the Homeland Security Secretary Christine Ohm said this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=125.62s)]
*  She said that Harvard had been fostering violence, anti-Semitism and coordinating with the Chinese [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=131.56s)]
*  Communist Party. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=139.32s)]
*  It's unclear what this means for students who are currently enrolled and here on visas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=141.2s)]
*  The suggestion is that they may have to leave the United States unless they can find alternative [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  courses with other universities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  But Harvard in its response said this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  It called the decision unlawful and it says it threatens serious harm not only to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=161.0s)]
*  university but to the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  And it seems likely, many people suggest, that there will be further legal action over [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=168.24s)]
*  this decision and so the fate of existing students may be now with the US courts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfzYx0OT7w&t=173.60000000000002s)]
