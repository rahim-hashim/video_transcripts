# Could Kingdom Come Deliverance II have the longest script in gaming history? #KCDII #Gaming #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s)
*  They're actually speaking to the Guinness Book of World Records about various things, including the size of the script, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=0.0s)]
*  which they think it's the longest script written in gaming history, so I think somebody said something like 2.2 million words. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=4.64s)]
*  I play the character that the player plays as, so anything that they could possibly say in this open world RPG has to be recorded. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  So somebody did a count up and they said there was something like 38,000 lines that I'd done just on the main body of the game before DRC. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=16.16s)]
*  It was like commuting to a regular job. I would go on a Sunday night, I'd work Monday to Friday, I'd do eight-hour sessions, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=22.96s)]
*  because we realised that most of the actors were doing four-hour sessions, but the only way to get through that volume of material was for me to do eight hours. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=28.8s)]
*  And it kind of became this, yeah, this insane marathon of talking. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NcrR8xSs4s&t=36.4s)]
