Video Description: US President Donald Trump has condemned Russia's overnight attack on Ukraine, saying "I am not happy" and it was "very bad timing".
 
The strikes, which killed at least eight in Kyiv and injured 77 more, were earlier branded "difficult" and "impudent" by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 
Speaking on a cut-short visit to South Africa, Zelensky said "more pressure" must be put on Russia to achieve a ceasefire between the two countries.
