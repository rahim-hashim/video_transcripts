Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said that Iran has “reached out” and “wants to negotiate” with the US when speaking to reporters outside the White House.
 
Trump dismissed any questions from reporters about US involvement in Iran, saying: “I may do it, I may not do it. Nobody knows what I want to do. But I can say this: Iran's got a lot of trouble and wants to negotiate."
 
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier warned that any US military action “will be met with irreparable harm”, and added that Iran would not surrender.

*  can't say whether the US will strike Iran he said they had bad intentions over [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=443.0s)]
*  40 years I don't know how much longer it's going to go on he also said that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=449.48s)]

*  negotiate but then made the point that negotiations had already lasted 60 days [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=459.04s)]
*  on date 61 they hit and interesting there was a line in the middle there [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=463.96s)]

*  to help mediate and he said mediate your own war the war on Ukraine and that was [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=475.68s)]
*  interesting because the president faced criticism when he first posted that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=480.6s)]
*  Vladimir Putin had often to mediate this particular crisis in the Middle East he [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=484.6s)]

*  social media earlier in the day talking about what that actually meant talking [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  about the type of flagpoles but all the key questions really being asked about [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=612.52s)]
*  the Middle East conflict one of the answers he said they are totally [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  defenseless they have no air defenses whatsoever I'm making the point there is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  a big difference between now and a week ago of course it was Friday when the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=624.52s)]
*  conflict really started the first strikes from Israel well we'll come away [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=629.48s)]
*  he will continue I assume to take a few more questions but if there's anything [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=634.24s)]
*  significant we'll obviously return to that let's just recap where we are as [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=638.36s)]
*  you join us here on verified live because Iran's supreme leader earlier in [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=643.72s)]

*  involved in Israel's military campaign against Tehran it is understood [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=652.8s)]
*  President Trump is considering joining the attacks on Iran's nuclear sites in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=657.52s)]
*  the last half an hour or so Israel's defense minister has said the Air Force [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  jets had destroyed Iran's internal security headquarters today of course is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  day six of this rapidly escalating crisis well let's talk to our [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  correspondents in a moment we'll be in Jerusalem with irony wells but let's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  talk first to our North America correspondent Nomiya Iqbal and Nomiya he [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=680.0s)]
*  was asked questions about his and you heard the answers but today or tomorrow [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=684.16s)]
*  is very much decision time for the president isn't it it is but to be honest [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  we didn't really get any clarity from him whatsoever he claims that the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  Iranians have reached out to him but saying it's too late to talk which is [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=700.56s)]
*  interesting considering that Donald Trump is always saying that he wants to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=704.76s)]
*  make a deal wants to negotiate he's also saying that the Iranians want to come [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  to the White House you know we don't know if that is in case what the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  Iranians want to do but the world is waiting to see what President Trump is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=716.0s)]
*  going to do there are reports here that the administration is leaning towards [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=721.12s)]
*  involvement rather than diplomacy and that would involve sending US troops to [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=727.0s)]
*  the region with those bunker buster bombs to destroy Iran's nuclear [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=732.92s)]
*  capabilities deep underground but make no mistake if that is indeed what Donald [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=737.32s)]
*  Trump does it will be a defining moment in his presidency a seismic moment in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=742.88s)]
*  his presidency remember this is the man who has long campaigned for no wars no [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=749.76s)]
*  foreign intervention he did so back in May in Saudi Arabia so in the end the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  era of foreign intervention is over and I'm just looking at some of his old [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=759.84s)]
*  tweets this one from back in 2013 where he says remember I predicted a long time [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=763.08s)]
*  ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=768.72s)]
*  negotiate properly not skilled and he's also other tweets from the past in which [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  he's criticized Obama accusing him of trying to start a war with Iran and now [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=778.4s)]
*  we're in a position where Donald Trump isn't really saying which way he's going [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=782.72s)]
*  to go and that really does confound his base his MAGA base who largely elected [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=786.84s)]
*  him on his platform of no wars so we'll see we don't know what the US plans to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=793.04s)]
*  do we're nowhere closer to understanding it following that press [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  conference by by the president. Nomiya we will leave it there for now we have a [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=803.7199999999999s)]
*  busy hour so we will talk again in the coming hours Nomiya Iqbal there in [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=808.76s)]
*  Washington let's go to Jerusalem Ioni Wells is there and Ioni are you hearing [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=813.0s)]
*  any sort of clues from the Netanyahu government about suggesting whether the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=817.88s)]
*  US are going to join with Israel and also reflect for us on where the public [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=823.72s)]
*  mood is given what we've seen over the last six days? Well the main update we've [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=828.88s)]
*  had from the Israeli government today is the defense minister Israel Katz [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=835.28s)]
*  saying that they are now going to gradually reopen the economy including [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=839.76s)]
*  opening for example workplaces but also allowing gatherings again calling this a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=844.2s)]
*  victory over Iran now this suggests that the government is feeling more confident [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  about what it has achieved so far we know that they've been targeting for [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=854.12s)]
*  example Iran's military capacities its missile capacities in particular but [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=858.2800000000001s)]
*  he added that the intense fighting would continue until threats are removed now [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  the question is what does what threats are is he referring to and what does [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=870.8s)]
*  removal look like in particular for Israel because if he is referring to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=876.8s)]
*  completely eradicating Iran's nuclear capacity then the general consensus is [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=882.16s)]
*  that they couldn't do that without some kind of US involvement because of the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=886.88s)]
*  fact that some of their nuclear program is in this site Fordow which is deep [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=890.8s)]
*  underground and could only really be struck were US weapons to get involved [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=896.52s)]
*  to help out with that or is threats referring to the Iranian leadership [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=902.28s)]
*  itself in which case again is that something that they would require the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=907.0s)]
*  US government support for these are all questions which is still essentially [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=911.8s)]
*  unanswered we don't yet know exactly what Israel's endgame is in terms of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  your second point about where Israeli public opinion is we have had early polls [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=920.72s)]
*  one from Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University again the usual caveats this [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=925.52s)]
*  is just one poll but saying that there is higher support for the government's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=930.6s)]
*  strikes against Iran among Israeli Jews 83% saying they support the actions as [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  opposed to Arab Israelis only 12% of Arab Israelis saying that they support [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=940.48s)]
*  the government's actions so there are suggestions here that this is something [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=945.16s)]
*  which is dividing the country depending on which community you may be speaking [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  to and that's certainly something that's been echoed among conversations I've [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  been having there are some who see damage that has been inflicted but still [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=955.88s)]
*  back the government in what it is doing there are others though who feel like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  this is only causing more casualties more war more deaths and that is not [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=964.5200000000001s)]
*  something they are particularly happy with [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGX_8FOyAGA&t=968.44s)]
