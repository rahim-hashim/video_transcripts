# Six dead and 39 rescued after tourist submarine sinks in Red Sea, says Egyptian governor | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc)
*  to Egypt because six people have died, two of them children after a tourist submarine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=0.0s)]
*  carrying dozens of Russian visitors sank off Egypt's Red Sea coast. It happened off the resort [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=5.76s)]
*  of Fugada during an underwater excursion to see coral reefs. More than 29 people were rescued, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=11.76s)]
*  some are said to be in a critical condition in hospital. An investigation is underway to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=18.48s)]
*  determine the cause of the accident. Let's get more from our Egypt correspondent, Sallie Nabil. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=23.2s)]
*  We don't know yet what exactly happened and caused this submarine to sink, but according to local [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=28.96s)]
*  sources, we understand that rescue and search operations are still underway off the Red Sea [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=35.84s)]
*  coast. And the question is now why these incidents keep happening quite frequently off the Red Sea [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=41.84s)]
*  coast. I remember last November, I went to the city of Hergada to cover another tragedy when [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=50.16s)]
*  another boat has sunk off the coast of an Egyptian Red Sea resort. There were more than 40 tourists [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=55.76s)]
*  on board at the time. The authorities back then blamed it on a huge wave that hit the boat and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=64.0s)]
*  caused it to capsize. But the BBC has spoken to survivors from this tragedy, and they said that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=70.72s)]
*  the authorities were just trying to cover it up. So frequency of these tragedies, they raise a lot [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=78.4s)]
*  of questions about the security measures employed by the local authorities, especially that these sea [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=84.08s)]
*  excursions, they attract a lot of tourists. The Red Sea resort is a very popular tourist destination [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  now, is a prime time for the tourist season. The weather is sunny, magnificent marine life, and it's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=97.6s)]
*  a very flourishing season. But this tragedy now will deal a very, very heavy blow to the tourism [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=105.52s)]
*  industry, which is a lifeline to the Egyptian economy, in fact. And we have also to note that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=113.2s)]
*  tourism industry is highly dependent on Russian tourists. And according to the Russian embassy in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=119.12s)]
*  Cairo, the submarine had 45 tourists on board. All of them were Russians. Well, that was Sally Nabeel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's speak to Dr. Simon Boxall, senior lecturer of oceanography at the University of Southampton. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=133.04s)]
*  Thank you, Simon, for joining us here on the programme. What are the types of things that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=138.32s)]
*  can go wrong on a submarine like this, especially that it was just outside of the port, wasn't it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  It had just left. These submarines will usually go under sort of diesel engine or engines to get [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=150.32s)]
*  them to site, and then they'll switch to electric, because obviously the diesel won't work underwater. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=155.2s)]
*  So it was heading out towards its sort of dive site. There are probably 20 or 30 of these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  submarines around the world doing tourist trips. They've got a very good safety record thus far. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=167.12s)]
*  This company, Sinbad, operates two of these submarines. They've been doing it for a few [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=172.96s)]
*  years now without incident. I've seen reports now online of people saying that, unlike the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Sea Story incident where many people had complained about the safety issues and safety on board, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=183.6s)]
*  people have been sort of extolling the virtues of these particular submarines. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=189.12s)]
*  So until we know what happened, it is speculation. Had someone left the hatch open, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=192.56s)]
*  that may sound like a stupid statement, but things do happen. There was no sea as such, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=197.44s)]
*  there were no waves as such. It was a flat calm sea out there. So I think we'll have to wait until [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=204.0s)]
*  the initial stories come out from the people who survived. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=210.72s)]
*  Sure. Tell me a little more then about the design of these types of submarines. You mentioned how [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=214.16s)]
*  many of them are worldwide, but what sort of depths are they designed to actually go down to? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=220.48s)]
*  This particular one is rated to 75 metres. Now what's interesting is the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=226.64s)]
*  website talks about, the company's website talks about this as being a Finnish engineered submarine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what Finnish engineered means. Is it made in Finland? If it is, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  it's made of a very, very high standard. So we're not sure when it was built, where it was built. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=243.12s)]
*  But it's difficult to know why this particular one floundered the way it has done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=248.96s)]
*  In terms of emergencies on a tourist submarine, what would passengers have had available to them? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=258.0s)]
*  Would they have, for example, things like oxygen, life belts, that sort of thing, or does that not exist? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=266.72s)]
*  Oh yes, they would have had an oxygen mask which would come down in case the oxygen supply got [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=273.28s)]
*  cut off. So in the event that the vessel got stranded on the seafloor for a bit, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=277.12s)]
*  then they'd have oxygen to help them. It would have been operating, and it's designed to go down [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=281.44s)]
*  to tourists about 25 metres. And I understand this particular case, they even have divers alongside [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=286.24s)]
*  to sort of feed the fish and to sort of, I suppose, enhance the tourist experience. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=292.88s)]
*  They also would have had life jackets, but of course you don't want to put those life jackets [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=299.6s)]
*  on until you actually get out of the vessel, because it's a bit like an aircraft, very narrow, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=302.64s)]
*  openings. There are two openings to get out the vessel itself, and that'll be where the problem [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=307.12s)]
*  comes. If you've got 45 people scrambling to get out through two reasonably narrow hatches, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=311.36s)]
*  then you can start to understand the size of the problem in evacuating a submarine like this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=318.48s)]
*  So it is very difficult potentially to have an evacuation, presumably there'll be no light [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=322.88s)]
*  potentially within the vessel if there has been some sort of emergency. So a very, very difficult [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=328.8s)]
*  environment to get people out quickly. Well, I mean, you would have had light, natural light [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=334.8s)]
*  anyway. So I mean, you know, the water they were working, it was crystal clear, and it was daytime, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  bright sunshine. So there would have been plenty of light just naturally coming through the sea. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  There'd be no point in going down there if that wasn't the case. So light wouldn't have been a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  problem. It would have been literally a question of being able to evacuate the vessel quickly and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=354.56s)]
*  safely. You touched on safety record just generally for tourists and tourist vessels. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=359.52s)]
*  There is obviously a huge amount to learn here in any investigation, but what are the areas that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  you would be looking in terms of basic safety issues in a country like this? And what are the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=373.44s)]
*  things that we don't know? We don't know why, why we would know what the incident was. Did it sink? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=380.0s)]
*  Did it capsize? So until we know that, we can't go to the next stage. But certainly, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=385.84s)]
*  one needs to check that the crew were fully qualified. I'm sure they were, but we need to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=390.96s)]
*  check that. We also need to check when the last safety inspection was on the submarine, and did [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  it meet all of the Egyptian standards? And Egypt insists it has very high standards. We know from [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  experience from liveaboard dive vessels that those standards aren't always met. Doctor, thanks so [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  much for taking time to speak to us. Good to talk to you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puhYRQ5Dcc&t=413.84s)]
