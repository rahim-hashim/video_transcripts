Video Description: The Hamas-run civil defence agency has said at least 55 Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli air strikes in Gaza. 
 
Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the territory this week, with air strikes killing more than 430 people over two days, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
 
Hamas says the ground operation announced by Israel on Wednesday is a "new and dangerous" violation of the ceasefire deal.  Israel resumed attacks on Tuesday as talks to extend the deal failed to progress.
 
Israel has warned that attacks will intensify in Gaza until Hamas releases the remaining hostages.
 
The BBC does not currently have access to Gaza.

# At least 55 killed in new Israeli Gaza strikes, says Hamas-run agency | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8)
*  Now, the Gaza civil defense agency, which is run by Hamas, says at least 55 people were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=0.0s)]
*  killed overnight as Israel's new military offensive continues for a third day. Hamas [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=6.36s)]
*  has condemned a ground operation by Israeli forces as a new and dangerous violation of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=12.24s)]
*  the ceasefire deal. Our Middle East correspondent Yolande Nel has the latest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=18.68s)]
*  So there have been intense strikes overnight. In fact, some of the scenes that are coming [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=23.52s)]
*  out from Gaza really reminiscent of what was happening at the height of the war. In one [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=27.76s)]
*  hospital in the north of Gaza, you can see dozens of bodies, those of adults and children, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=33.0s)]
*  wrapped up in white shrouds, lined up for a burial after these overnight strikes in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=39.44s)]
*  the area. Other parts of Gaza were hit as well. And we've also got, you know, other [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  signs that this ceasefire is continuing to unravel. Israeli ground forces, more troops [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=50.52s)]
*  going into the south of the Gaza Strip, and they've also retaken part of what's known [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=56.48s)]
*  as the Netzerim Corridor, which divides the north of Gaza from the southern part. Very [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  strong comments yesterday evening from the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=67.84s)]
*  warning that attacks are going to intensify unless Hamas releases all of the remaining [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=73.36s)]
*  hostages and gives up its control of Gaza. Hamas has not declared at this stage that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=79.12s)]
*  it's going to return to fighting. We know that there is a lot going on diplomatically [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=86.16s)]
*  behind the scenes. Yes, so it's a bit more about what's happening behind the scenes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=91.64s)]
*  Have those mediation efforts completely broken down now? We believe that regional mediators [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  are talking to Hamas. We've had comments from Washington basically saying that a bridging [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=105.0s)]
*  proposal that it put forward last week, which Israel approved of, was still on the table, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=111.56s)]
*  at least for now. Hamas, of course, had rejected that proposal. It put forward its own proposal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  to extend the ceasefire, whereby a smaller number of hostages would be returned, one [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  living American Israeli soldier and four bodies it was offering. And the Americans had been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=131.4s)]
*  demanding a larger number of living hostages to be returned in exchange for at least an [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  extension of the ceasefire. Hamas is really saying consistently that it wants to return [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=143.4s)]
*  to the original terms of the ceasefire deal that started on the 19th of January, and it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=149.36s)]
*  sees what's been happening as violations of that. It really wants to get to the second [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=157.12s)]
*  phase of that, which would ultimately involve an end to the war in Gaza, a full pullout [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=161.88s)]
*  of Israeli troops. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsKw55_vRo8&t=167.48s)]
