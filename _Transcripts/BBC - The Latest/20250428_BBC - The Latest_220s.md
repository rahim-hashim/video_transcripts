# Spain and Portugal hit by widespread power cuts | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw)
*  Let's start with that massive power cut that has hit large parts of Spain and Portugal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=0.0s)]
*  Public transport, communications and many businesses have been affected. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=4.8s)]
*  Hospitals are operating normally. They have generators. So that's some good news from there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=8.8s)]
*  But what is not known at the moment is what caused the problem that Spanish and Portuguese [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=13.68s)]
*  governments have been holding emergency meetings after the outage. We are closely watching all the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=17.92s)]
*  news coming out of Spain and Portugal and we've just heard from the Spanish grid operator REE [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=23.36s)]
*  that says restoring power could take between six and ten hours from now. Well our correspondent [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=28.56s)]
*  Joe Inwood has been looking at what has been happening. So many different reports coming in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=35.12s)]
*  of chaos, particularly when it comes to transport. Yeah, public transport is going to be one of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  areas hit hardest and it seems that metro, subway, underground systems across the peninsula, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=44.08s)]
*  Spain and Portugal are out of action. Traffic lights as well. We've got images coming in from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=49.04s)]
*  Madrid and elsewhere of all the traffic lights down and obviously the ensuing chaos you get [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=53.36s)]
*  when that happens. We're so used to these things just working automatically and when they go down [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=58.0s)]
*  well you can imagine what happens. So what do we know then Joe of what actually the problem is [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=61.76s)]
*  and what's gone wrong? At this point nothing. At this point I've not seen any reports that say [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=66.4s)]
*  what caused this massive power outage. We do know at the scale of it, it seems really a large amount [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=71.12s)]
*  of the Iberian Peninsula, as I say, of Spain and Portugal have been taken down. And parts of France as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Parts of France as well, yeah. So Red Electrica is the state-owned network company. So they're not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=80.8s)]
*  the electricity generators, they're the ones that get it from the power stations to your home, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=85.92s)]
*  to your business. So they obviously have some stations or they have power lines that go into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  France as well, it seems. And so there's been a mild effect there but I think the main effect, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=97.04s)]
*  the biggest impact is, as I said, in Spain and Portugal. And we've just been hearing that it [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  could be six to ten hours before services are restored. It's a long time for people to be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=106.48s)]
*  without power, possibly needing to get home or their phones might go down. I mean this is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=112.64s)]
*  going to have a massive effect. It is. I mean luckily, just kind of looking at the times now, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  luckily it seems that by the time it starts to get really dark people will start to get the power back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=120.72s)]
*  on. But as you say, all of our lives are completely dependent on this. And so for people who are trying [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  to go about their work, go about just live their normal life, it's going to be very, very difficult. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=130.96s)]
*  As you mentioned before though, of course, there are lots of places that have contingency back up. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=135.44s)]
*  If you're a hospital, well you're luckily not going to be affected with larger hospitals. But we saw [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=140.08s)]
*  recently, I mean it's obviously a separate issue, a separate cause, but with the fire we had at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=145.28s)]
*  substations that took out Heathrow Airport and the amount of time it took that to get back on and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=151.28s)]
*  disruption caused. And that's just one airport. So in terms of the disruption we're going to be seeing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=155.6s)]
*  from the entire country losing power, well that's going to be incredibly significant. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=160.24s)]
*  Jo, thank you so much. We're monitoring all of the wires and the information that's coming into [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=163.52s)]
*  us from the Iberian Peninsula. I can tell you Spain's National Security Council have just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=167.2s)]
*  announced that they are going to meet to coordinate a response to these mass power outages. And we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  also know Spain's Energy Minister has been to talk to the suppliers of energy to see what's going on. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=175.6s)]
*  So a big coordinated response happening in Spain as well. The live page is up and running on the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=181.44s)]
*  BBC News website covering this extensively. Our team is talking to people on the ground who have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=186.32s)]
*  been affected. I'm just seeing one here. Kirsty, a teacher in Madrid, who's talking about how [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=191.12s)]
*  devastating it is for many of the children there because they don't have 5G and they can't charge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=195.52s)]
*  their phones. You can imagine what that's like for teenagers in Madrid at the moment. But seriously, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=200.56s)]
*  she said it's lucky that this happened after lunch because everyone got their cooked lunch. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=205.28s)]
*  But there are real concerns about how to get the children home when the metro system is down. So [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=208.88s)]
*  do go to the live page and keep up to date with all the developments from the Iberian Peninsula on there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8RPRcZMtJw&t=213.52s)]
