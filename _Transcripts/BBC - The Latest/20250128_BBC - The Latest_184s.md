Video Description: US President Donald Trump has called the rise of Chinese company DeepSeek "a wake-up call" for the US tech industry, after the emergence of its artificial intelligence (AI) model triggered shockwaves on Wall Street.
 
Shares in major tech firms such as Nvidia fell sharply, with the chip giant losing almost $600bn (Â£482bn) in market value.
 
What has shaken the industry is DeepSeek's claim that its R1 model was made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals - raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.
 
DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched.

# DeepSeek a 'wake-up call' for US tech firms, Donald Trump says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw)
*  President Trump says the rapid rise of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=0.0s)]
*  is a wake-up call for the US tech industry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  DeepSeek, which its owners say costs around just $6 million to develop, has become the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=8.48s)]
*  most downloaded free app in the US. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=13.44s)]
*  It appears to require less powerful computer chips than its American tech giant rivals. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=16.2s)]
*  But Mr Trump said he was confident that the US would remain dominant in the field. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=20.8s)]
*  Our North America technology correspondent, Lily Jumali, has more. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=25.7s)]
*  From a virtual unknown to most downloaded app in Apple's US App Store, DeepSeek has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=29.64s)]
*  become an overnight sensation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=35.08s)]
*  It's an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI's chat GPT, which first catapulted AI into the mainstream. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=37.36s)]
*  DeepSeek can offer quick and comprehensive answers to your questions, from, who is King [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=44.52s)]
*  Charles? to, what should I make for dinner? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=49.36s)]
*  Introduced last week, by Monday it had caught fire in the US, sending shockwaves through [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  global markets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=57.68s)]
*  DeepSeek's Chinese developers claim they trained its models for a fraction of the funds and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  computing power used by competitors. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=64.24s)]
*  DeepSeek really changes the game. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=66.84s)]
*  It's not that it's better than any existing models, but it's cheaper and it doesn't require [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=69.24s)]
*  as many H100s. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=75.2s)]
*  And a lot of the US foreign policy around AI has been about how many of these fancy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=76.2s)]
*  chips other people get to use. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=81.72s)]
*  And China figured out a workaround to that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=84.34s)]
*  US tech stocks sent into freefall. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=87.76s)]
*  Shares of the AI chip designer Nvidia most notably fell by as much as 17% on Monday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  But spend enough time on DeepSeek and you notice that it doesn't answer certain questions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=97.12s)]
*  When our team asked what happened at Tiananmen Square, the response we got was, I'm sorry, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=102.68s)]
*  I cannot answer that question. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=108.68s)]
*  I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=110.6s)]
*  From what we've observed, DeepSeek consistently steers clear of answering questions that might [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=115.96s)]
*  be deemed politically sensitive by China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=120.5s)]
*  In the particular case of DeepSeek, they have a bias built in to say things that are consistent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  with what the Chinese party wants them to say. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=129.64s)]
*  The deletion example where it gave an answer and walked the answer back shows you that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=132.56s)]
*  something has been added on, bolted on to try to make this thing conform to somebody's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=137.32s)]
*  idea of what's politically acceptable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=142.22s)]
*  China and the US are embroiled in an AI race. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=145.52s)]
*  Just last week, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a joint venture involving a half [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=148.4s)]
*  trillion dollar investment by global tech giants in AI infrastructure. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=153.48s)]
*  The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=158.3s)]
*  that we need to be laser focused on competing to win. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=165.6s)]
*  The UK government says Britain's 14 billion pound AI infrastructure investment also remains [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=169.28s)]
*  on track. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=174.64s)]
*  With the arrival of DeepSeek, the AI race has just grown more heated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarfOVg5anw&t=175.83999999999997s)]
