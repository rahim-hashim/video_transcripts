**BBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg)
*  Today I'm Ben Thompson. We're going to start with news that US President Donald Trump and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=0.0s)]
*  Chinese teams will meet shortly after he and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed trade [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=4.16s)]
*  in a phone call earlier on Thursday, adding that there should be no longer any questions on rare [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=9.28s)]
*  earth products. Now you may know China dominates the trade in rare earths. They're vital in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=15.36s)]
*  production of electronics and cars amongst a whole host of other things. Now the conversation was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=19.92s)]
*  focused almost entirely on trade. Nothing was discussed concerning Russia, Ukraine or Iran. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=25.6s)]
*  That's what President Trump wrote on social media, adding that the two leaders had invited [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=31.44s)]
*  each other to their respective countries for visits. So let's get the thoughts now of Erin [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=36.24s)]
*  Delmore who's in New York for us. And Erin, give us a sense here of how important this call was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=40.96s)]
*  and what we seem to get a sense of about, you know, that rare earth issue. Such an important one. And [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=47.2s)]
*  if there is any breakthrough there, that would be quite a moment, wouldn't it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=52.8s)]
*  It absolutely would be. It's one of the chief concerns here in the US-China relationship. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And Ben, when you talk about how important this call is, well, certainly it's important to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  investors and to business leaders who are eager for some kind of stability in this US-China trade [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  relationship amid all of the upheaval that we've seen in recent months. And it also seems to be [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=72.24s)]
*  very important to President Trump. He said quite a few times and even intimated in April that the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=76.8s)]
*  two had spoken, but largely he's been saying that he's been eager for a phone call with President [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=82.0s)]
*  Xi. And the Chinese side did make it clear today that the call had happened at President Trump's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=86.88s)]
*  request. Now, while President Trump said that there should be no questions further surrounding [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=91.52s)]
*  rare earth metals, the social media posts that he put up itself doesn't have a lot of detail to it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=96.48s)]
*  We don't know what was progressed or what was agreed upon in this phone call, but what we do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=102.48s)]
*  know is that the two sides plan to meet, according to President Trump, and that he plans to send Howard [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=107.68s)]
*  Lutnick, Jameson Greer and Scott Besant, his three closest and top economic advisors, to those talks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  He also spoke about a friendly relationship with President Xi, said that the President had [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=119.04s)]
*  extended an invitation for him and the First Lady to come to China and that he reciprocated and he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  called them leaders of two great nations. Yeah, and that would be quite a moment too, wouldn't it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=127.84s)]
*  Because, you know, the two countries have been, let's say, at loggerheads, particularly about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=132.4s)]
*  things like trade. We know that the White House had slapped massive tariffs on Chinese-made products [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=136.48s)]
*  being imported into the United States. It feels like there is some sort of thawing in that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=141.2s)]
*  relationship, albeit maybe just a diplomatic one right now. I think they would take even that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=145.76s)]
*  opening, Ben. I mean, we're seeing some of this tension spill over into other issues as well, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=151.76s)]
*  for instance, about Chinese student visas here in the United States. And this is really why we tend [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  to call things a trade war, you know, an escalation on the front. There's always this idea that if you [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=161.84s)]
*  don't have these kinds of diplomatic moments of coming together, things could escalate further. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=167.36s)]
*  And that has definitely been the fears among some business owners here in the United States, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=171.68s)]
*  especially ones that rely on China not only for finished goods but for component goods to then [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=175.52s)]
*  make into finished goods for sale here in the United States. So when we talk about where we were [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=180.4s)]
*  just about a month and a half ago with these triple-digit tariffs on Chinese goods imported [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=184.88s)]
*  into the U.S., well, a lot of what is to come is being negotiated at the moment, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=190.0s)]
*  and a lot of folks are eager for something permanent and something lower that they can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=194.4s)]
*  plan their businesses around. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3R_4dyl1gg&t=198.08s)]
