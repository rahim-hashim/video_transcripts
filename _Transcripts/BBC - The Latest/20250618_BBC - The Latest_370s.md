# At least 40 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza, says health ministry | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro)
*  Welcome back to today's verified live. Let's as promised turn to Gaza because the health ministry says at least 40 people have been killed by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli fire in the Palestinian territory today including 14 who were seeking aid. The Israeli military said [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=7.96s)]
*  there were repeated warnings the area is an active combat zone and a group of suspicious individuals were identified as posing a threat to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=14.46s)]
*  IDF forces. Well witness reports and medical officials inside Gaza said that more than 50 people were killed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=22.62s)]
*  yesterday when Israeli forces opened fire using tanks and drones in what was potentially the deadliest of the shootings that have taken place [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=29.92s)]
*  near aid distribution sites. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=38.32s)]
*  Well a little earlier James Elder from UNICEF, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=41.72s)]
*  well he posted this video from Gaza in the last 36 hours. Have a look at this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=46.0s)]
*  I just spoke with a woman who spent nine years trying to conceive and now her only [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=51.7s)]
*  child, her son and her husband have just been killed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=57.58s)]
*  A look of despair, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=61.06s)]
*  despair in her eyes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=63.18s)]
*  Immediately after I'm talking to a mum who is watching her little boy die in front of her because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=65.18s)]
*  he's denied medical evacuation or I think of little rehab I met who said and I'll read it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  They killed my mother. I used to be beautiful now I cannot wash. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=77.78s)]
*  What do you want me to say? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=83.7s)]
*  What is there to say in the face of such pain? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=86.94s)]
*  Such pain here in Gaza and such impunity everywhere else. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=92.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=97.18s)]
*  Maybe that's it. Sorry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=99.74s)]
*  Well that was James Elder in Gaza. He's now out of Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=102.22s)]
*  He joined me just a little earlier on the program and we talked about that heartbreaking video [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=105.66s)]
*  and what he's been seeing over the last few days. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  When you and I are speaking now there is without doubt Gaza is in its worst state [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=114.46s)]
*  and that's because of everything that we know because there's an attempt to circumvent an aid system [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=119.1s)]
*  and militarise it and mass casualty events every day because people are, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  half a million people are starving and they're taking their food and drinking [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  and they're starving and they're taken to official combat sites and then the scenes are horrendous. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=131.1s)]
*  I would see them in the evenings from where I stayed but now at the same time we have a water crisis [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=136.38s)]
*  which is famine like of water if you will. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=141.82s)]
*  Ever since the horrors of October 7 Matthew, electricity was turned off to the Gaza Strip [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=144.94s)]
*  so water supply requires fuel from the wells, from the desalination plant to the trucks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=150.22s)]
*  No fuel has been allowed in Gaza for 100 days. That continues. We start seeing children die of thirst. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=154.94s)]
*  Already people are drinking brackish water. We have not seen this before. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=160.62s)]
*  So yeah the people of Gaza have been pushed to another, another, another brink. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=164.22s)]
*  When you say things are getting worse we see the pictures, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=170.94s)]
*  all of us are constantly updated by statistics, just raw numbers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=175.5s)]
*  It's really difficult to actually be able to gauge what people are going through. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=179.9s)]
*  Just give us more of a glimpse of the sorts of things you have seen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=185.18s)]
*  Yeah so for example, a little, so when I first got there Matthew it was very clear to understand [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=190.78s)]
*  and because there was so much disinformation around what was happening at these militarized sites [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=197.18s)]
*  and we were hearing horrendous stories so I immediately went to Nassau Hospital. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=202.22s)]
*  Nassau Hospital is under siege everywhere around it is an evacuation site [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=206.22s)]
*  and I immediately met a little boy, a 13 year old little boy who sticks with me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  He had been given money by his father to go on by bread. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=216.3s)]
*  The family is starving. Starving is a technical term. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=218.78s)]
*  Famine is too late, you've got mass death. Starving the body is starting to collapse. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=220.94s)]
*  That's happening across Gaza. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=224.62s)]
*  As he saw it he saw people heading to one of these distribution points and he thought [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=226.86s)]
*  this is my moment to help my family. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=230.62s)]
*  He went there, same thing, quadcopters shooting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=232.78s)]
*  He got shrapnel from a tank shell. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=235.02s)]
*  When I met him he was in immense pain because there's no painkillers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=237.82s)]
*  These days Matthew you don't just see the wounds of warren children, you hear them, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=241.1s)]
*  you hear the screams of girls and boys. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=244.86s)]
*  This little boy though, I just did a video because his family wanted his story told [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=247.1s)]
*  because they wanted medical evacuation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  He sat up Matthew, he sat up through the pain, it was immense. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=252.7s)]
*  Anyway, Abdul Rahman, 13 year old boy and I saw him a couple more times. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  His mother doing everything she possibly could. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=261.34s)]
*  His situation declining. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=263.82s)]
*  Countries around the world not willing to take children and the day I left he died. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=265.42s)]
*  Another child who's killed trying to get food for their families. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=270.7s)]
*  Those stories north to south, east to west. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=274.94s)]
*  Now in Paris and in London and in other capitals only a fortnight or so ago there was growing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=278.14s)]
*  anger from governments at food being used as a weapon, the blocking of UN aid deliveries. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  How concerned are you that we now have another conflict in the Middle East, Israel, Iran, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=291.34s)]
*  that appears to be again diverting attention and focus? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=298.06s)]
*  Well, hugely because this is now the worst moment that those people in Gaza have had. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=301.82s)]
*  And it would seem straightforward that if the world understood that the denial of more [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=308.62s)]
*  than 100 days of fuel being allowed into the Gaza Strip means that children are going to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=312.86s)]
*  start dying of thirst, I don't even know if there is not a historical precedent whereby [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=317.34s)]
*  a population is denied all the means of survival whilst they are bombed on a daily basis and not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=323.58s)]
*  allowed to leave the combat site. So yeah, it's a treacherous time and Gazans feel that, Matthew. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=330.78s)]
*  That's very sad. I speak to a lot of people when I'm in Gaza and they say to me in perfect English [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=335.34s)]
*  that we are well aware that international humanitarian law does not apply to us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  They too feel the great distraction that it is a great distraction now, geopolitical that it is, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=344.7s)]
*  but that the world has looked away at a time where as a father said to me, we've learned to live as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  much as we don't. We've learned to live having lost loved ones, having seen our home of 30 years [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=356.38s)]
*  destroyed, that we took 30 years to build destroyed. We've even learned to live without [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=361.18s)]
*  food for a week. We can't live without water, but the world's attention is diverted. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJmOI-9yHro&t=364.7s)]
