Video Description: China has sent a team of three astronauts to its space station in an ambitious goal to become a space power and rival the dominance of Nasa in the US.
 
Beijing has spent billions of dollars into what President Xi has described as the nation's “space dream” in recent years.  
 
The all-male trio were sent off with huge fanfare in the remote northwestern desert of the country on Thursday.
 
The team will work on the station for six months, carrying out experiments and installing protective equipment to maintain the station from space debris.

# China launches new crewed mission into space | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY)
*  as promised because we are continuing to monitor the space launch that we're expecting. This [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=0.0s)]
*  is China's Jiquan Space Launch Center and it is described as being set deep in the Gobi [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Desert. Well, in the next three or so minutes, we're expecting that rocket that we're seeing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=12.92s)]
*  to take up these three Chinese astronauts. They will go up to the Tiangong Space Station. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=18.76s)]
*  This is China's Tiangong Space Station and when it comes to Chinese astronauts, they [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=26.54s)]
*  are in fact called Taikonauts, something sort of similar to what we used to have with the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Soviet space race when they weren't called astronauts. The USSR would call them cosmonauts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  So China calling astronauts Taikonauts, three of them due to go up there to replace the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  three astronauts who are currently on the Chinese space station. And then these three [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=50.26s)]
*  like them those before they will stay up there for roughly six months. So they're expecting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=56.06s)]
*  to blast off in about two minutes time. The three astronauts, they are Cheng Dong, Chen [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Zhuangri and Wang Jie and the station's current three person crew who these guys will be replacing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=68.14s)]
*  They have been up there since October last year. They then will rotate with the three [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=75.98s)]
*  astronauts heading there today and they'll return to the Dongfeng landing site and we'll [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=81.3s)]
*  expect that return on the 29th of April. Now, so we about a minute away from blast off. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=86.7s)]
*  So while they are up there, the astronauts or Taikonauts as the Chinese describe them, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=95.14s)]
*  they will be conducting various experiments. They're going to install also a space debris [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=101.22s)]
*  protection device while also performing recovery tasks. It's well known that there are various [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=107.02s)]
*  different articles, particles up in space that often cause damage to satellites as they [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=115.5s)]
*  hurtle through the space at very quick speeds. So these three astronauts will be amongst [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=122.46s)]
*  the different various tasks that they have. They'll be installing a space debris protection [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=129.26s)]
*  device and also I can tell you that they are going to bring with them zebrafish, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=135.78s)]
*  a type also planarians, a type of worm and a type of bacteria as well. All part of research objects [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=144.1s)]
*  to carry out three life science experiments at the space station. So they'll be taking live forms, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=152.5s)]
*  type of worm, zebrafish and also a type of bacteria and they'll be carrying out life science [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=160.34s)]
*  experiments while up there. Lots of well-wishers there to see them off as they head off imminently. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=167.06s)]
*  We're expecting it imminently blast off. I wonder if we can hear any sound. It's always great to hear [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=176.34s)]
*  a countdown so let's just listen in shall we. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=184.9s)]
*  And we have liftoff as China sends a new team of astronauts to its space station [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=244.9s)]
*  as it continues in its march towards its ambition of becoming a space power to rival [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=267.54s)]
*  the dominance of the United States. Beijing pumping in billions of dollars into its space [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=274.34s)]
*  program in recent years in an effort to what President Xi Jinping describes as the Chinese [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  people's space dream. They have these bold plans to send a crewed mission to the moon by the end [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  of the decade and eventually to build a base on the lunar service. So here we have the three [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=297.3s)]
*  Chinese astronauts known as taikonauts as they're called in by China on their way up to China's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=305.62s)]
*  Tiangong space station and these three will be replacing the three crew who are currently at [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=313.54s)]
*  the Chinese space station and they'll be up there roughly like the crew they're already for around [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=322.26s)]
*  three months performing various different activities, experiments and installing a space [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=328.82s)]
*  debris protection device. On board with them a planarian, a type of worm, also a streptomyces, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=338.74s)]
*  a type of bacteria and a zebrafish. Joining the three-man crew as they make their way up to the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=351.38s)]
*  Chinese space station. Leading this mission, Cheng Dong, he's a former fighter pilot and he's a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=362.82s)]
*  veteran space explorer. Back in 2022 he became the first Chinese astronaut to clock up [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=375.3s)]
*  more than 200 cumulative days in orbit. So a lot of experience [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=382.1s)]
*  with him. Two other crew members, also a former Air Force pilot Chen Zhengri and a former space [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=389.86s)]
*  technology engineer Wang Jie. For them this is their first space flight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=399.46s)]
*  And as we saw hundreds of well-wishers there at the site of liftoff [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  wishing these three a lot of luck. There was singing and flowers, national flags being waved [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=417.38s)]
*  in the streets of the space base just hours before this liftoff. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=427.29999999999995s)]
*  So amongst the tasks that this crew will have, spacewalks, also replenishing supplies [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=440.02s)]
*  and also carrying out general maintenance on the space station. So they're going to be busy [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=448.02s)]
*  during the six months that they are up there replacing the crew who have already spent [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=452.34s)]
*  six months aboard Tiangong, the Chinese space station. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  And the three up there, they're scheduled to return to Earth on April the 29th after [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=466.97999999999996s)]
*  completing handover procedures. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=471.94s)]
*  So they make their way up with those aquatic flatworms on board as well. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=474.02s)]
*  Having been wished a lot of success after what President Xi Jinping describes as [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=493.38s)]
*  the Chinese people's space dream, all part of China's ambition to become a space power, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=500.66s)]
*  that rivalry with the United States still going strong. So we've been watching that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=508.74s)]
*  liftoff from the Chinese taikonauts take place live from the Gobi Desert. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-LWeAcqgY&t=515.5400000000001s)]
