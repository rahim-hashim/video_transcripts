*  Binge eating cake and cooking up exotic fungi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the latest on the trial of Australia's toxic mushroom cook. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=2.88s)]
*  This is a case that's fascinated people both here in Australia and worldwide. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=6.32s)]
*  But it's been particularly interesting this week because the woman on trial [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=10.72s)]
*  has been giving evidence herself. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=13.68s)]

*  another when she invited them over to her house and served them a beef Wellington [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=19.6s)]
*  containing toxic death cap mushrooms. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=23.52s)]
*  Within days of that lunch in July 2023, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=25.6s)]
*  three of her relatives were dead. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=28.88s)]
*  There was one survivor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=30.64s)]
*  Erin Patterson started the week in the witness box answering questions from her lawyers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=31.68s)]
*  She told the court that she didn't eat much of that beef Wellington meal because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=35.76s)]
*  she'd been talking so much. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  But after the guests had gone, she tucked into a cake, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  binge eating two thirds of it before then making herself sick. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=43.2s)]
*  Now though, she's being cross-examined by the prosecution and the mood in court [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=46.64s)]
*  has completely changed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=50.56s)]
*  The prosecutor's been firing questions at Erin Patterson, pushing her on every bit [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  of her story and repeatedly suggesting she intended to kill those lunch guests. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=56.08s)]
*  This was meant to be a six week trial, but we're already in week six and the judge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=60.16s)]
*  reckons there'll be another two weeks to go before the jury retires to consider its verdict. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIM2_bUwc4&t=64.72s)]
