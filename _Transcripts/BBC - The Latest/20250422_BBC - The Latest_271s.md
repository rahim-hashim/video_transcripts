*  coffin will be transferred across Rome to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=95.44s)]
*  that is on the other side of Rome and that is where Pope Francis said that he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  wanted to be buried now it is rare for Pope's not to be buried at the Vatican [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=103.4s)]
*  it's more than a hundred years since the Pope was not buried at the Vatican and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  it's very much typical of the kind of more humble quieter end to his life that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=111.28s)]
*  he wanted yeah absolutely actually he streamlined the funeral as well as [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=115.68s)]
*  unity because in the past Pope's were buried in three different coffins [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  starting with a Cyprus coffin but he has wanted to do things differently from the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=122.2s)]
*  start he wants to be in a coffin that was wood and zinc and just to be laid in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  the ground simply with his name in Latin Francis this is a man who you know from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=131.4s)]
*  his humble beginnings then that very much shaped his humility as Pope taking [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=136.52s)]
*  the name Francis after Saint Francis of Assisi shunning the kind of ornate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=141.96s)]
*  clothing for example of his predecessor he didn't like the red papal shoes he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=147.92s)]
*  wore his slightly scuffed black shoes he lived as you say marry him in the Santa [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=151.6s)]
*  Marta guest house not in the elaborate ornate papal apartments and that will [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=155.12s)]
*  be that will that will shape the end of his life just as it as it shaped his [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=158.92s)]
*  And of course the conclave happens after those nine days of official mourning a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=163.76s)]
*  very secretive process that I have to say fascinates so many people around the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=169.04s)]
*  world not least because of the Oscar-nominated movie. Yeah indeed which you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=173.92s)]
*  know I'm sure you and I have seen and many others have seen as well and you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  know having been based here for five years and talking a lot of talking to a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=181.88s)]
*  lot of people about what how a conclave works I think there's a lot of truth in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  that in that movie about you know how suddenly all the cardinals are [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=188.56s)]
*  shut inside the Sistine Chapel the shutters come down they're cut off from [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=193.0s)]
*  the outside world there are no phones there's no TV there's no connectivity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=197.4s)]
*  with the outside world there was simply the presence of the Holy Spirit and then [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=201.0s)]
*  they they cast their votes they've got to be under the age of 80 the cardinal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=204.56s)]
*  electors 138 of them and they will cast their votes on the first day of voting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=208.76s)]
*  there'll be one vote and then followed by that there'll be two votes in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=213.96s)]
*  morning and two in the afternoon initially for a card for a cardinal to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=217.32s)]
*  get a two-thirds majority to be named Pope if that does not if that after 15 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=221.2s)]
*  days there's no there's no requisite two-thirds majority it changes to a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=226.0s)]
*  50% plus one vote and then after each vote the the ballot papers are burned [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=230.32s)]
*  and if there is no conclusive winner of the conclave there is a special chemical [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=236.0s)]
*  put in for the smoke to be black but if there is a cardinal who emerges [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=241.44s)]
*  victorious to be chosen as the next successor to St. Peter at the 267th [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=246.76s)]
*  Pope then a chemical is put in for white smoke to come up from a chimney just [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=251.12s)]
*  across there across St. Peter's Square and that is when we are here then we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=255.52s)]
*  will be able to see it from here and that is where we are likely to hear the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=259.04s)]
*  the cheers of there will probably be I mean there will certainly be hundreds of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=261.44s)]
*  thousands of people from St. Peter's Square down the road into central Rome [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=264.92s)]
*  and that is when we will know that there is a new Pope [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=268.36s)]
