Video Description: Bill Gates has revealed just how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.
 
"I've given over 100 billion," he said in an interview with the BBC, "but I still have more to give."
 
The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation, which he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.
 
Gates said philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him "with wealth came the responsibility to give it away".
