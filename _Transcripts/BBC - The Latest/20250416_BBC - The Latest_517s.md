Video Description: China has unexpectedly appointed a new trade envoy, as officials said the US's practice of "tariff barriers and trade bullying" is having a serious impact on the global economic order.
 
Li Chenggang, a former World Trade Organisation and UN representative, is taking over from veteran trade negotiator Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen.
 
The shift comes as Beijing refuses to back down in an escalating trade war with Washington, triggered by US President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese goods.

# China appoints new trade envoy amid US tariff war | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE)
*  China has appointed a new international trade negotiator following the outbreak of a devastating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=0.0s)]
*  tariff war between Beijing and Washington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=5.24s)]
*  Li Changgang's appointment is seen as a sign that Beijing is preparing for a tough [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=8.2s)]
*  period of trade relations following the onslaught of Donald Trump's 145% tariffs on Chinese [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  goods. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has urged China to make a deal with the US. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=20.88s)]
*  Well, our China correspondent, Stephen McDonnell, is in Beijing with the full story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  What do we know about this person who's been appointed, Stephen? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=29.36s)]
*  Well, certainly the appointment of Li Changgang shows two things. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=34.0s)]
*  One that the Chinese government sees difficult waters ahead and needs someone to help steer [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=39.56s)]
*  through those waters, but also that it is potentially preparing to, at some point, negotiate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  with the US. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  Now, why do I say that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Because he's a decades long experienced trade negotiator. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  He's the former Chinese ambassador to the World Trade Organization in Geneva and just [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=58.48s)]
*  the type of person you would want if you were the Chinese government and you wanted to sit [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  down with the US and do a deal on trade. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=67.6s)]
*  So where are we at with the trade war? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=70.14s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump says the ball is now in China's court. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=72.32s)]
*  He's said to his supporters that China needs to do a deal with us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=77.12s)]
*  Well, the Chinese government isn't behaving like it needs to do anything of the sort and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=82.0s)]
*  is instead digging in. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=86.68s)]
*  And I'll just read you, this is something from an editorial here from state run media [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=89.76s)]
*  here that China Daily, English language media controlled by the government, calling on the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=94.56s)]
*  US to stop whining when it comes to trade, saying that the US is not getting ripped off [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=99.84s)]
*  by anybody, but rather it's been living beyond its means for decades, borrowing to achieve [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=107.2s)]
*  a higher standard of living than it's entitled to based on its actual productivity. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=115.06s)]
*  So a lot of barbs there from the Communist Party directed towards the US showing that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=120.66s)]
*  they're just pushing back yet again on Donald Trump and essentially saying, we're not in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=127.62s)]
*  any rush. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=133.18s)]
*  I mean, there is an acknowledgement here that this is going to hurt, but China is saying [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=134.18s)]
*  to the rest of the world, we can tough it out and really everybody else should be standing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=139.74s)]
*  up to Donald Trump in the face of such bullying as well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=143.7s)]
*  So talk us through how China is trying to bolster trade relations with other places [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  while this is going on with the US. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=154.5s)]
*  Yes, so people following relations will know that Xi Jinping has been travelling around [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=157.78s)]
*  the region while Donald Trump's waiting for his phone call from Xi Jinping. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  China's leader has been meeting the leaders of Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=171.05999999999997s)]
*  They're all countries that have been whacked really hard with tariffs from the US. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=175.38s)]
*  Of course, China has a good message for them saying, stick with us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  We're a really big important player in the region, your biggest trading partner. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=185.42s)]
*  We're not sticking tariffs on you, unlike the US. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=190.54s)]
*  And so again, we need to all band together in the face of this pressure from the US. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=194.14s)]
*  Now, it's interesting because today, China released its growth figures for the first [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=199.38s)]
*  quarter of this year, better than expected, 5.4% GDP. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=204.82s)]
*  That said, the representative who released these figures did acknowledge that these tariffs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=210.3s)]
*  from the US are going to hurt the Chinese economy, are going to hurt especially China's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=214.3s)]
*  companies exporting into the US market. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=219.02s)]
*  And we've seen these reports that, for example, there's just a little slice of life here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=221.5s)]
*  The companies here that usually make Christmas decorations for the US, they normally have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=228.06s)]
*  their orders by now for this year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=232.86s)]
*  They say they're getting nothing from the US because of the potential increase in prices [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=235.78s)]
*  because of the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=241.1s)]
*  So if you are a US consumer this year, I guess you can either drag out last year's Christmas [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=243.9s)]
*  decorations or just expect to pay more for this year's decorations. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=249.46s)]
*  And that way, hurting both US consumers and Chinese export companies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=254.94s)]
*  Both governments know this, and it's a question of which one of them will blink first. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=259.86s)]
*  Stephen, for the moment, thank you very much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=263.9s)]
*  Stephen MacDonald in Beijing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=266.02s)]
*  Well, as Stephen referred to there, President Xi Jinping is in Malaysia as he continues [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=267.46s)]
*  what's being described as a charm offensive of Southeast Asia. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=272.54s)]
*  Beijing has warned the US tariffs are putting pressure on the Chinese economy, which, as [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=276.02s)]
*  grew by 5.4% year on year in the first quarter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=281.26s)]
*  Well, here's the White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, speaking on Tuesday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=285.34s)]
*  The ball is in China's court. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  China needs to make a deal with us. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=293.5s)]
*  We don't have to make a deal with them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=295.38s)]
*  There's no difference between China and any other country, except they are much larger. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=297.7s)]
*  And China wants what we have, what every country wants, what we have, the American consumer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=302.26s)]
*  Or to put it another way, they need our money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=308.98s)]
*  So the president, again, has made it quite clear that he's open to a deal with China, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  but China needs to make a deal with the United States of America. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=315.5s)]
*  Let's go to Kuala Lumpur and speak to our correspondent, Nick Marsh. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  How are the Malaysians likely to respond to this message from President Xi to resist Washington's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=323.66s)]
*  bullying, Nick? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=331.38s)]
*  Well, Malaysia's already pretty close with China, both economically and especially under [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=335.1s)]
*  the most recent prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  He's seen as probably one of the most pro-China leaders that Malaysia's had in recent years. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  He's actually right in here, Martin. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=350.3s)]
*  This is his office. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=352.38s)]
*  This is where Xi Jinping is now, with Anwar Ibrahim holding these talks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=353.38s)]
*  This whole trip was actually planned before the recent escalation in this trade war between [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=358.54s)]
*  Washington and Beijing, but it's come at a pretty great time, hasn't it? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  This is a perfect opportunity for Xi Jinping to come here, deliver that message, as Stephen [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=369.42s)]
*  was saying earlier, basically saying, look, we're not the ones putting tariffs on you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=375.98s)]
*  We're not the ones trying to bully you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=379.98s)]
*  You can rely on us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=381.5s)]
*  And also, don't forget, we are the largest investor in your economy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  We're building you the infrastructure here. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=386.54s)]
*  We're building you railway lines. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=389.18s)]
*  We're building you factories. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=390.82s)]
*  The United States isn't doing that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  That is pretty much Xi Jinping's message. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=394.74s)]
*  It's what he said in Vietnam. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  It's what he's saying here. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=397.26000000000005s)]
*  And it's what he'll say in Cambodia. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  But at the same time, as we just heard from the White House press secretary, she does [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  have a point. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=404.48s)]
*  The American market is pretty important as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=405.48s)]
*  You don't want to be losing the American market. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=407.66s)]
*  That is the number one export market for so many manufacturers here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=410.74s)]
*  And officials will be very, very cognizant of that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=414.9s)]
*  I spoke with the Malaysian trade minister, actually, the other day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=417.78s)]
*  And I asked him, look, if you had to lose one of these trading partners, which one would [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=420.98s)]
*  it be? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=424.46s)]
*  Which one's the most important? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=425.46s)]
*  And he said, we're not choosing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=426.46s)]
*  We can't choose. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=428.38s)]
*  We're balancing these two interests. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=429.38s)]
*  We want to sell to the US. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  But we also want to do business with China. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=432.62s)]
*  That's the position that these countries are in, basically. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=435.5s)]
*  And clearly, given Xi Jinping is here and he's saying all of this, Beijing is acutely [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=439.85999999999996s)]
*  aware of that as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=445.38s)]
*  That's where diplomacy comes in, though, isn't it, Nick, that you need to be able to tread [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  a fine line when you're in a bit of a tight spot? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and Southeast Asian countries are actually pretty good at doing that, to be perfectly [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  honest. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=460.82s)]
*  They like to keep their distance in a diplomatic sense. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=461.82s)]
*  They always say that they will always try and defend their national interests. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=464.46s)]
*  But money talks and Chinese investment over the years, decades now, it is just impossible [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  to imagine Southeast Asia now without Chinese money, without Chinese investment. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=475.58s)]
*  Countries here know that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=481.02s)]
*  Interestingly, and I think this is actually quite emblematic of the situation that countries [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=482.78000000000003s)]
*  are in, that Malaysia's in particularly, last night it was announced that Huawei, the massive [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=486.26s)]
*  Chinese technology company, is going to be building new 5G infrastructure for one of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=491.66s)]
*  the big mobile providers here. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=496.3s)]
*  As well as Ericsson, who currently provides 5G. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=498.66s)]
*  So that means you've got a Western 5G provider, a Chinese 5G provider. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=501.62s)]
*  That's the fine line that countries here are trying to tread. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=506.3s)]
*  Obviously, this trade war is complicating that massively. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7AxFyupgvE&t=509.06s)]
