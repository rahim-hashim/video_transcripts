# Electric cars make up 20% of UK car sales in 2024 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI)
*  There are five years to go until the government will begin to phase out the sale of new petrol [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=0.0s)]
*  and diesel cars in the UK. The car industry is adapting and the majority of new models [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=5.04s)]
*  being put onto the market now have either fully electric or hybrid engines. But last [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=10.3s)]
*  year they made up just 20% of all car sales. Our climate editor Justin Roddatt has been [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=15.58s)]
*  investigating why. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=21.16s)]
*  Just look at the scale of this. Car companies have brought dozens of cars and there are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=23.92s)]
*  miles of track here at Millbrook Proving Ground to put them through their paces. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  The 2025 SMMT event here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=37.2s)]
*  But something's missing isn't it? Have a listen. No roaring engines. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=40.32s)]
*  The only wannabe Clarkson in British journalism is almost certainly here. But here's an interesting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=49.16s)]
*  fact. The car industry has brought 154 models to this show. 103 of them are either fully [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  electric or hybrid. So what's that? Two out of every three? It is a measure of just how [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=62.48s)]
*  invested the industry is in the electric future. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=68.16s)]
*  Mike Hawes is the head of the UK's Society of Motor Industry Manufacturers and Traders. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=72.56s)]
*  You look at the investment the industry has made over the last ten years. It has all been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=79.52s)]
*  in electrification. They're trying not to develop petrol and diesel because they see [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=83.48s)]
*  those coming to a natural end. So the market, the industry is moving towards zero emission [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  vehicles. What we need to make sure is the market follows it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=92.92s)]
*  So take a look at what's on offer. Have a look at this. There are some pretty tasty [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=97.32s)]
*  electric cars on sale here. But lots of us just aren't convinced. So last year 20% of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  cars sold were electric vehicles. Quite a few more were hybrids. But that is still well [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  below the 28% target the government set. So what is the problem? There are still so many [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=114.28s)]
*  people out there who think that EVs don't go far enough, that they're expensive, they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=120.52s)]
*  burst into flames, etc, etc. All those questions are answered these days. But it's a big leap [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=124.48s)]
*  of faith. And the most important thing is to get bums on seats, make sure people can [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=129.24s)]
*  live with these things and they experience them. But it's difficult to persuade people, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=133.4s)]
*  particularly in the current climate. But of course, there is another issue, the price. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=137.04s)]
*  Electric cars have tended to be more expensive than petrol and diesel, but prices are falling. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=142.86s)]
*  Take a look at this little city run around. Sixteen grand it will cost you and it'll do [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=148.28s)]
*  about 165 miles on a charge for a couple of grand more, probably talking more like [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=152.96s)]
*  200 miles. So let's take it for a spin. Let's see what this thing can do. Even if the ticket [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=158.28s)]
*  price is a bit higher than petrol or diesel, on average, an EV driver is reckoned to save [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  hundreds of pounds a year in running costs. And the average range is now around 300 miles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=172.96s)]
*  Got to try. A top of the range EV as well. I've got to say though, I'm a bit nervous [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=179.96s)]
*  about this one. The car industry claims it has spent hundreds of millions of pounds funding [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  the switch over to EVs by selling them here in the UK at discount prices. Now it wants [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  government help. I think that the government needs to put in more incentives really to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=206.42s)]
*  get us out of petrol, diesel cars into electric cars. Make electric cars cheaper, the industry [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=211.42s)]
*  says, by cutting VAT on new EVs and on the costs of public charging. But with so little [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=217.7s)]
*  money to play with, the government is unlikely to do that, which could make the UK's ambitious [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=224.92s)]
*  EV targets hard to achieve. And there is another challenge. Be honest, would you ever switch [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=231.18s)]
*  fully to an electric vehicle? I'm still in the half electric, half petrol, half diesel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  camp. Also, I love sound. I love the noise of a big engine, a pop banging exhaust and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  I love a manual gearbox. It seems the UK is well on the road to fully electric motoring, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  but it may just take a bit longer than the government and the industry was hoping. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdmFDMdoHI&t=259.98s)]
