# Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy. #SnowWhite #Disney #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA)
*  Why have you not seen any advertising for Disney's new Snow White film? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=0.0s)]
*  If you compare it to other live-action princess films like Cinderella, Little Mermaid, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=4.7s)]
*  it's fair to say that the studio has gone pretty low-key when it comes to Snow White, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=9.8s)]
*  who, by the way, is Disney's original princess. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=14.3s)]
*  The European premiere was held at a castle in Segovia in Spain, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=18.1s)]
*  which actually inspired animators in 1937, but hardly any press were invited. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=21.7s)]
*  Instead of a more traditional and high-profile location like London's Leicester Square, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=28.7s)]
*  and it might all have to do with the fact that the film has created quite a bit of controversy since it was announced. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=32.9s)]
*  The debate around the film started in January 2022, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=38.3s)]
*  when actor Peter Dinklage, who has dwarfism, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=41.7s)]
*  said that the decision to retell a story about seven dwarfs living in a cave was backward, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=44.6s)]
*  while other actors with dwarfism weren't happy that Disney was using CGI characters, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=50.7s)]
*  saying that they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=56.0s)]
*  Then there was controversy around the studio's decision to cast Rachel Ziegler, who is Latina, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=59.3s)]
*  as Snow White, who is deemed to be a character with skin as white as snow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=64.7s)]
*  Then Rachel upset some fans when she criticised the original Snow White cartoon, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=70.0s)]
*  calling it extremely dated and joking that the prince literally stalks her, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=75.0s)]
*  referring to the 2025 adaptation as the PC version. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=79.7s)]
*  But it doesn't end there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=83.7s)]
*  Gal Gadot, who plays the Evil Queen, and Rachel Ziegler are rumoured to not be getting on very well, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=84.7s)]
*  because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=89.9s)]
*  The film is set to have another premiere in LA, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=93.9s)]
*  but it will reportedly be smaller than usual for a live-action Disney film. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=96.5s)]
*  So, will you be going to watch Snow White? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDIoIiLM5sA&t=100.80000000000001s)]
