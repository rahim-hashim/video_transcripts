Video Description: The UN's humanitarian chief has said people in Gaza are being subjected to forced starvation by Israel.
 
Tom Fletcher said he believed this had led to a change in the international response to Gaza, in an interview with the BBC.
 
Israel began to allow limited aid into Gaza last week, after an almost three-month blockade had halted the delivery of supplies. It also resumed its military offensive two weeks after imposing the blockade, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
 
Israel said the steps were intended to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza.

# People in Gaza subjected to forced starvation, says top UN official | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA)
*  Hamas officials have told the BBC the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal does not meet the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=0.0s)]
*  group's demands. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=5.4s)]
*  The deal had been put forward by the US and approved by Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=6.68s)]
*  The plan sought a 60-day pause in fighting in exchange for the release of up to 10 living [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=10.18s)]
*  hostages held by Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  But it would have allowed Israeli troops to stay in Gaza, and it did not contain provisions [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=17.32s)]
*  for ending the war for good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=21.12s)]
*  It also didn't include an agreement from Israel to allow hundreds of trucks of aid into Gaza [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=23.06s)]
*  something that had been included in the last ceasefire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=28.68s)]
*  While Hamas deems the latest proposals unsatisfactory, it is understood the group is still discussing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=31.84s)]
*  details with international mediators. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=36.32s)]
*  At the end of the last ceasefire, Benjamin Netanyahu imposed an 11-week-long blockade [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=39.68s)]
*  on all aid entering Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  While Israel is now letting some aid in, it's still far less than the amount aid groups [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=46.04s)]
*  say is needed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Tom Fletcher, the UN official responsible for humanitarian aid, has told the BBC that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=51.64s)]
*  Israel's blockade amounts to a policy of forced starvation and that the world has a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=56.4s)]
*  responsibility to take greater action to get aid in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  He was speaking to our special correspondent, Fergal Keene. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=64.84s)]
*  The chaos and the pity, the desperation that is the legacy when aid is blocked. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=70.84s)]
*  Today the UN's chief of humanitarian affairs, a former British diplomat, told me Israel [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=77.88s)]
*  had forcibly starved Gaza. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=83.28s)]
*  I mean so out loud Israeli ministers have been saying that they want the population [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=85.4s)]
*  of Gaza to be relocated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Is that ethnic cleansing? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=91.68s)]
*  It's the forced removal of a population. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=95.92s)]
*  And in this case by withholding of aid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=96.92s)]
*  Now again, the courts will judge what to call that and I have to pick my words very, very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  carefully. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=104.48s)]
*  I'm a humanitarian, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a politician. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=105.48s)]
*  To be clear, what we are seeing is the forced starvation of the population. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing food sat on the borders and not being allowed in when there is a population [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=112.8s)]
*  on the other side of the border that is starving and we're hearing Israeli ministers say that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=116.64s)]
*  is to put pressure on the population of Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=120.8s)]
*  Now we just want to work. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  We have a plan to deliver, we just want to get in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=126.08s)]
*  That's a war crime isn't it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=128.04s)]
*  If you use food as a weapon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=129.6s)]
*  It is classified as a war crime. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=131.48s)]
*  Obviously these are issues for the courts to take the judgement on and ultimately for [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=133.56s)]
*  history to take a judgement on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=137.16s)]
*  As a humanitarian my interest is just in getting as much of that aid in as possible, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=139.16s)]
*  as quickly as possible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel has claimed that Hamas steals food aid and it accuses the UN of acting like a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=146.64s)]
*  mafia by refusing to cooperate with Israel's military organised aid distribution centres. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=151.44s)]
*  The Israelis say they have to do it their way because Hamas are stealing the aid. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=157.76s)]
*  There's very, very little stealing of aid by Hamas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  Now is some of that aid then getting to market and being stolen by Hamas from market or border [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=168.48s)]
*  market now there's always a risk of that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=172.88s)]
*  In such a complex, contested, militarised environment I don't want to see any of that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=174.88s)]
*  aid getting to Hamas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=180.04s)]
*  That matters to us because these are our principles, neutral, impartiality, independent. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  So it's in our interest to stop that aid getting to Hamas and ensure it gets to civilians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr Fletcher visited Gaza in February while there was still a ceasefire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  In recent days he's come under criticism for stating that 14,000 babies would die in 48 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=198.88s)]
*  hours because of the blockade, a claim the UN has retracted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=204.92s)]
*  Didn't you damage your own case when you talked about 14,000 babies dying within 48 hours? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  Pretty big gaffe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=218.16s)]
*  I think we've got to be very, very careful with our numbers, we've got to be precise [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  and that's a lesson that I've learnt in the last couple of weeks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Are you sorry for that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=226.0s)]
*  I regret that I used that 48 hours because in reality those deaths will take place over [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=228.56s)]
*  a longer time but they are at risk. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  Because when people take that and along with the statement about thousands of trucks lined [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=237.16s)]
*  up on the border not being able to get in, the risk is looking like a hype merchant. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  There is that risk and there is a risk when we're out there using these big numbers and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  they are overwhelming numbers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  You know we've got provisions to fill 10,000 trucks and get them in. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=253.28s)]
*  That can feed everyone in Gaza, all the civilians for several months and that's the real point here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=256.76s)]
*  Mr Fletcher drew international attention when two weeks ago he appealed to the UN Security [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=262.84s)]
*  Council to act to prevent genocide in Gaza, a statement Israel attacked as support for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=268.0s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=273.92s)]
*  But how will history judge how the world responded to the Gaza crisis? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=275.5s)]
*  History will judge us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=280.2s)]
*  I think that history will be tough in the way it judges us and it must be. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=281.76s)]
*  When I went to the Security Council I chose my words very, very carefully and I'm choosing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=289.08s)]
*  them again carefully now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  I wanted to issue a warning to the Security Council that in previous cases, Rwanda, Srebrenica, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=294.28s)]
*  Sri Lanka, the world had told us afterwards that we didn't act in time, that we didn't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=301.56s)]
*  sound the warning and ask that the world respond to prevent genocide. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=306.12s)]
*  And that's my call to the Security Council and to the world right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=312.04s)]
*  Will you act to prevent genocide? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=315.44s)]
*  It's been announced in advance. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=317.64s)]
*  We can't say we didn't know what was happening. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=320.2s)]
*  And all I'm asking is for the international community to be able to say, tell them we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=323.42s)]
*  did what we could. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=328.52s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do and nothing we get thrown at us will stop us doing that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=329.52s)]
*  In the ruins of Gaza, the hunger, the fear, the trauma, the anguish too of Israel's hostages. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=335.92s)]
*  Six hundred and one days of suffering for all in Gaza and more coming. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcFD7pNtqA&t=344.15999999999997s)]
