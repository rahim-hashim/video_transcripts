Video Description: More than 200 Venezuelans, alleged by the White House to be gang members, have been deported from the US to a super maximum-security prison in El Salvador, even as a US judge blocked the removals.
 
A group of 238 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and 23 members of the international MS-13 gang were sent to the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot).
 
Neither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, nor provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.
 
Meanwhile, the White House has denied an accusation from rights groups that it flouted due process by defying a judge's order while carrying out deportations at the weekend.

# US deports hundreds of Venezuelans to supermax prison despite court order | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E)
*  More than 200 Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members have been deported from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. to a supermax prison in El Salvador. A U.S. federal judge has now ruled that similar [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=5.36s)]
*  deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which dates back to the 18th century, should be blocked. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=10.72s)]
*  But according to the White House, the removal from the U.S. had already taken place before that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=16.0s)]
*  ruling. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke about the move on Sunday in an interview with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  our U.S. news partner, CBS. We want to get rid of Tren Daragua gang members. They're terrorists [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=25.2s)]
*  too. The president designated them, asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=30.96s)]
*  We want to get rid of them as well. We don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=36.16s)]
*  is to understand. We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=40.64s)]
*  and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple. Marco Rubio there. Let's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=44.8s)]
*  speak now to Jorge Perez from BBC Mundo. Good to see you. What do we know about who these migrants [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=50.48s)]
*  or gang members, depending on who you're talking to, who they actually are, Jorge? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=57.36s)]
*  Well, these are migrants that have been accused by the authorities in the United States of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=63.68s)]
*  apparently, allegedly, being members of the Tren Daragua, it's a Venezuelan gang organization [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=67.84s)]
*  that was formed in an iconic prison in Venezuela. Then these vans started to spread across the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  region following many of the flows of Venezuelan migrants. Venezuelan migrants are actually the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=80.0s)]
*  main target of this organization. Some of them reached the United States and managed to get into [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=85.52s)]
*  the country. Now the US government is not only considering this organization a terrorist [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=91.6s)]
*  organization, but it's also targeting some of its members, deporting them to El Salvador after an [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=97.44s)]
*  agreement they reached with that government. But the questions for some human rights groups is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=104.8s)]
*  whether the due process was correctly made during this deportation process. Jorge, why is El Salvador [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=111.6s)]
*  taking them? Well, El Salvador is, the government of President Bukele, Nayib Bukele, has been launching [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=119.84s)]
*  a campaign of targeting criminals, grand criminals within El Salvador. Then they built this prison [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=129.84s)]
*  known as Secot in English. That would mean something like terrorist confinement center. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=137.28s)]
*  And they have been targeting and arresting and getting into prison some gang members from El [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=144.96s)]
*  After this, they reached an agreement with the United States to jail some gang or suspicious gang [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=151.68s)]
*  members arrested in the United States and then deported to El Salvador. The US and El Salvador [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=162.16s)]
*  reached this agreement during a visit of the state secretary Marco Rubio in which he met Nayib Bukele, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  the president of El Salvador, and they agreed to do this. El Salvador is expecting to receive from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=174.88s)]
*  the US government around six million dollars a year in order for them to keep these suspected, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=181.44s)]
*  dis-alleged criminals within this prison. But this has raised a lot of concern among human rights [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=189.04s)]
*  groups because, again, some doubt of the due process that was carried out during this deportation [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=196.32s)]
*  process to El Salvador. As we've been speaking to you as well, we have seen some pictures that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  were released by El Salvador of this supermax prison where conditions are extraordinary. Can [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=207.68s)]
*  you just explain what function it serves? How many people are there and what the reports are of life [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=216.0s)]
*  inside the supermax prison? There's a lot of there's a lot of amnesty regarding this prison [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  and a lot of concern from human groups around the world about what is El Salvador really doing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=229.44s)]
*  with this prison. They have even the Salvadorian government has recognized some of the people that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=235.28s)]
*  they have arrested and put into this prison. Some of them were innocent, but then they were released [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=241.2s)]
*  according to El Salvador government. This prison is a way in which the Salvadorian government has [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=247.52s)]
*  managed to control violence within this country. For some people within El Salvador, it has been a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=255.52s)]
*  successful strategy since the criminality and the activity of gang members have actually reduced. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=261.44s)]
*  It's one of the main flagships of the Salvadorian government of Nayib Bukele. But on the other hand, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=269.6s)]
*  there are questions, a lot of questions from human rights groups, whether how's the treatment [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=276.64s)]
*  from the 30s to these people. It is said, for example, that they have to spend 23 hours and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=282.96s)]
*  30 minutes a day within a cell with another within with a lot of other people in the same cell. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=289.2s)]
*  They only have, for example, 30 minutes a day for other activities out of their cells. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's the way the government has responded to the violence in the country, but it now seems to be [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  something that has attracted attention of the U.S. government trying to find an ally in this region, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  in Latin America, where they can actually deport some of the people they are accusing of being [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=319.12s)]
*  criminals or gang members. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  And Jorge, what about the role of Venezuela in this? And this is massive gang that's obviously [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=326.48s)]
*  spread from outside Venezuela if it's found so many of its people now in the U.S. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  What do we know about the gang? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  The gang is known as Tren de Aragua. Tren de Aragua in English means train of Aragua. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=339.44s)]
*  And it took the name from a union in the countryside in Venezuela that was building a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  railroad in the country in the past years. Then they started to function within a prison in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=350.88s)]
*  Venezuela. These were people that were convicted, were sent to a prison years ago. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=358.0s)]
*  And then they started to form a gang from that prison. From that prison, they started to operate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=363.04s)]
*  first targeting people that was within the prison. So they were basically a gang that was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=368.56s)]
*  extorting or asking for money within the prison. But then they started to expand their operations [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=377.28s)]
*  to the towns around this prison. And then they managed to expand those operations [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=383.44s)]
*  throughout Venezuela. What happened after is that after 2013, Venezuela went through a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=390.96s)]
*  horrible economic and social crisis, which made millions of Venezuelans to leave the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=396.8s)]
*  There are right now about 80 million Venezuelans living abroad. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=402.88s)]
*  These gangs started to follow the route and the path, the flows of these Venezuelan migrants. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=406.56s)]
*  And they were targeting the migrants. Then they started to become a sort of multinational, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=413.44s)]
*  international gang organisation operating in countries like Colombia, Chile, Peru. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=418.24s)]
*  And after all, they even managed to cross to the United States. According to the US authorities, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=424.16s)]
*  they have got some of the members of these gangs over there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=431.12s)]
*  Oh, great to talk to you. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-sl6xaA9E&t=434.24s)]
