# Israel launches fresh strikes on Iran after hitting nuclear and military sites | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI)
*  Hello and welcome to Verified Live on a day totally dominated by Israel strikes on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=0.0s)]
*  The magnitude of these attacks are on a completely different scale to what we saw last year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=6.4s)]
*  Israel says they targeted Iran's nuclear programme, claiming it was their very survival that was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  at stake. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=16.84s)]
*  Tehran, though, has described it as an act of war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=17.84s)]
*  Explosions were heard in the capital Tehran and at the Natanz nuclear facility, around [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=21.92s)]
*  200 miles to the south. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=26.64s)]
*  Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders have been killed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=29.56s)]
*  Iran's state TV is reporting that civilians, including children, are among the dead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=33.56s)]
*  The scale of the damage to the nuclear facilities like this in Natanz is not yet clearly known. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=39.2s)]
*  Much of the Iranian programme is carried out deep underground. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=45.44s)]
*  Israel says its military action is continuing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=49.64s)]
*  Its secret service Mossad has taken the rare step of releasing this footage, which it claims [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=52.96s)]
*  was filmed inside Iran, showing its operatives preparing to launch an attack. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=58.32s)]
*  Iran has already retaliated, sending a wave of drones towards Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=64.16s)]
*  Israeli forces say all of them were intercepted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=68.4s)]
*  In the next 60 minutes, we'll bring you the latest reaction from various capitals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=71.88s)]
*  We'll also look at what was hit, who was hit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=76.08s)]
*  We'll also examine the various strategies being carried out by Israel and Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=79.08s)]
*  Let's talk to our correspondents in Jerusalem. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=85.6s)]
*  Ione Wells is there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Our North America correspondent, Nomiye Iqbal, is there at the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=89.56s)]
*  And our political correspondent, Helen Catt, is at Westminster. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  But I want to go straight to the White House and straight to Nomiye, because over the last [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=96.72s)]
*  couple of hours, Nomiye, a number of lines the president has given several interviews. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=101.12s)]
*  What is the general thrust of what Donald Trump is saying? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=107.56s)]
*  To be quite straight with you, it is incredibly confusing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=111.2s)]
*  Initially, we were told by the Trump administration, via the Secretary of State, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=115.88s)]
*  Marco Rubio, that the US was not involved in this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=120.48s)]
*  Mr Rubio really distancing the US from Israel's actions, calling them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=124.0s)]
*  unilateral. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=127.4s)]
*  Donald Trump then appears to have contradicted that, saying a few [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  moments ago that we knew everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=132.8s)]
*  Exactly what they knew, we don't know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=135.16s)]
*  The White House is still saying they didn't green light it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=137.48s)]
*  They may not have officially approved of the attack, but they certainly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=140.56s)]
*  approve of it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=145.44s)]
*  In his social media post, Mr Trump appears to basically be saying to Iran, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=147.04s)]
*  start negotiating, and if you don't, there will be more of this to come. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=152.04s)]
*  I suspect the US is using this as some sort of leverage to push Iran to the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=156.72s)]
*  negotiation table. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=161.72s)]
*  There is an emergency meeting in the US, and the US is not going to be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=163.2s)]
*  doing anything about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=167.36s)]
*  There is an emergency meeting right now being held by President Trump here [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=168.68s)]
*  at the White House with his Cabinet. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=172.32s)]
*  We understand that he will be talking to the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=174.12s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu later this afternoon, but there are also reports [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=177.4s)]
*  that he and Mr Netanyahu were talking yesterday in several phone calls. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  So there is some confusion about exactly what the US knew, how much [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=184.76s)]
*  it is involved in all of this, but I do think looking at the social media [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=189.24s)]
*  posts, he clearly approves of what Israel is doing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=193.52s)]
*  I will return to you in a moment, but let's go to Jerusalem and Ioni [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=196.52s)]
*  Wells. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=201.52s)]
*  Ioni, just in the last few minutes, reports coming in that there are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=202.52s)]
*  multiple blasts that have been heard in Tehran. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=206.0s)]
*  There are also blasts to the west of Tehran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=208.76s)]
*  That fits with what the Israeli authorities and perhaps what Donald [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=211.76s)]
*  Trump was alluding to in his social media post, that this is ongoing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=216.0s)]
*  It is simply the start of things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=220.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=224.28s)]
*  In the last couple of minutes, as you say, Iranian state TV have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=225.28s)]
*  confirmed that they are intercepting missiles over Tehran. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=229.12s)]
*  That doesn't really come as a surprise. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=232.12s)]
*  As you say, it was expected that there would be further escalation in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=234.12s)]
*  this conflict after Israel launched severe strikes last night on Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=238.12s)]
*  I think it's worth just recapping just how much of a devastating shock [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=242.12s)]
*  those strikes were to Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=247.12s)]
*  They came in the middle of the night, attacking some of Iran's most [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=250.96s)]
*  senior military commanders as well as nuclear scientists, more than 200 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=255.96s)]
*  planes striking more than 100 sites in Iran, as well as that Mossad, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=260.96s)]
*  Israel's intelligence agency, launched missiles from inside of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=266.96s)]
*  Iranian territory. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=271.96s)]
*  So it is clear that this was a severe escalation and that attacks [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=272.96s)]
*  are expected to continue between the two sides in the coming hours, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  but also in the coming days. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  One thing that both sides agree on is that this is just the beginning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  The IDF, Israel's military, has said that this is war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  Iran's foreign ministry has described Israel's actions yesterday [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  as a declaration of war, and both sides are expected to continue these [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  attacks, as I say, in the coming days, coming hours. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  That's something which was reiterated, as you mentioned there, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  that the President has been speaking to foreign leaders, including an [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=307.64s)]
*  expected conversation with President Trump, so it may be that we get [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=311.64s)]
*  more indication once those calls are complete about some next steps [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=315.64s)]
*  expected. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=318.64s)]
*  I'll be back to you in a moment or two, but I want to bring in Helen [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=321.64s)]
*  Catt in Westminster, because we were hearing earlier about the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=325.64s)]
*  upcoming phone call between Benjamin Netanyahu and the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=328.64s)]
*  President of the United States. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=331.64s)]
*  We know from the Prime Minister's office, he's also spoken to the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  leaders of Germany, India and France, the obvious omission is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  number 10. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  We know that relations have been strained over recent days, but [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  interesting, no apparent call to Sikhiastama. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  This was brought up at the daily briefing for reporters in Westminster [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  and the Downing Street spokesperson couldn't or wouldn't say whether [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  there had been any call between Sikhiastama and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=362.32s)]
*  Sikhiastama has addressed that since in an interview with Bloomberg. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=366.32s)]
*  He had said that he was planning to call Mr Netanyahu this afternoon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=370.32s)]
*  We don't yet know if that call has taken place. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=374.32s)]
*  But as you said, there's been a real effort among the government here [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=377.32s)]
*  to focus on de-escalation and diplomacy, and specifically working [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=381.32s)]
*  with allies to try and put the pressure on to reach a depression [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=385.32s)]
*  solution. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  There was a call between Sikhiastama this morning and the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  President of France, Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Friedrich Merz. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  In that call, the leaders discussed what were described as their long [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  held grave concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  They called on all sides to refrain from further escalation, which [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  they say could de-stabilise the region. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  The White House has said that the government should not be condemned [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=416.0s)]
*  if it was stopping Iran from getting nuclear weapons. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=420.0s)]
*  That certainly does seem to be the focus from the government here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=424.0s)]
*  I should say there's a slightly different tone coming out from the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=428.0s)]
*  leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=432.0s)]
*  She had declined to say Israel's action as an escalation and instead [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=435.0s)]
*  said it should not be condemned if it was stopping Iran from getting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=439.0s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=443.0s)]
*  He has to say a phrase like that underlines what is at risk here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=445.84s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=453.84s)]
*  Bear in mind, this is a President who has made a big point in his [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=455.84s)]
*  campaigning that he doesn't believe in wars. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=459.84s)]
*  He's a no-war President, he doesn't want any foreign intervention, he [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=462.84s)]
*  wants countries to get on with whatever they want to do, he doesn't [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=466.84s)]
*  want the US intervening. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=470.84s)]
*  The US will support him, his coalition, his base will be split on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=472.84s)]
*  this, they will be thinking, hang on a minute, how much is the US [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=475.84s)]
*  involved in this? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=479.84s)]
*  As we were talking earlier, even though the White House is saying [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=481.84s)]
*  that they didn't officially green like this, it does appear that Donald [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=485.84s)]
*  Trump hugely approves of this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=489.84s)]
*  It is going to be somewhat of a balancing act for him because, of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=491.84s)]
*  course, Israel is the US's greatest ally in the Middle East and they [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=494.84s)]
*  have to protect Israel. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=498.84s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump is very adamant about that, but at the same [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=500.84s)]
*  time has to deliver on that promise that he has constantly made to his [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=504.84s)]
*  supporters about no wars. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=509.84s)]
*  I just want to also add, Matthew, we understand that the Pentagon is [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=511.84s)]
*  now moving US destroyers to the eastern Mediterranean as Israel [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=516.8399999999999s)]
*  obviously braces for that potential retaliation. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  These ships are capable of defending against ballistic and cruise [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=524.84s)]
*  missile attacks. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=528.84s)]
*  They were already in the region, but they are now rerouting because of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=530.84s)]
*  Israel's attack on Iran to provide the US with that extra layer of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=534.84s)]
*  security. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=539.84s)]
*  The US is obviously very concerned about any retaliation on US targets [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=541.84s)]
*  and US personnel and have made it quite clear to Iran that they will [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=545.84s)]
*  not accept that if it happens. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=549.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=551.84s)]
*  Let's head back to Jerusalem and I only wells. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=553.84s)]
*  We were listening to Danny Danon there at the UN a short while ago and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=556.84s)]
*  we will play that clip for viewers in a moment or two. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=560.84s)]
*  He was repeating what the IDF had said to me earlier in the day, which [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=563.84s)]
*  is that Israel perceived that there was a realistic threat imminent. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=567.84s)]
*  That is their position as to why they launched this attack. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=572.84s)]
*  The truth is that over decades Benjamin Netanyahu has wanted to do [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=576.84s)]
*  action like this, isn't it? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=582.84s)]
*  Yes, that is right. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=585.84s)]
*  This is something that Benjamin Netanyahu has been talking about [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=587.84s)]
*  since the 1990s. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=591.84s)]
*  Not just about a threat of nuclear weapons from Iran being imminent, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=593.84s)]
*  but a desire to neutralise them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=597.84s)]
*  It seems that now the Prime Minister felt emboldened to try to do so. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=600.84s)]
*  As you say, Netanyahu shortly after these strikes were made last night [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=605.84s)]
*  said that his justification for this was that Iran had now developed [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=610.84s)]
*  nuclear material sufficient to make nuclear weapons, enough to make nine [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=616.84s)]
*  nuclear bombs. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=621.84s)]
*  Iran has always continuously denied that its nuclear capabilities are [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=623.84s)]
*  for weaponry and said that they are for civilian use only. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=627.84s)]
*  One extra factor this week was that the International Atomic Energy [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=632.84s)]
*  Agency had said that Iran for the first time in 20 years was breaching its [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=638.84s)]
*  anti-proliferation obligations, which is something that has also been [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=643.84s)]
*  cited by the Israelis today. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=647.84s)]
*  Ione, thanks very much. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=650.84s)]
*  I'm going to quickly go back to Westminster because there has been a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=652.84s)]
*  development just as we were having the conversations with our [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=655.84s)]
*  correspondents. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=658.84s)]
*  Helen, there is an update from Downing Street. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=659.84s)]
*  Yes, you were talking about whether or not there had been a call between [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=661.84s)]
*  Keir Starmer and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=665.84s)]
*  We understand that that has now happened, although as you mentioned [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=667.84s)]
*  earlier, quite a long way it would appear down the list of world leaders [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=670.84s)]
*  this afternoon. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=673.84s)]
*  In that, we're told that Keir Starmer said that he recognised that Israel [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=674.84s)]
*  had a clear right to self-defence, he was clear that Israel had a right to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=681.84s)]
*  self-defence, sorry, and that he again expressed his grave concerns about [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=685.84s)]
*  Israel's nuclear programme. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=688.84s)]
*  Helen Catt there at Westminster, thanks very much and thanks to Ione Wells [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=690.84s)]
*  and thanks to Nomi Iqbal at the White House. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=695.84s)]
*  Plenty more on that, our main story coming up in a moment or two, but [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=698.84s)]
*  around the world and across the UK, you're watching BBC News. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxRZWGRaMzI&t=701.84s)]
