# South Korea floods leave multiple people dead after torrential rain â€“ BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0)
*  While in South Korea, the army there has been called in to help rescue efforts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=0.0s)]
*  After deadly floods and landslides were triggered by torrential rain, at least 24 people have died [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=5.04s)]
*  and 10 others are missing. Crops and roads have been swept away and most trains have been suspended, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=12.4s)]
*  whilst 13 cities have reported electricity blackouts. South Korea is used to heavy rains [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=19.04s)]
*  in the monsoon season, but over the last few years these have become more intense as a result of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=24.56s)]
*  rising temperatures. For more on this, let's speak to our reporter who is in Seoul, David Oh. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  And David, lovely to have you. How is the situation at the moment? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=37.36s)]
*  As you mentioned, the heavy rain continues throughout this weekend in South Korea and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=44.4s)]
*  especially in the central and southern part of Korea. Reports say there have been up to 100 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=49.04s)]
*  mm per hour of torrential rains and that's quite a significant number, especially given the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=55.28s)]
*  situation in certain parts of the region. This morning, the report said about five houses collapsed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=61.28s)]
*  due to landslides in Yeongcheon, North Gyeongsang Province, which is about 200 km south from Seoul. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  And I'm just checking the numbers and as of 5pm, according to South Korean authorities, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=77.84s)]
*  there have been more than 20 people died and nine are still missing and caused by these heavy rains. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  And it looks like the weather forecast says there will be a lot more rains coming in this weekend, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=94.08s)]
*  also possibly next week. So it makes it difficult for the rescue operation to find missing people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=100.24s)]
*  David, often when we hear about flooding incidents like this, brought on by unprecedented rainfall, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=109.6s)]
*  it's often exacerbated, number one, by the geography, the physical geography, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=116.4s)]
*  being where this rain is falling. And secondly, also materials, for example, that the homes are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=121.44s)]
*  built from. Where this rain and this flooding is taking place, is any of that relevant? Any of those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=127.12s)]
*  factors relevant? It's quite difficult to say at the moment whether it's linked to, as we mentioned, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=133.52s)]
*  certain factors. But this week, the heavy rains continued for at least five days, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  which is quite unusual. And also the timing of rains became more quicker. And it used to be, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=149.28s)]
*  in summertime, South Korea is expecting to have the monsoon season, especially during the monsoon [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=155.76s)]
*  season, for heavy rains and torrential rains. But the timing came a bit earlier than we expected. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=160.56s)]
*  So it's quite difficult to say, but there are still quite strict warnings coming in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=166.72s)]
*  And it should be set on alarm for South Korean authorities. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=172.56s)]
*  David, in terms of, we spoke to you earlier and you have said, you know, it's difficult to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=176.72s)]
*  attribute this specifically to climate change. But in general, the South Korean government, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=182.0s)]
*  what have they done to mitigate events like this? Or how are they themselves? What's their approach [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=187.2s)]
*  to climatic change incidents, like flooding, like excessive heat? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=192.16s)]
*  Last year, there has been a quite significant casualty caused by heavy rains and flood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=198.8s)]
*  So the Western South City government has set up a plan to have, especially the houses where there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=204.72s)]
*  are underground houses. I'm not sure what exact figures, but there's a significant number of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=214.48s)]
*  houses that have underground houses, underground rooms, especially for young people who haven't got [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  enough money to find houses. So they have set up a plan to have these youngsters to find new [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  settlements. Luckily, this type of rain this week wasn't caused many damage in Seoul. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=234.24s)]
*  But we are not sure whether it's coming to Seoul or other areas causing other casualties. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  It's not really difficult to say at the moment. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=250.08s)]
*  Okay, David Oh, live from Seoul. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWuBMkW3Vq0&t=253.28s)]
