**BBC - The Latest:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived in the US. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump since he returned to the White House two weeks ago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=4.0s)]
*  First up, though, a meeting with the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, later today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=9.0s)]
*  The trip comes at a pivotal time for the Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=13.0s)]
*  Talks are supposed to start on moving from the initial six-week stage to the second phase. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, let's go to our correspondent, Joe Inwood, who's in Jerusalem for us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=23.0s)]
*  Joe, hello to you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=26.0s)]
*  First of all, talk to us about the significance of Benjamin Netanyahu being in the US. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, he was very keen to emphasize the importance of it as he got on a flight here in Israel yesterday, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=33.0s)]
*  saying it signified not just the close relationship between the two countries, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=39.0s)]
*  but his personal friendship with President Donald Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=42.0s)]
*  Of course, there are talks taking place tomorrow that he's expected in the White House, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=45.0s)]
*  and he was talking about the many subjects they're going to be discussing, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=50.0s)]
*  most of them based around security, and he said expanding the ring of peace, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=53.0s)]
*  as he called it in the region, through strength. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=57.0s)]
*  So he's very keen to emphasize the closeness of their relationship [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=60.0s)]
*  and the topics they're going to be discussing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=64.0s)]
*  But as you were mentioning, the meeting I think people are really focused on today [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=66.0s)]
*  is the one that's taking place with Steve Witkoff. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=70.0s)]
*  Now, he is the US special envoy to the Middle East, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=72.0s)]
*  and it's expected that talks around the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=75.0s)]
*  are going to be on the agenda. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=80.0s)]
*  And that is really important, because stage one has been holding so far, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=82.0s)]
*  and the peace talks are supposed to, or the talks are supposed to, start again today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=86.0s)]
*  And what they're going to be trying to hammer out is how they can move on from phase one, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=90.0s)]
*  which is seeing 33 hostages released and peace for 42 days, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=94.0s)]
*  how they can move on to stage two. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=98.0s)]
*  Now, this is much more tricky, because it would see not just the release [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=100.0s)]
*  of all the remaining living hostages, many of whom are soldiers, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=104.0s)]
*  but also what's called a sustainable calm in the jargon, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=108.0s)]
*  what they really mean is a permanent end to the fighting, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=111.0s)]
*  and that's going to be a much more difficult thing to discuss. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=114.0s)]
*  And briefly, Joe, what are you hearing about those negotiations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=116.0s)]
*  around this tricky second phase from within the region? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=120.0s)]
*  So the Qataris, they're the key mediators, or one of the key mediators in this, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=125.0s)]
*  came out yesterday and said that neither side had come forward [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=129.0s)]
*  to start the negotiations yet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=132.0s)]
*  We have heard in the last short while from the AFP agency [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=134.0s)]
*  that Hamas have said they're ready to start negotiations again, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=137.0s)]
*  and the Israelis, well, they're over there, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=141.0s)]
*  and maybe for them discussing this with the Americans, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=143.0s)]
*  it is part of hammering out the next part of this deal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=145.0s)]
*  OK, Joe, thank you very much. Joe Inwood. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZikLPXcoeU&t=149.0s)]
