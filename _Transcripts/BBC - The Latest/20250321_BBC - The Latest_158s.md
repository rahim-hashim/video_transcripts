Video Description: Israel's top court has issued an injunction to prevent the head of the nation's security service from being fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
The Shin Bet is Israel's domestic intelligence agency and plays a key role in the war. Its activities and membership are closely-held state secrets.
 
The Israeli cabinet formally approved the early dismissal of Ronen Bar on Thursday night, over the failure to anticipate the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas.
 
Netanyahu said last week that he intended to sack Mr Bar, citing an "ongoing distrust" between the two that had "grown over time".
 
It would be the first time in Israel's history that a government has fired the Shin Bet's leader.
 
On Friday, the Supreme Court froze the dismissal until a hearing could be heard on the matter no later than 8 April, according to documents cited in Israeli media.
