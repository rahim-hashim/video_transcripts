Video Description: On 10 October 1957, a nuclear reactor at a facility in Cumbria caught fire and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.

It was one of the world's first nuclear disaster, and the UK's worst - but few are aware of it.

BBC Newsbeat spoke to the CEO of Rebellion, the studio behind Atomfall, about how Windscale inspired them and the impact game subscription services are having on smaller developers.

# Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo)
*  It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants to emerge or mutants or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=0.0s)]
*  ferals. But it was very serious and we just thought it was an interesting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=7.44s)]
*  spin-off point for sort of alternate fiction. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  My name is Jason Kingsley. I'm the CEO and creator, director and co-founder of Rebellion. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=21.2s)]
*  Hi, I'm Ben Fisher. I'm head of design at Rebellion and I acted as creative director, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=25.68s)]
*  I suppose, on Atomfall. So I helped bring the ideas together and bring the whole project into [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=30.8s)]
*  land. Obviously we're here today to talk about Atomfall. It's probably helpful, particularly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=35.28s)]
*  for some of our listeners who aren't massive gamers. Just if you gave us the sort of elevator [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=40.0s)]
*  pitch for Atomfall, what kind of game is it and what's sort of notable about it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Atomfall is a survival action game set in a quarantine zone in 1950s, 1960s England. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=51.2s)]
*  The player wakes up, they don't know who they are and the core of the game is investigating [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=57.84s)]
*  sort of in a detective fashion to uncover what the mystery is that triggered a quarantine zone [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=63.84s)]
*  around the Windskill plant. The world's first major nuclear disaster in 1957, the fire in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=68.72s)]
*  Windskill plant was triggered by what was later uncovered to be generational plutonium for bombs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=76.08s)]
*  What we thought would be interesting was to take that as a sort of trigger point for a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=85.2s)]
*  fictionalized version of the disaster and to tell a kind of period, sci-fi period, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=88.8s)]
*  speculative fiction story where the player uncovers what that mystery is and what it means. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=96.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was a proper disaster but it didn't cause strange glowing plants to emerge or [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=100.56s)]
*  mutants or ferals or dangerous cults but it was very serious and we just thought it was an [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=108.16s)]
*  interesting spin-off point for sort of alternate fiction and very strongly based on the sort of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=114.8s)]
*  British style science fiction works of the time. So your own Doctor Who and your own Quatermass [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=121.92s)]
*  experience for a big part of it and lots of classic books that are well worth reading even [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=129.76s)]
*  today like Dave the Triffids or John Wyndham's The Chrysalids, that kind of thing. The Windskill [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=134.72s)]
*  plant, I must confess actually, it wasn't something that I was very familiar with and from speaking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=141.2s)]
*  to people I don't think many people are actually seems to have faded from the memory a bit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  I guess obviously when you're making a game you went up to the local area and what have you, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=152.0s)]
*  is there much of a kind of legacy of the fire up there to people up there still remember it? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=156.4s)]
*  I don't think so. I went up there long before the game was actually kicked off at Rebellion [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=162.56s)]
*  and went there with my partner taking photographs and of course there is an active nuclear power [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  station there, it's called Sellafield. There are people that work there, we've had people in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=170.8s)]
*  comments and social media saying oh I work at the Sellafield power plant, I'm really looking [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  forward to playing this game which is a bit weird because you know that's sort of quite meta and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=179.28s)]
*  people from what was called Cumberland there, which isn't called Cumberland anymore, you know [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=185.44s)]
*  I went up the coast there, it's absolutely beautiful but quite bleak, beautiful parts of the world and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  then of course if you go slightly inland you get to the Lake District and yeah there've been all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=195.52s)]
*  sorts of typically British comments about it's just another weekend in the north of England kind [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=200.88s)]
*  of sarcastic comments about people but obviously we turn it up to well beyond 11 actually. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=207.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah even the hairiest of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Knights out in a British provincial town centre would struggle to match some of the things you see [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  in Attenfall I'm sure but yeah just on the Lake District setting as well that's something that has [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=223.04s)]
*  got a lot of attention actually and how did you go about rendering that into a game form? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=229.44s)]
*  We sent teams up there to do what's called photogrammetry where we take [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  hundreds sometimes thousands of photographs of places and objects and things with permission [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=242.56s)]
*  and then sort of render them into a 3D form but Ben can tell us a bit more about that because the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  team went up there and wandered around because we have quite a varied team from different [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  backgrounds so got people from all sorts of parts of the world so for people that live in Britain [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=257.84s)]
*  you're probably more familiar with the Lake District than people that come from France or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=263.68s)]
*  you know from America so I think for a lot of them Ben they all seem to have fun up there [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=268.24s)]
*  didn't they? Yeah absolutely I mean there are things that as locals it's easy for us to forget [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=273.04s)]
*  are like unique to Britain that are unusual so having those varied perspectives on what stands [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=278.88s)]
*  out really really helped including things like the sort of lead artist on the project is from [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=285.68s)]
*  Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls so you know it was fun to make sure we capture those [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=292.32s)]
*  local details like that and to make sure we had tools that could generate dry stone walls so we [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=299.52s)]
*  could build them in the game part of the process was making sure we had a toolkit to let us build [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=304.56s)]
*  a kind of an accurate slightly kind of theme parkish version of the environment but yeah having [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=309.52s)]
*  having dry stone walls in the game that are older than America itself was all part of the fun. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=315.52s)]
*  Good bit of transatlantic banter there I'm sure and it's really interesting you had international [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=320.16s)]
*  members of the team on there because I was looking back and I think you know at and fall [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=326.48s)]
*  there's quite a buzz around it people they're excited to get their hands on it I think and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=330.24s)]
*  I think the setting does have a part to play in that and there don't seem to be a huge number of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to say high profile games that are set outside London and well first of all I wondered [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=339.12s)]
*  did you have any thoughts on why that might be the case? I think possibly because a lot of the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=346.08s)]
*  bigger companies that fund games you know the studios if you like like the movie studios [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=350.4s)]
*  the game studios are largely US based or they're Japanese or you know that there aren't that many [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=355.68s)]
*  well I don't think there are any big games publishers in the UK specifically and the UK [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  I think to understand certain aspects of our culture you kind of you've got to dig into it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot and we also have a very different for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=374.16s)]
*  example gun culture is very different in this country than it is over in the states and guns [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=379.6s)]
*  feature heavily in a lot of games not all of them of course but in a lot of them so there's a natural [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=384.72s)]
*  tendency to want to go down that route I think for simplicity so no I just think it's one of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  those things though that I bet you there are a few more that start to turn up as a result of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Atomfall's success so I think it's quite likely people will look at our heritage a little bit. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=401.52s)]
*  The real kind of creative challenges we set for ourselves was to lean into those specific [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=406.96s)]
*  regional differences meaning you know region meaning UK but also meaning not London so like [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=411.76s)]
*  Jason was saying leaning away from making the game feel like a shooter and expressions yeah [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  and expressions as well Ben because you know we've got the certain gesticulations that characters [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  the enemies will make to you which are very British which some people will know of as quite [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=430.48s)]
*  rude and sort of you know expressions like off which again means slightly different things in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  places like America and America the US is a huge market of course it's about 40 percent of the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=444.88s)]
*  games market overall but we wanted to introduce them to some of the more salty expressions that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=449.04s)]
*  the Brits will use from time to time. I look forward to lots of American gamers telling people [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=455.28s)]
*  to bugger off I think but yeah and on the point you're making I guess on that international [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=460.08s)]
*  appeal and there being a sort of understandable focus on the USA because it is such a huge market [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  and I think a lot of the big players are based there do you think it would Rebellion would have [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=474.08s)]
*  had as easy a time getting this game commissioned if it didn't have the independence that it does? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=478.0s)]
*  Gosh that's an interesting thought yes I think so yeah I mean we have the luck to be fully [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=484.32s)]
*  independent the company's owned by me and my brother we don't have any investors we don't [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=489.92s)]
*  have any external shareholders so it's just us and we're gamers we like games we like kind of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=493.12s)]
*  creativity YouTube that kind of thing and so really the games we make are the sort of games [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=498.8s)]
*  we want to play and that seems to work quite commercially well there's something there's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=505.36s)]
*  always a tension between creative pressures when you're making something whatever it might be in a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=510.72s)]
*  tv show or a movie or a big big game with the sort of senior management at the funding structure [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=516.88s)]
*  and that can cause great things to be made but it can also cause disasters quite frankly sometimes [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=524.88s)]
*  as we all know so we are we're very lucky to self-fund and we we do it from start to finish [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=530.32s)]
*  all the way up so I'm not sure we're unique in the world but we're pretty close to being unique [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=537.44s)]
*  in the world being being able to do that yeah I don't know of any other game company that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  operates in the same way and I think it's fantastic it's very freeing I genuinely believe that if you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  started with a blank piece of paper you wouldn't end up with an atom ball it's part of our kind of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=553.36s)]
*  unique creative process and all of the most interesting stuff in the game emerged over time [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=559.44s)]
*  how do you kind of sense check the ideas that you and your brother have assuming that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=565.2s)]
*  from what I understand atomfall was kind of quite a passion project for yourself Jason is there a way [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=571.12s)]
*  that you yeah just sort of sense check your ideas make sure that they are kind of gelling with the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=577.76s)]
*  rest of the team and people are being carried along with what the boss wants when you're [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=583.92s)]
*  discussing a project and everybody leans forward and is sort of sparking ideas and coming up with [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=588.8s)]
*  new ideas rather than going well I think that's a terrible idea I mean that would be a rude thing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=594.08s)]
*  to say in a meeting but we'd also encourage it it has been said and sometimes we will overrule it but [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  generally speaking I think you can tell by the engagement of the team and a game like atomfall is [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=609.76s)]
*  made by a big team of talented people from the most experienced all the way down to juniors and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  you know every single discipline plays an important role in it and what we try to do is we try to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=622.4000000000001s)]
*  encourage people to give us feedback on things we may not agree with that feedback we want to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  try and encourage an environment where people can be self-critical as well and and generally I think [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  it's something that Chris and I have developed over the years is a sort of sense that if we like [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=641.44s)]
*  this game there's a fair chance quite a lot of other people will as well so we don't do much in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  the way of market analysis or or data grinding to try to work out how to make a game fun because [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=650.88s)]
*  it's a little bit like saying how do you how do you make a good movie how do you make a great tv [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=659.28s)]
*  show or a great podcast or a good youtube channel it's quite hard to write it down afterwards you [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=664.32s)]
*  sort of have to you have to have the passion you have to go with the flow and try and modify and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=670.4s)]
*  add to it I mean Ben you you've been at the sort of deep end really in terms of getting this across [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=676.32s)]
*  the line and it in its early days it did sort of wander in lots of different directions but we [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  finally grabbed the game and realized what was fun after probably a couple of years worth of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  prototyping to get here that's part of the process really that rebellion games have a consistent set [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=691.6s)]
*  of creative pillars that they tend to drive towards you know you know mostly inspired by [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=699.2s)]
*  Jason and Chris what you prefer and it means that the audience expects that and it means that people [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=704.72s)]
*  are attracted to those sorts of games so all lines up perfectly and then the creative process is [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=709.36s)]
*  finding the best solutions where you've got a theme that you want to explore a set of creative [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=713.76s)]
*  pillars that you want to express and you try things and you see what works and improve and iterate over [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  time Atomfall is going to debut on Game Pass and there was a report recently from the Entertainment [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=723.84s)]
*  Retail Association I think I've got that right saying that subscription services were one of the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=732.08s)]
*  big sort of growth areas in gaming and I suppose the question is are services like Game Pass becoming [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  more important to companies whether that's rebellion or sort of more industry-wide and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  what do you make of comments that some people make about it putting people off paying for games [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  proper? I think it's all complementary actually and one of the things we've noticed when we do [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=755.36s)]
*  a Game Pass deal and Atomfall is available day one on Game Pass. What actually happens is people [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=759.92s)]
*  have heard of the game it's low risk to try it they realize they really like it they tell their [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=767.04s)]
*  friends some of their friends don't have Game Pass but still want to play the game they go out [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=773.52s)]
*  and buy it so you actually get a sort of positive reinforcement effect for the game so back in the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=778.0799999999999s)]
*  old days you used to have game demos I don't know whether anybody in the call is old enough to know [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=785.12s)]
*  to remember magazines with cover mount demos and things but there's a low cost to the player [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=789.68s)]
*  to have a go at trying it and I think that's hugely good for creativity because it also means [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=796.56s)]
*  games that don't have massive marketing budgets can get to millions of eyeballs and can potentially [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=803.76s)]
*  rise above the commercial restrictions that they might have so I think they're great [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=810.8s)]
*  and they're very useful for us you've obviously got to have a good relationship with the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=818.08s)]
*  with the vendors like Sony and Microsoft but ultimately if you make good games then that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  good relationship is going to build anyway over time. I suppose on that point really you mentioned [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Atomfall I guess with it being a new IP for Rebellion and games industry at the moment it [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=835.2s)]
*  feels like launching a kind of brand new IP in a mould that you may be not so known for [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=842.0s)]
*  almost seems heretical at the moment doesn't it because people are so risk averse did does [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=849.2s)]
*  Atomfall ever feel like a risk for the company or yeah and is that something that you think [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=853.12s)]
*  more companies maybe should be doing taking a bit more of a chance on something? I wouldn't want to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=862.32s)]
*  suggest what other companies should do they can they can they can sail their own boat if you like [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=866.4s)]
*  they want to do whatever they want good luck to them. I don't think making new games is risky [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=870.32s)]
*  I think the opposite I think not making new games is the most risk in the end we do sequels you know [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  Sniper Elite Resistance is out and that's a sort of a follow-up to the last Sniper Elite game we [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=883.36s)]
*  did and that's done very very well but people also want new games as well and I think especially as [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=888.88s)]
*  an independent developer like us we can afford to risk flinging the odd new concept out there the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=895.6s)]
*  odd the odd game that perhaps might not be greenlit by a big organization because there isn't enough [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  data around it so I think um I think we should I think in a proper independent games development [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=909.84s)]
*  studio like Rebellion I think we try to keep a balance of sequels proven things that are proven [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=918.64s)]
*  hits and things that we need to innovate with because we've got we've got a lot of creative [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=924.24s)]
*  people and we've got to keep them going as well and um and I don't want to just be making games [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=928.8s)]
*  that are rinse and repeat games I want to be pushing the art form because making games is an [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=933.76s)]
*  art form as well as commercial art form I want to keep doing things um that that keep us awake at [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=939.12s)]
*  night sometimes with worrying whether people will get it and I think that that's motivating for the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=945.52s)]
*  creative process. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-tDORR8Fo&t=954.16s)]
