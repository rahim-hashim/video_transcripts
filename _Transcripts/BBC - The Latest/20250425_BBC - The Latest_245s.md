Video Description: Pakistan’s defence minister has told the BBC that India's threat to halt the flow of water from Indian-administered Kashmir would be "an act of war". 
 
Speaking to Azadeh Moshiri in Islamabad, Khawaja Muhammad Asif said: "It will be a declaration of war, you know, you are actually depriving us of water, which is our right, which was acknowledged by India, as it is written in that treaty. We want that treaty to stay alive."
 
It comes after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's deadly attack in Kashmir in which 26 people died.
 
Mr Asif denied Pakistan was involved in the attack in Pahalgam. 

The suspension of the water treaty is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism - a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi.

The treaty allocated the three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – to Pakistan.

# India threat to halt water from Kashmir would be "act of war", Pakistan minister says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs)
*  Pakistan says it will regard any attempt by India to limit its water supply as an act of war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tensions between the two countries are escalating following the killing of 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir on Tuesday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=7.0s)]
*  Indian police say two of the four gunmen were Pakistani citizens. Pakistan says it had no involvement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, Pakistan's defence minister has denied his country was involved in the deadly attacks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=23.0s)]
*  We were speaking to our correspondent, Azadeh Mushiri, in Islamabad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=28.0s)]
*  We are just responding to what India has done in the last 24 hours. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=33.0s)]
*  We cannot just take it lying down. We have to respond in the same manner, in the same language. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=39.0s)]
*  And so, from your perspective, this is still essentially diplomatic tit-for-tat. There's no escalation yet? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=46.0s)]
*  I hope not. But what it looks like, that this situation can escalate, you know. There is a possibility of escalation also. I hope not. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=53.0s)]
*  But so, if that's a possibility, what is Pakistan's military doing to prepare itself for any possible conflict? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=65.0s)]
*  We are already prepared, you know. We don't have to prepare ourselves. We are already prepared for any eventuality, you know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=70.0s)]
*  And I want to give you an opportunity to address some of the claims that are being made by India. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=76.0s)]
*  They are accusing Pakistan of arming or providing financial support to militant groups on Pakistani soil that operate in Kashmir. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=81.0s)]
*  What is Pakistan's response to this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=91.0s)]
*  We do not have any connection to what is happening in Kashmir. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=93.0s)]
*  The people of Kashmir are subject to brutal occupation for the last 76 years now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=98.0s)]
*  And recently, their constitutional status also was taken away from them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=106.0s)]
*  Do you view Pakistan as having any responsibility to contain or monitor any militant groups who may be planning attacks on Pakistani soil? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=111.0s)]
*  No, let me explain. The infiltration into India from Pakistan's side is just impossible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=120.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=127.0s)]
*  Because of the control line. The two armies are there, not in hundreds of thousands, they are there in hundreds of thousands on both sides. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=128.0s)]
*  Despite the history of attacks that have taken place in Kashmir by militant groups that were based on Pakistani soil, they are not active. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=137.0s)]
*  They are redundant and they are like... [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=147.0s)]
*  What does redundant mean? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=151.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they are inactive, they have become extinct. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=153.0s)]
*  But do you therefore think that any sort of US bounties that are on anyone's heads or someone like Hafiz Sayeed, you believe that these are just outdated? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=159.0s)]
*  They are outdated. They are outdated, they are part of the archives. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=167.0s)]
*  That the US should get rid of it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=171.0s)]
*  Yeah, they are part of the archives now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=172.0s)]
*  Indian police have now published notices claiming that two Pakistani nationals were involved in this attack. What do you know about it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=175.0s)]
*  We have absolutely no knowledge about it. In the last 48 hours there was nothing of the sort on the Indian media. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=186.0s)]
*  But if they have cooked up some story, I'm not aware of it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=194.0s)]
*  The Landmark Water Treaty. Has Pakistan reached out to the World Bank or anyone else for any mediation? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=201.0s)]
*  So is that your red line? Because the statement said that any attempt to halt or to... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=221.0s)]
*  ...depriving us of water, which is our right, which was acknowledged by India as it is written in that treaty. We want that treaty to stay alive. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlDGVv1_Hs&t=231.0s)]
