Video Description: A 42-year-old mining boss from Lesotho named 'Tiger' - real name James Neo Tshoaeli - has evaded a South Africa police manhunt for the past four months.
 
Detained after being accused of controlling the illegal operations at an abandoned gold mine near Stilfontein in South Africa, where 78 corpses were discovered underground in January, Tiger escaped custody, police claim.
 
Four policemen, alleged to have aided his breakout, are out on bail and awaiting trial, but the authorities appear no closer to learning the fugitive's whereabouts.
 
The BBC went to Lesotho to find out more about this elusive man and to hear from those affected by the subterranean deaths.

# Searching for South Africa’s alleged illegal mining boss ‘Tiger’ | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA)
*  The dangers of illegal mining operations in South Africa came to the world's attention earlier this year, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=0.0s)]
*  when more than 200 people working in an unlicensed pit had to be rescued. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=6.0s)]
*  But attempts to bring the alleged kingpin behind the operation to justice remain frustrated, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=11.0s)]
*  as the main suspect, known as Tiger, is on the run. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=17.0s)]
*  And that is despite four police officers being arrested in connection with his disappearance. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=20.0s)]
*  Our Africa correspondent, Maeni Jones, has been to Lesotho, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=25.0s)]
*  the landlocked country where the man called Tiger comes from, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=28.0s)]
*  and from where many of the workers in the illegal mines live. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=32.0s)]
*  To search for him, she sent this report. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=35.0s)]
*  Pristine and majestic, the mountains of Lesotho have long been admired for their beauty. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=40.0s)]
*  But they are also home to many of the illegal miners who recently died at the Stilfontaine mine in South Africa. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=47.0s)]
*  In January, following a months-long standoff between illegal miners and the police, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=54.0s)]
*  over 200 men were pulled out alive from a disused mine in the town of Stilfontaine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=59.0s)]
*  Dozens of bodies were also recovered. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=64.0s)]
*  According to the authorities, a large number of the miners were from Lesotho. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=67.0s)]
*  This is one of the most remote and poorest parts of Lesotho. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=73.0s)]
*  Getting here took us several hours across bad roads. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=76.0s)]
*  And there isn't much to do here, just subsistence farming. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=80.0s)]
*  So some young men feel that they have to go abroad to make a living. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=83.0s)]
*  Men like Supang, he decided to work in illegal mining three years ago [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=87.0s)]
*  and was one of those who passed away in Stilfontaine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=91.0s)]
*  His family says he died from lack of food and medication. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=94.0s)]
*  He left the village to try and find food for his family [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=100.0s)]
*  and to save money to build a roof on his house. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=103.0s)]
*  How does it make you feel to think about him down in that mine [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=107.0s)]
*  for months without food or medication? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=110.0s)]
*  It makes us really sad. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=114.0s)]
*  We don't think the South African government handled the situation well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=116.0s)]
*  They should have tried other ways to arrest the miners. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=120.0s)]
*  This situation has destroyed our family. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=123.0s)]
*  On the other side of the country is the home of Tiger. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=127.0s)]
*  The man South African authorities claim was the ringleader of the Stilfontaine mine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=130.0s)]
*  His friends and family deny this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=134.0s)]
*  He's escaped custody and is now on the run. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=136.0s)]
*  I've come to meet his family. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=139.0s)]
*  His mum, Mampo Swaedi, hasn't seen her son, Neo, aka Tiger, in 80 years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=143.0s)]
*  How does it make you feel to hear that people are writing that about him [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=149.0s)]
*  in newspapers in South Africa, that he's a criminal? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=152.0s)]
*  It really hurts me a lot. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=156.0s)]
*  I think maybe he will die there, or maybe he has died already. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=158.0s)]
*  Or if he survives and eventually comes home, maybe I'll already have died. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=162.0s)]
*  Four police officers have been charged with helping Tiger escape custody. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=169.0s)]
*  The police say several illegal miners described Tiger [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=173.0s)]
*  as one of the Stilfontaine ringleaders [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=176.0s)]
*  and accused him of being responsible for some deaths, assaults and torture. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=178.0s)]
*  Supang's family were recently able to bury him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=183.0s)]
*  Unless Lesotho can find ways to stop its men from seeking their fortune across the border, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=186.0s)]
*  more families may have to experience what they've been through. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvMXOrUGcA&t=191.0s)]
