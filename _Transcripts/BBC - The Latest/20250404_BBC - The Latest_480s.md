# Hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs)
*  I'm here at a secret Nintendo event in Paris, getting a hands-on on the Nintendo Switch 2, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=0.0s)]
*  two months before it goes to the public, and here's what I reckon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=6.0s)]
*  Okay, here's the big moment, the actual Switch 2. What does it look like and what does it feel like? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=10.0s)]
*  It feels good. I mean, it feels nice, gentle in the hands. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=14.0s)]
*  It feels, to be honest with you, a lot like the Switch does, which seems to be the big message Nintendo is sending. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=17.0s)]
*  It's a Switch, but better, a bit bigger, a bit more powerful. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=21.0s)]
*  And when you're actually looking at it, what's new about this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=24.0s)]
*  Not much, right? I mean, if you look at this, you'd be thinking, isn't that just a Switch? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=28.0s)]
*  The only telltale sign to Switch 2, really, is it's got this C button here, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=32.0s)]
*  which has some kind of chat functionality. We don't know too much more about it yet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=37.0s)]
*  If you actually look on the bottom, you've got the USB-C port, as with the original Switch. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=40.0s)]
*  But on the top, you've got a USB-C port here as well. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=45.0s)]
*  We actually know what Nintendo want you to use this thing for now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=48.0s)]
*  They've got the camera plugged into it when you're doing the chat functionality. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=51.0s)]
*  We've got a stand right here on the bottom, which comes out, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=55.0s)]
*  and I'm watching light nods from those around me saying, yes, I am allowed to do this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=58.0s)]
*  The stand, much bigger than the one on the original Switch, obviously, because it's going to be sturdier. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=63.0s)]
*  Clearly, that's a benefit in kind. But otherwise, very similar stuff. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=67.0s)]
*  OK, OK, OK, so that's the console. We all know we're here for, though, right? It's the games. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=71.0s)]
*  How do they play? How do they look? Here's what I reckon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=76.0s)]
*  Let me check out Mario Kart World. This thing is visually beautiful. It looks so good. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=78.0s)]
*  The big, expansive worlds. Everything in there looks amazing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=84.0s)]
*  But of course, there is a big topic, isn't there? The price. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=88.0s)]
*  As much as the games look good, as much as the games play good, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=92.0s)]
*  it all comes down to pennies and pounds, dollars and cents, yen and, well, yen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=95.0s)]
*  And this thing is not cheap. There's no question. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=101.0s)]
*  Maybe the console itself, if you compare to other consoles on the market [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=104.0s)]
*  and the way prices have been going, the console itself seems to be perhaps more reasonable. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=110.0s)]
*  But the actual price of the games are pushing the boundary. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=115.0s)]
*  If you'd like a physical edition of Mario Kart World, you're going to have to part with £75 of your own money. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=119.0s)]
*  I mean, that is really higher than games that we've seen go before. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=126.0s)]
*  Of course, that's not the only way of buying that game. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=130.0s)]
*  But it does also raise a question as to whether Nintendo is perhaps confusing the market just a little bit, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=132.0s)]
*  because there's actually lots of different prices you can pay for the same games. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=138.0s)]
*  Let me explain. So you can get a physical copy of Mario Kart World for £74.99, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=141.0s)]
*  or a digital copy is £66.99. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=146.0s)]
*  But if you get it bundled with the Switch 2 console, and let's be fair, I think most people probably will, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=149.0s)]
*  that's only £34.99 as part of the bundle. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=156.0s)]
*  And the pricing gets a little bit weirder elsewhere. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=160.0s)]
*  Do you remember the £66.99 digital cost of Mario Kart World? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=163.0s)]
*  Well, that's the same physical cost of Donkey Kong Bonanza when that one comes out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=166.0s)]
*  And the digital cost of Donkey Kong is £58.99. Is that all a little bit confusing? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=171.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's an issue for Nintendo and something they're going to really have to get their heads around. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=177.0s)]
*  Besides all of that, when it actually comes to the retailers, they'll pick their price anyway. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=182.0s)]
*  So this is what Nintendo is selling for on their own store. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=186.0s)]
*  But with competition, as you would hope, you'll probably see over time different discounts and different prices, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=190.0s)]
*  and perhaps some more round figures. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=197.0s)]
*  We're also making these judgments based on what we know now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=199.0s)]
*  Only two games we actually know the price of. Maybe third-party games will be a lot less. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=203.0s)]
*  Maybe some will be a lot more. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=207.0s)]
*  And while we're questioning Nintendo's prices right now, let's remember there are a heck of a lot of rumours [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=209.0s)]
*  swirling around what Grand Theft Auto VI will cost when that comes out later this year, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=215.0s)]
*  although let's just put this on Front Street. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=221.0s)]
*  No suggestion that we do not suggest here that we think it's going to switch to. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=224.0s)]
*  Nobody knows. That would be a coup though, wouldn't it? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=229.0s)]
*  How about Metroid Prime 4? Look at this game. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=232.0s)]
*  You can play it with a mouse just swirling your hand. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=236.0s)]
*  You can play it pointing at the screen. The variety is what makes it exciting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=239.0s)]
*  Civilization VII, another game you can play just like with a mouse, though I did think when I had my hands on it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=243.0s)]
*  It's pretty cool I'm playing it, just moving my hand around like a mouse, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=249.0s)]
*  but also why am I not just playing Civ VII on my PC if I'm going to play a game like this? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=252.0s)]
*  Cyberpunk 2077 looks really good on the Switch 2. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=258.0s)]
*  Of course it doesn't look as good as it does on the PlayStation 5, let alone the PlayStation 5 Pro, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=263.0s)]
*  but you wouldn't expect that, obviously. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=268.0s)]
*  The hook here is you can take it with you portably. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=270.0s)]
*  Remember, a lot of people re-bought games they already owned to have them on the Switch [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=273.0s)]
*  so that you could bring them with you on the go as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=279.0s)]
*  So possibly Nintendo is going to hope it gets that bit of the market too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=282.0s)]
*  Drag X Drive, this game, okay, it's like wheelchair basketball, the simulator, but the future, and dystopia. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=285.0s)]
*  You can roll these things like this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=292.0s)]
*  One thing I didn't show you there, which I only found out after I left the booth annoyingly, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=294.0s)]
*  is you can also rub the controllers on your knees. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=298.0s)]
*  But actually, if I'm being really honest, I actually did know that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=301.0s)]
*  It's just that I practiced it and I thought that the visual of me rubbing my thighs with these controllers [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=305.0s)]
*  is too weird for me to put on television or on YouTube. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=312.0s)]
*  Sorry, YouTube, no thigh-rubbing gameplay for me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=316.0s)]
*  But pushing these controllers on the table was a bit of a workout, actually, kind of surprisingly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=320.0s)]
*  I did wonder about the pressure it was putting on my palms, whether that would get a bit too much for me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=324.0s)]
*  And Donkey Kong Bananza. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=328.0s)]
*  This is the game which is like the destruction simulator. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=330.0s)]
*  You're running around bashing literally everything. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=333.0s)]
*  The guy said when I was playing it to me, you know, this game, you can destruct most things. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=335.0s)]
*  In the tutorial level, I did notice there were like these iron girders you couldn't get past, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=342.0s)]
*  I guess basically the barrier at the end of the levels, but everything else you could just destroy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=346.0s)]
*  He just runs up, was destroying everything above him, and then down was destroying below. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=350.0s)]
*  And doesn't it look a bit like Mario Odyssey? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=353.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's built on the same engine, but doesn't it just look a lot like it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=355.0s)]
*  When you die, you lose gold, much like you lose coins in Mario when you die. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=358.0s)]
*  And then also you can beat the people, they have exclamation marks above their head. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=363.0s)]
*  You're getting big bananas rather than big moons, but it all seems... [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=367.0s)]
*  And I know that that currency can be spent in shops, and I did ask the person who told me, thought, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=371.0s)]
*  that that was to get different outfits, though I'm not sure if he was meant to say that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=376.0s)]
*  And thus concluded my time with Nintendo Switch 2 in Paris. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=380.0s)]
*  I thought, what a great thing to have. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=383.0s)]
*  I thought the console felt so good when I was holding it, really felt comfortable, ergonomic, it felt right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=385.0s)]
*  It may look big, but I think it feels about how you would hope it would. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=393.0s)]
*  I'm sure it has the same problem with Switch, with Steam Deck, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=397.0s)]
*  in that after you play it for a little bit of time, your wrists get a bit tired. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=400.0s)]
*  I thought it was great to get my hands on the console and play these games. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=403.0s)]
*  There was no question in my mind, as a big gamer and a big old nerd, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=407.0s)]
*  that Metroid Prime will be a really, really good game, as will Mario Kart World. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=411.0s)]
*  The different modes on show in that game, the knockout tournament, the free riding, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=416.0s)]
*  I thought all of that is definitely going to grab people's attention for a long time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=421.0s)]
*  But the question, as with anything, is the price. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=425.0s)]
*  Will it be another 3DS situation, where after a few months Nintendo decides, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=428.0s)]
*  maybe these sales aren't quite what we want, so we'll drop the price? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=432.0s)]
*  Or is it actually just the fact that 150 million people bought a Switch? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=435.0s)]
*  They're definitely going to get enough people buying a Switch, too. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=441.0s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know which one it's going to be, but we'll find out when June rolls around. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=445.0s)]
*  Thanks for watching! [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuZ874eQJHs&t=465.0s)]
