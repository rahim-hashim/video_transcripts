Video Description: Vehicles were set alight outside several French prisons, and one jail was hit by gunfire from an automatic weapon, in a wave of overnight attacks.
 
Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said the jails had faced "intimidation attempts" and linked the attacks to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking.
 
Seven prisons were targeted in Toulon, Aix-En-Provence, Marseille, Valence and Nîmes in southern France, and in Villepinte and Nanterre, near Paris, according to the Parisien newspaper.
 
France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said it was investigating.

# French prisons hit by wave of overnight attacks | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE)
*  A number of prisons in France have been targeted overnight, the Justice Minister says, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=0.0s)]
*  incidents outside prisons in Marseille and Toulon. It's reportedly being seen as a response [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=5.84s)]
*  to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. Cars have been set alight in prison car parks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=11.32s)]
*  while gunfire was heard in Toulon. Earlier I spoke to our reporter Chris Brockman, who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=16.12s)]
*  told us the latest on the situation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=22.0s)]
*  What you need to know is that the Justice Minister is going down to the prisons to see [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=25.48s)]
*  himself what happened. They're taking this very seriously for one particular reason. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=29.2s)]
*  Last year a drug baron was being transported between his jail and the courthouse to see [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=33.36s)]
*  a judge and he was freed by a gang. They used machine guns at a point of the motorway where [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=39.08s)]
*  you pay at Toulbouth and they killed two prison officers and injured three others using machine [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  guns. They took away the drug baron and they only captured him earlier this year down in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=50.72s)]
*  Romania. So in fact this is something which is very seriously. On top of that there was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=55.84s)]
*  a parliamentary report recently which said that drug gangs had managed to infiltrate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=60.0s)]
*  the recruitment process of prison officers and so they naturally had drug members who [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=65.16s)]
*  were prison officers themselves. And right now as I'm talking they're actually creating [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  a special prison for the 200 most dangerous prisoners in France or inmates in the Normandy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=74.84s)]
*  which will be open sometime at the end of the summer so that precisely these most dangerous [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=81.66s)]
*  prisoners are really kept under real lock and barrel and they can't speak to people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=86.22s)]
*  in the outside world or at least everything they're doing is better monitored. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  These attacks overnight are a pretty bold move, a challenge to the government's authority [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=94.98s)]
*  it would seem. What more beyond that prison that you were just describing is the government [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=99.38s)]
*  proposing to do? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=104.64s)]
*  I think there's a widespread consensus that the drug issue in France is the biggest consumer [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=106.84s)]
*  of illegal drugs in Europe and they're really washing ashore and where the prisons are, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=112.28s)]
*  Toulon, Marseille are huge port cities as well and drugs are washing ashore there through [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=117.28s)]
*  the ports. They're coming up from Spain, from North Africa. Basically they have a big drug [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  problem here and the first thing is they've got to try and tackle that better. The problem [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=127.16s)]
*  is that people who actually, the real drug barons who run all these groups, most of them [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  are based abroad in North Africa, in the Middle East, even Thailand, places like that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=135.4s)]
*  Getting hold of them is very, very difficult. What they're doing is they're tackling from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=143.24s)]
*  the bottom down the small dealers but not the big barons who are abroad and it's really [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=147.08s)]
*  trying to get them. There's a lot of efforts I know by, there's a special task force of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=152.88s)]
*  judges now who are trying to get all these people extradited from these countries, mainly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=157.24s)]
*  in North Africa, Dubai and Thailand I said, and bring them to justice over in France. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=162.16s)]
*  But until that happens, it's a big issue. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IuLikTeYDE&t=166.48s)]
