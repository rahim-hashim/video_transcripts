# Counter-terrorism police leading Heathrow fire investigation | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4)
*  We start with that breaking news from here in London. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=0.0s)]
*  Counter-terrorism police leading the investigation [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=3.04s)]
*  after Europe's busiest airport Heathrow [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=6.8s)]
*  was completely closed until midnight at least. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=9.48s)]
*  It follows what has been described as a catastrophic fire [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=13.16s)]
*  at a nearby electrical substation, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  which then caused a major power cut. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=18.56s)]
*  The Metropolitan Police says it is investigating, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=21.44s)]
*  and it says, given the location of the substation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=23.84s)]
*  and the impact of this incident, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=27.16s)]
*  counter-terror officers will be leading the inquiries. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=29.24s)]
*  The Met says while there is currently no indication [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=33.16s)]
*  of foul play, it remains and retains an open mind. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=35.92s)]
*  Well, inbound passengers are currently being diverted [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=42.28s)]
*  to other airports in the United Kingdom [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=45.16s)]
*  and indeed around the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=47.72s)]
*  Some planes had to turn around midair [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=49.16s)]
*  and then return to where they had originally taken off from. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=51.84s)]
*  Around 150 people have been evacuated from their homes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  because of the fire, and nearly 5,000 are still [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=59.0s)]
*  without any electricity. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=62.0s)]
*  The London Fire Brigade has said the blaze is under control, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=63.6s)]
*  although 10% of the substation is still burning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=67.04s)]
*  And these pictures are of inside Heathrow Airport [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=71.32s)]
*  when the power cut happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=74.76s)]
*  Corridors were plunged into darkness [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=76.12s)]
*  with just emergency lights still on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=78.68s)]
*  Well, passengers are now being advised [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  not to travel to the airport. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=84.08s)]
*  Airlines are warning the disruption could last [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=85.56s)]
*  for several days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=88.28s)]
*  Today's total closure of London Heathrow Airport [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=90.96s)]
*  affects more than 1,300 flights globally, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=94.0s)]
*  that's according to FlightRadar24. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=97.96s)]
*  And at the time of the announcement, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=100.08s)]
*  they say there were 120 aircraft in the air [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=101.64s)]
*  that have had to divert to alternative airports [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=105.6s)]
*  or to return to their original airports [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  where they had flown from. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=111.96s)]
*  Heathrow is the UK's biggest airport [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=112.8s)]
*  with more than 83.9 million passengers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=115.56s)]
*  traveling through its terminals last year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Questions are now being asked about why Heathrow, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  such a key and pivotal part of the national UK infrastructure [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=124.44s)]
*  did not have an adequate backup power supply [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=128.84s)]
*  that would have allowed it to stay open today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=132.68s)]
*  Let's get the very latest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=136.04s)]
*  We can go to Rich Preston, our correspondent [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  who's at the airport. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=141.68s)]
*  Rich, just bring us up to date with what you are hearing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=142.92s)]
*  on the latest developments. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=145.72s)]
*  Well, Ben, what we're hearing now is that the airport [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  is still closed and will be remaining closed until midnight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  That line has not changed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=155.56s)]
*  There are no airplanes in the sky, as you can see behind me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Anyone that has ever been around Heathrow, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  you see planes taking off and landing every few seconds. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=164.2s)]
*  That just isn't happening today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  I was in a hotel just up the road a little earlier. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  And the lobby of the hotel is just full of people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=172.4s)]
*  surrounded by their suitcases. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  They've checked out already. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=177.84s)]
*  They've got nowhere to go because these flights [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=179.8s)]
*  just are not taking off and are not arriving either. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=182.52s)]
*  The ripples of this, of course, being felt far and wide. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=186.4s)]
*  Yes, this is a London airport, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=189.16s)]
*  but it's the airport with the most international connections [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=191.04s)]
*  in the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=194.44s)]
*  Think if you live in the United States, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=195.28s)]
*  you're traveling to Asia, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=196.24s)]
*  chances are you might be going via Heathrow. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=197.56s)]
*  If you're traveling in Europe and you're going to America, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=200.48s)]
*  you might be going via Heathrow. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  So this is affecting people around the UK [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=204.68s)]
*  and all over the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=207.52s)]
*  And as we heard earlier on as well, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=208.84s)]
*  the fire still burning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  LFB confirmed that earlier, 10% still burning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=211.96s)]
*  So it doesn't look like the power's going to be coming on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=216.6s)]
*  here anytime soon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=219.16s)]
*  There are 5,000 other properties in the area [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=220.52s)]
*  which are affected. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=223.52s)]
*  The roads around Heathrow are closed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=224.6s)]
*  Police not letting people off the off ramps [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=227.36s)]
*  from the nearby roads down towards the airport [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=230.2s)]
*  do not travel here is the loud and clear message. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's the message, loud and clear. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And we were hearing from one travel expert [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  who was saying the knock-on effects of this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=240.72s)]
*  could last for maybe four, five, six days. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=243.28s)]
*  I mean, this won't be over in 24 hours. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=250.72s)]
*  Because, of course, all these people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  that were expecting to come into Heathrow [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=254.0s)]
*  still want to come into Heathrow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=255.72s)]
*  Now, it's already an airport [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=257.24s)]
*  which is pretty much a capacity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  It's talking about adding a new runway [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=260.36s)]
*  to deal with the additional numbers required. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  So to get all these people through the system, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  this is going to take a bit of time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=267.6s)]
*  And of course, we're talking about passengers, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=269.16s)]
*  but Heathrow is also a major cargo hub. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=271.36s)]
*  So if you're ordering things online [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=275.04s)]
*  or if you work in the logistics industry [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=276.88s)]
*  and you deal with things coming in at the next day, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  that's going to be affected as well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=281.92s)]
*  So this is going to have an impact, yes, on people, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  yes on their holidays and their valuable time off [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  going to see family, friends, relatives, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  going for job interviews, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=292.44s)]
*  but it's also going to have a big impact [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=293.72s)]
*  on the UK economy as well with, as I say, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=296.04s)]
*  those ripples farther afield. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=298.48s)]
*  And given that and its importance [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  to UK national infrastructure, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=302.36s)]
*  there are a lot of questions, as I mentioned earlier, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=303.76s)]
*  about why the backup systems, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  the alternative power supplies weren't good enough, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=308.76s)]
*  weren't efficient enough [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=311.8s)]
*  to keep the airport up and running today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=313.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be some big important questions [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  being asked about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=320.12s)]
*  This is a key transport hub, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=321.04s)]
*  a key part of what is referred to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  as critical national infrastructure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=325.36s)]
*  It forms part of the government's national security strategy [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=327.92s)]
*  and how they deal with emergencies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=332.04s)]
*  So there will be really big questions [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=333.44s)]
*  and some answers expected as to why one fire [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=335.56s)]
*  at one power plant knocked out this entire massive, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  vitally important airport, which you see empty behind me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=344.16s)]
*  OK, for the moment, Rich, thanks very much indeed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=349.0s)]
*  More from you later on. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=351.76s)]
*  But in the meantime, let's just hear the latest update [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=353.08s)]
*  about the fire itself from the Deputy Commissioner [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=355.88s)]
*  of the London Fire Brigade speaking a few minutes ago. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=359.0s)]
*  At 20.23 on the evening of the 20th of March, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=362.36s)]
*  London Fire Brigade received 212 calls [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=366.68s)]
*  to a fire in a high-voltage substation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=370.12s)]
*  near Heathrow Airport. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  The fire involved a transformer comprising of 25,000 litres [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=375.0s)]
*  of cooling oil, fully alight. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=379.04s)]
*  This created a major hazard due to the still-live [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  high-voltage equipment and the nature of the oil-fuelled fire. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=385.68s)]
*  LFB was in close contact with Blue Light Partners overnight [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=390.88s)]
*  and at 0042, the Metropolitan Police declared a major incident. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  This remains a very visible and significant incident. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=399.84s)]
*  Our firefighters worked tirelessly in challenging [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=403.96s)]
*  and very hazardous conditions to bring the fire under control [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=407.76s)]
*  as swiftly as possible. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=411.52s)]
*  As of the most recent update that I have received, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=414.36s)]
*  approximately 10% remains alight, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=417.56s)]
*  and we are working with SSE to safely resolve this incident. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=421.04s)]
*  As a result of the incident, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  67,000 households were left without power. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=427.48s)]
*  Currently, 5,000 homes remain without power. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  There remains no power at Heathrow Airport Terminal 2 [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=435.2s)]
*  or Terminal 4. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=438.84s)]
*  The incident caused London Heathrow to close the airport [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  and planes to be rerouted. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=444.32s)]
*  We continue to work very closely with our partners [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=446.68s)]
*  to minimise disruption. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=450.0s)]
*  So that is the latest from the London Fire Brigade. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=452.64s)]
*  Well, of course, so many passengers really badly affected [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=455.56s)]
*  by the disruption. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's talk to one of them, Lucy Adler, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=460.08s)]
*  who is currently stranded in Delhi. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Lucy, just tell us what happened to you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  What's your story? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  Hi, Ben. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=467.84s)]
*  So I was one of those passengers who was literally mid-flight. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  Our flight took off at sort of 5am local time. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  Most people were asleep, the captain woke everybody up, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  and started to explain what was happening in Heathrow. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=480.16s)]
*  We all expected him to then go on and say, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=482.76000000000005s)]
*  so we're going to take you to another London airport. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=485.68s)]
*  But what he actually said was, we're turning back round [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=489.16s)]
*  and we're going back to Delhi. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=491.68s)]
*  So, yeah, nine hours of flying to end up right back [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  where we started was pretty painful. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  That is painful. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=498.44s)]
*  What are your circumstances now? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=500.8s)]
*  Where are you staying? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you getting any compensation? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  Has anybody laid on a hotel for you? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=506.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm travelling on my own, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=508.6s)]
*  so I was pretty anxious about what was going to happen. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=511.0s)]
*  Luckily, the airline kind of got us to a hotel, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=514.32s)]
*  but then it's sort of been radio silence since then. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=517.96s)]
*  So no one knows what's happening with the flight. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=520.72s)]
*  They just told us to check the app, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=523.24s)]
*  but the app's just saying that we've already landed. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=524.84s)]
*  So, yeah, there's a lot of sort of anxiety, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=528.0s)]
*  lots of people trying to sort their own thing out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=531.72s)]
*  We were given a letter, which meant that we were going to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=533.96s)]
*  We were given a letter which basically said, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=536.96s)]
*  if you can sort yourself out, you're entitled to claim back [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=539.44s)]
*  at a later time and this letter is your proof. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=542.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=547.12s)]
*  Are there any alternative flights you could get? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=547.96s)]
*  Are you looking at other ways of getting home? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=549.64s)]
*  I mean, obviously, as soon as the announcement was made, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=552.6s)]
*  everyone was trying to get onto the Wi-Fi on the plane. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=555.64s)]
*  I feel really lucky that I have managed to get [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  an alternative flight out at 1am via Zurich [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  to land in Birmingham Airport. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=568.24s)]
*  So not ideal, but the more I've seen the reporting [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=570.24s)]
*  and what's happening in Heathrow, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=574.04s)]
*  I don't think there's much confidence [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=575.12s)]
*  that planes are going to be landing there anytime soon. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=576.64s)]
*  So I'm very happy to have got that flight. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=582.28s)]
*  So had you been in Delhi, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=583.12s)]
*  were you there on business or on holiday? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=584.36s)]
*  No, so I was here for work. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=587.28s)]
*  So yeah, really nice trip [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  and looking forward to getting home today [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=591.48s)]
*  in time for the school run, back to mum duties. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=593.44s)]
*  But yeah, not to be. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=596.96s)]
*  And actually just the worst possible day [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=598.96s)]
*  to be potentially flying because I mean, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  this hasn't happened at Heathrow Airport ever, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  nothing like this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  There was a shutdown back in 2010 [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=607.12s)]
*  because of that Icelandic volcano. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=610.12s)]
*  But apart from that, there's never been a total shutdown. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  So you're very unlucky. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=614.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=617.2s)]
*  And I think everybody was sort of grumbling at first [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  and then the more we were reading what was happening, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=620.6s)]
*  you kind of realised actually, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=623.36s)]
*  this is a pretty significant thing that's happened. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=624.52s)]
*  And as you say, very unlucky. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=627.76s)]
*  All right, well Lucy, good luck to you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  And I hope you do get home safely before too long. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=631.88s)]
*  And well done for making other arrangements. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=635.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=638.4s)]
*  So that is Lucy Adler, currently stranded in Delhi, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=640.92s)]
*  but hoping to get home via Zurich to Birmingham. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=643.48s)]
*  Let's go to Lorna Gordon, our correspondent in Glasgow. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=647.16s)]
*  And are flights landing there, Lorna, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=651.44s)]
*  that were supposed to be landing in Heathrow? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's been five flights landing here at Glasgow [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=658.96s)]
*  that were originally destined for Heathrow, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  all trans-Atlantics, three of them British Airways, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=665.8000000000001s)]
*  two Virgin Atlantics, and very tired people disembarking [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=669.04s)]
*  at the last couple of hours. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=673.64s)]
*  They were telling us they were only told [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=676.44s)]
*  that their flights were being diverted [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=679.4000000000001s)]
*  about an hour before landing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=681.24s)]
*  Those who had some kind of internet connection [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=683.72s)]
*  were trying to make alternative plans. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=686.24s)]
*  One couple told me that they had to get home [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=688.6s)]
*  to the southeast because the gentleman [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  was involved in a wedding tomorrow. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=696.2800000000001s)]
*  He was the master of ceremony, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  so they'd managed to spend Â£922 [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=701.2s)]
*  on two flights back down to Gatwick. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=704.7600000000001s)]
*  They say they think they got the last seats on that flight, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=708.08s)]
*  but for quite a hefty price. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  Others we were speaking to, there was a party of 12 [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=714.88s)]
*  who were heading from the States up to Helsinki [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=717.24s)]
*  and then onwards to the Arctic Circle [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=720.48s)]
*  for a very special holiday. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=722.2s)]
*  They, of course, were less familiar with UK geography, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  trying to work out how they would make their way there. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=727.6s)]
*  They were told to get flights out of Manchester, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=729.76s)]
*  and they were trying to work out how to do that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  and how to get down to Manchester. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=735.48s)]
*  We've heard from them in the last few minutes [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=737.44s)]
*  they've managed to book on to a bus to take them down there [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=739.12s)]
*  and then onwards for that journey. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  People were sort of accepting of the situation, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=744.84s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, but slightly frustrated [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGVp_kIjq4&t=748.08s)]
