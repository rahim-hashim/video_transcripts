Video Description: Authorities in Turkey have arrested dozens of people for "provocative" social media posts after the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu was detained on Wednesday.
 
Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people held on charges including corruption and aiding terrorist groups - a move that has sparked protests in Istanbul and the capital Ankara.
 
A member of the secular Republican People's Party, Imamoglu is a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and was set to be named a presidential candidate for the 2028 elections later this week.
 
Critics say his arrest is a "coup" and are planning further demonstrations, despite Istanbul's pro-Erdogan governor banning protests for four days.

# Turkey arrests dozens over online posts after Erdogan presidential rival detained | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc)
*  Demonstrations are planned at universities across Istanbul today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=0.0s)]
*  amid calls for wider process over the arrest and detention of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=3.52s)]
*  President Erdogan's top rival, the Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=6.84s)]
*  On Wednesday, students and protesters clashed with riot police in the capital Ankara. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=11.4s)]
*  As police deployed tear gas and water cannon on crowds in the capital, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=16.2s)]
*  protesters also gathered in cities across Turkey. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=20.52s)]
*  Despite a government ban which extends online, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=23.44s)]
*  police say they detained 37 suspects for allegedly making what they called [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=26.88s)]
*  provocative social media posts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=31.12s)]
*  Mr. Imamoglu was set to be named as the presidential candidate for the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=34.08s)]
*  opposition Republican People's Party, known as the CHP. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=37.68s)]
*  The government say they are cracking down on corruption and accuse the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=42.0s)]
*  opposition of links to a terrorist group. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=45.64s)]
*  The opposition say this is about Erdogan consolidating his power. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=48.08s)]
*  Our reporter Emily Withers brought us up to date. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  So I think what's interesting is that Imamoglu may have spent the night in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=55.68s)]
*  custody, but it's the opposition party that still controls the municipality [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=60.36s)]
*  here in Istanbul. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=64.84s)]
*  So when people woke up this morning and commuted into work using the metro, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=66.12s)]
*  they heard the voice of Imamoglu blaring out on speakers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=70.68s)]
*  There are already calls today for more large demonstrations to happen at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=74.76s)]
*  universities across the city. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=79.36s)]
*  There are calls for more wider protests, particularly here in Istanbul [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  and in Ankara. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=85.63999999999999s)]
*  As you said there, there were large crowds, tens of thousands out on the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=86.8s)]
*  streets in Istanbul and Ankara last night who clashed with police. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  But the numbers still aren't quite large enough to really put major [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  political pressure on the president, President Erdogan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  We may see the protests grow as we move into the weekend, but Turks know [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=102.96s)]
*  that it's very risky to protest here in Turkey. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  There are many detentions that happen here and they may not want to take [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  that risk. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=114.16s)]
*  We're also seeing arrests related to online media. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  So the Turkish authorities have said that they detained 37 suspects already [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=118.6s)]
*  for allegedly making what they called provocative social media posts over [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=123.96s)]
*  the detention of Imamoglu. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  We also expect that there will be more arrests of opposition figures in the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=131.24s)]
*  coming days. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, when it comes to Imamoglu, we know that the authorities here have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=137.0s)]
*  now seized his construction company that he co-owns. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=140.44s)]
*  And it may be that in the coming days, he is replaced with a government [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=144.4s)]
*  appointee pending his investigation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  Tell us a bit more about Ekrem Imamoglu and why the concern around him from [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=152.4s)]
*  President Erdogan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=157.88s)]
*  Ekrem Imamoglu is incredibly popular. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=161.96s)]
*  He's very charismatic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  He appeals to people across the political divide. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  And on Sunday, there was supposed to be a major opposition voting round [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  where they were going to name Ekrem Imamoglu as their presidential [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=176.84s)]
*  candidate in future elections. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=180.52s)]
*  The opposition say that that's still going ahead despite what happens to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=182.8s)]
*  Ekrem Imamoglu. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, this is part of a months long crackdown that we've seen here in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=189.24s)]
*  Turkey where many opposition mayors, business leaders and journalists have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=194.56s)]
*  been rounded up in a nationwide crackdown. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=199.12s)]
*  And, you know, Imamoglu wouldn't be the first political leader to be put in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  jail. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=207.96s)]
*  Just earlier this month, the leader of a Turkish opposition party was arrested [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  and detained. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  He's currently in jail right now pending a trial on charges of insulting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=215.0s)]
*  President Erdogan and inciting hatred. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  He, too, has called the charges political. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=222.88s)]
*  And this is all part of Erdogan trying to shore up power potentially ahead of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=225.72s)]
*  early elections. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEBXrt60nc&t=230.48000000000002s)]
