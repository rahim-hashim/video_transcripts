Video Description: The Trump administration believes Ukraine is "ready to move forward" with a ceasefire process, according to a senior US state department official.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is in Saudi Arabia for a state visit, ahead of talks between US and Ukrainian officials on Tuesday.
 
Officials from Ukraine and the US will meet for the first time since the clash between their two leaders last week.

Zelensky is under pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, amid an ongoing pause in US military aid and intelligence sharing.

*  Ahead of the talks and speaking on Fox News, President Trump described the war as a mess. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=117.66s)]
*  Are you comfortable with that? The fact that you walked away and Ukraine may not survive? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, it may not survive anyway, but you know, we have some weaknesses with Russia. You know, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  it takes two. Look, it was not going to happen, that war, and it happened. So now we're stuck [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=136.54s)]
*  with this mess. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=142.7s)]
*  But just a few hours ago, he suggested the US is easing its paws on sharing military [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=144.66s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=150.06s)]
*  We want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  You have the bill. We gave you three hours. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  The relationship between America and Ukraine remains fragile after a heated exchange in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=160.66000000000003s)]

*  And Europe has also come under fire from President Trump, who wants it to step up and spend more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=170.78s)]
*  on defense. The UK has already committed to increasing its spending on defense and said [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  it's willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine. But what's not clear is how many [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=183.34s)]
*  other European countries could join a so-called coalition of the willing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=188.42s)]
*  The US knows Ukraine is coming to these latest talks on the back foot, and if progress towards [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=194.92s)]
*  peace is to be made, then compromise will also be needed. Thomas McGill, BBC News. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=201.62s)]
*  We can get more analysis on those talks. We can speak to senior fellow in the War Studies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=209.1s)]
*  Department at King's College London, Nawaf Obed. Thank you for joining us on BBC News. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  So give us a sense of Saudi Arabia's position in all of this, because it's been able to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=220.5s)]
*  maintain close ties with Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. How has it managed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=225.02s)]
*  that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=230.66s)]
*  Well, because it's really positioned itself over the last decade to nurture and to be [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=232.14s)]
*  able to position itself as, if you want, a global interlocutor. It's had a superb relationship [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=238.33999999999997s)]
*  with the Trump administration, the first one. It has been able to co-manage the global energy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  markets for the last decade or so through the OPEC plus mechanism with the Russian president, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=252.26s)]
*  and as well as it's been able to be the centre and the source of numerous prisoner releases [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=259.46s)]
*  between the Ukrainians and the Russians. So in a way, if you look deeper into it, you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=267.26s)]
*  see Saudi Arabia is one of the very few countries that has a global consequence that is consequential [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=271.7s)]
*  enough to be able to be doing what it's doing today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=277.18s)]
*  And during this war, it's provided Ukraine with millions of dollars, hundreds of millions [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=280.94s)]
*  of dollars in humanitarian aid. At the same time, it's continued an economic partnership [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=285.38s)]
*  with Russia. How would you compare the two? And will Saudi Arabia still be considered [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=291.74s)]
*  neutral in this conflict? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=295.98s)]
*  Well, the economic partnership with Russia, it's been more of an energy management of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=297.94s)]
*  the global energy markets. So as I was earlier saying, through the OPEC plus mechanism, the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=302.94s)]
*  two largest oil exporters, be it Saudi Arabia and Russia, were able to manage it and to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=310.38s)]
*  make sure that there was no disruption in economic, global disruption due to the war [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=317.5s)]
*  between the Russians and Ukrainians. And on the other side, as you correctly pointed out, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=323.26s)]
*  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been key in providing a lot of humanitarian aid [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=328.58s)]
*  to the Ukrainians. So it's not one versus the other. They're relatively neutral, and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=333.42s)]
*  at the same time, in the person of the Crown Prince, he's been able to have an enormous [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  amount of credibility, trust, and above all, influence to be able to bring all the warring [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=346.86s)]
*  parties to Saudi Arabia to hopefully end this war. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=352.66s)]
*  Nawaf Obaid from King's College, London. Thank you for sharing your analysis with us here [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgWglbqE8U&t=357.14000000000004s)]
