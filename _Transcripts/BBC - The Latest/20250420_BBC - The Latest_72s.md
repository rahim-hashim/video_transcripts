**BBC - The Latest:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ)
*  There is a scepticism in Ukraine about this last-minute truce announced by Russia over this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Easter weekend, this 48-hour ceasefire. Vladimir Putin has done this before. He did it in early [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  2023 over the Christmas holidays. We reported from the frontline city of Bakhmut, which fell [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=11.84s)]
*  shortly after that. There was no letting up in the fighting as invading forces continued to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=18.88s)]
*  advance. But what this does do, with the language of Moscow saying we will announce this ceasefire [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=24.16s)]

*  deal. That puts Ukraine in a difficult situation because the White House has been relatively [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=34.56s)]
*  Moscow-friendly. And if President Zelensky was to give an order that could be portrayed as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  escalating tensions along the front lines, then that could have dire consequences for Ukraine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=46.0s)]

*  showed us a screen grab of an order he has received to stop firing at the Russians and to record [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=57.04s)]
*  every instance when they fire the other way. The government here is saying that Russia is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=63.68s)]
*  firing artillery as normal right across the front line. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ilCz_6IxFQ&t=68.32s)]
