**BBC - The Latest:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk)
*  We start with breaking news. Police in the Canadian city of Vancouver say a number of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=0.0s)]
*  people have been killed and multiple others injured after a vehicle was driven into a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  crowd at a street festival. The driver has been arrested. The city's mayor, Ken Sim, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=10.36s)]
*  has said he is shocked and deeply saddened by what he called an horrific incident. And [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=16.36s)]
*  the pictures that we're now looking at are from the scene there in Vancouver and of course [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=22.92s)]
*  police as we mentioned they're saying that several people have been killed and many others [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=29.28s)]
*  are injured. We're expecting more developments from the police. They say of course that they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=35.32s)]
*  continue to carry out their investigations. We also had a statement coming in from Canada's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=40.32s)]
*  Prime Minister, Mark Carney, and I'll just read that out to you. It was posted on X. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  He said, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=53.56s)]
*  and just as we look at those images once again from the scene there was an interesting statement [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=83.72s)]
*  that came in from Jagmeet Singh. He is the leader of the New Democratic Party, an opposition party [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=91.08s)]
*  in Canada. Now he was at the Lapu Lapu Day event in Vancouver but before the incident took place [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=99.88s)]
*  he said he is horrified to learn that innocent people have been killed and injured. And of course [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=108.36s)]
*  all of this coming just before Canada's federal elections. Of course we do not know of any link [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=115.56s)]
*  between the two events from this crash but as we've been hearing these are some of the images that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  we are able to show you because others being shared on social media are just simply too horrific [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=127.96s)]
*  following that car attack. That vehicle believed to be a black SUV that rammed into a crowd of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=136.04s)]
*  people there that had gathered for this celebration of Filipino culture in Vancouver. Of course the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=144.76s)]
*  Lapu Lapu Day festival is one of the biggest events for Filipinos celebrated both back in the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  Philippines but also across the world as we saw there with the diaspora in Canada. Well we can now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=161.48s)]
*  bring in our correspondent Simon Jones who's following this story for us. Simon what more [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=168.6s)]
*  do we know about this incident? Well this happened at around eight o'clock in the evening local time [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  so around four hours ago and the streets were extremely busy. Thousands of people were [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  celebrating something called Lapu Lapu Day which marks Filipino culture. Now one I witnessed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=185.48s)]
*  he saw a black car driving erratically in the area before that vehicle then ploughed into crowds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=191.56s)]
*  Now some pictures have emerged of the aftermath of the scene but many are too graphic for us [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  to broadcast. On social media there are images of bodies strewn across the road. You see the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=204.12s)]
*  emergency services treating some of the casualties. People are running around in shock and screaming [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  and we also see the front of that black vehicle which is all crumpled in. Now the police say the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=216.36s)]
*  driver of the vehicle has been arrested. Now in terms of reaction we've heard from the Canadian [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=222.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Mark Carney. I'm going to read you what he said on Twitter on X. He said I'm devastated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=227.4s)]
*  to hear about the horrific events of the Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver earlier this evening. He goes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=232.44s)]
*  on to say I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=238.2s)]

*  action and we've heard lots of reaction across the political devise condemning what has happened. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  The local mayor has described the scenes as horrific. Now in terms of the number of people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  who have been killed and the number of people who have been injured the police have yet to give us [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=264.92s)]
*  an update on that but we are expecting a news conference to take place in Vancouver in the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=270.12s)]
*  coming minutes. Yes in the coming minutes and Simon as you're with us and this just arriving [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  into us in the newsroom this is an updated statement from the police saying that at [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=282.2s)]
*  approximately as you mentioned 8 14 p.m on April the 26th a man drove into a large crowd of people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=290.52s)]
*  attending the Lapu Lapu day festival near East 43rd Avenue and Frazier Street. Crucially they say [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=296.52s)]
*  a 30 year old suspect a Vancouver man was arrested at the scene. Police saying that the investigation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=303.24s)]
*  is ongoing and is being led by the Vancouver Police Department's major crime section. So a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  bit of detail there about the suspect in this attack there Simon. Yeah I think the new bit of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=317.56s)]
*  information we got in that statement from the police in Vancouver is a suspect is a 30 year old [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=322.84s)]
*  and also comes from the area. Now the police will be keen to question him as soon as possible we [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=328.44s)]
*  don't know whether he was injured in what appears to be this attack but the police will be looking [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  for any sort of motivation behind what has happened but certainly a terrifying experience [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=340.12s)]
*  for the people who were out on the streets and what we don't know at the moment is just how bad [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=345.88s)]
*  it is in terms of the number of people who died and the number of people who have been injured but [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=351.08s)]
*  when the police are talking about multiple casualties here it's clear that this has been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=355.8s)]
*  a major incident and those numbers are likely to be high. And Simon as we mentioned some of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=360.76s)]
*  images on social media just too horrific to show on television but just give us a sense of what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=367.24s)]
*  has happened there and what it looks like in Vancouver today. Well this was the second annual [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=375.0s)]
*  Lapu Lapu festival so people out on the streets celebrating enjoying themselves there was music [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  there were stalls there was due to be a parade so an event for the community to come together to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=388.36s)]
*  share this experience and then a car has ploughed into people and leaving some devastating scenes [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=394.36s)]
*  with bodies on the streets there with the car crumpled up with people in shock running around [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=401.88s)]
*  not knowing not really comprehending what has happened so some awful scenes there and in terms [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=408.2s)]
*  of the police investigation they will want to try and find out as quickly as possible what was behind [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=413.64s)]
*  this whether there was any sort of motive behind it and why this indeed has happened. And what's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=419.4s)]
*  the reaction from eyewitnesses but also on social media people reacting to this horrific attack? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=424.84s)]
*  We've heard from one eyewitness who said that he did see a vehicle in the area that was behaving [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=432.12s)]
*  strangely a driver driving erratically in the words of the witness before ploughing into crowds [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=437.88s)]
*  and then we heard another witness talking about the aftermath of it who said that he looked up [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=443.4s)]
*  the street and he could see body after body. I'm just going to bring you a bit more of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=448.52s)]
*  political reaction the Vancouver mayor Ken Sim has said I'm shocked and deeply saddened by the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=452.92s)]
*  horrific incident at today's Lapu Lapu Day event we will work to provide more information as soon [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=458.68s)]
*  as we can but at this time the police have confirmed there are a number of fatalities [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJLnv_Ccfpk&t=463.56s)]
