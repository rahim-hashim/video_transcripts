Video Description: US President Donald Trump has posted on social media, saying: "We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.”
 
In a separate post, US Vice-President JD Vance said Trump "may decide he needs to take further action" to end Iran's nuclear programme.
 
The US has long provided Israel with military aid and equipment - but its official position since strikes began on Friday has been that the US is not involved in Israeli strikes on Iran.

# 'We have control of Iranian skies’, US President Donald Trump says
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs)
*  Straight to breaking news, the very latest on that Middle East crisis between Iran and Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has just posted on social media, there it is on your screen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=5.76s)]
*  We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=10.24s)]
*  Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of it, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=14.72s)]
*  but it doesn't compare to American-made, conceived and manufactured stuff. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=19.2s)]
*  Nobody does it better than good old USA, he concludes in that post. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=24.32s)]
*  Let's speak to our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  He's there at the G7 gathering and also our North America correspondent, Nomi Iqbal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=32.24s)]
*  She's there live for us at the White House. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=37.28s)]
*  So Nomi, let me start with you and that post. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=39.68s)]
*  And it is the first word of that post that is getting a lot of attention. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=42.96s)]
*  He says, we now have complete and total control of the skies. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=46.96s)]
*  It underlines how intertwined the US and Israel are on this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=50.64s)]
*  It does, but it doesn't give any more clarity on what President Trump plans to do next. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=55.68s)]
*  What he's doing there is flexing US might, but does this now mean that the US is going to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=61.28s)]
*  get all out, involved with Israel and strike, or is it a scare tactic to try and get Iran [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=68.48s)]
*  around the negotiating table? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=76.64s)]
*  We don't even know if that is still something that they are planning for. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=78.4s)]
*  We know that there were meant to be the six round of talks between Iran and the US when [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  it comes to nuclear on Sunday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  That's now been stopped. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=90.64s)]
*  But there are some suggestions that President Trump would still want Steve [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=92.0s)]
*  Wyckoff, his Middle East envoy and the Vice President, JD Vance, to be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  involved in those talks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  And speaking of the Vice President, JD Vance, he's put out some very [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=101.2s)]
*  long post on X in which he has outlined the concerns that the Trump [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=105.12s)]
*  administration has, but he's also referred to, if I can just pick out the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=110.64s)]
*  bit that he said, he says, of course people are right to be worried about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  That's obviously speaking or appealing to the base, the base that voted for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump and millions of others. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=129.6s)]
*  What does this mean going forward? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think we're any clearer on what the US plans to do next when it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  comes to what's happening in Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=139.36s)]
*  Let's cross to the G7 and to James and of course Donald Trump left that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=141.84s)]
*  gathering early in terms of all of those other issues that the gathering [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  wanted to discuss, whether it was tariffs and trade, whether it was [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=152.72s)]
*  the Middle East directly with Donald Trump or President Zelensky on Ukraine. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Give me a sense of the mood where you are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=161.84s)]
*  Well, this is like a birthday party where the birthday party boy has gone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=172.8s)]
*  Donald Trump turned 79 at the weekend and there are a lot of leaders here [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=173.36s)]
*  all dressed up, nowhere to go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=177.44s)]
*  So, I think we're going to have to see what happens next. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=179.44s)]
*  There are a lot of leaders here all dressed up, nowhere to go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=183.12s)]
*  If you think about it, on the second day of a summit like this, you get [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=187.2s)]
*  all the guests, the non-G7 leaders who have come, the leaders of India, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Brazil, South Korea and elsewhere, who have all come here to have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=194.0s)]
*  conversations not just with each other and other world leaders but with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=198.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=202.0s)]
*  You mentioned President Zelensky. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=203.2s)]
*  He, of course, is the central one of that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=204.96s)]
*  Because these events matter, these summits, because they are a chance [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=207.44s)]
*  for world leaders to sit down face to face with Donald Trump to actually [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  shape some of his thinking, to actually have a conversation that can get [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  things into his head that doesn't have to go through other advisors and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  mediators. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  And they were all hoping not just to shape some of his thinking on Iran [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=224.96s)]
*  but also his thinking on Ukraine and specifically to try and put more [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  pressure on Russia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=233.12s)]
*  And although the Canadians and the Europeans and others are announcing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=234.8s)]
*  some more sanctions today and there will be conversations with President [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  Zelensky, Donald Trump left last night making absolutely clear that he is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=242.08s)]
*  very sceptical of him putting more sanctions on Russia because he said [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=246.08s)]
*  it damages the United States economy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  So I think there's a sense of deflation here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  I think there's a sense also, as Nomi was saying, continued puzzlement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=255.12s)]
*  and amusement about precisely what the President intends to do over [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=259.6s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=264.24s)]
*  Because the messaging is confused and it is mixed. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=265.04s)]
*  Nomi, let me come back to you because we were talking an hour or so ago [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  about that exchange on Air Force One with a CBS correspondent who put to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=272.88s)]
*  the President that his own National Intelligence Director had said that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=278.0s)]
*  Iran wasn't heading towards creating a nuclear device and he said, I don't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=281.76s)]
*  care what she said, I think they were very close. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=286.56s)]
*  So there was a very, very interesting exchange there and it begs the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=290.48s)]
*  question, who is Donald Trump depending on in terms of his intelligence [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=294.64s)]
*  advice here? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it was an extraordinary comment by President Trump, especially [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=305.12s)]
*  given that Tulsi Gabbard is part of his base, so to speak. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=308.4s)]
*  In his second term, Donald Trump is very much surrounded by those who [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=312.88s)]
*  subscribe to his MAGA, Make America Great Again belief, which does [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=316.24s)]
*  involve no wars, by the way. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  Unlike his first term, where he had more establishment politicians as [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=323.12s)]
*  he would see it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  But he has dismissed what she clearly said earlier in the year, that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  yes, there have been constant suggestions, certainly by the Israeli [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=332.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Iran is imminently about to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=335.68s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon, but none of that has ever come to fruition, none [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=340.24s)]
*  of that has ever been true, leading to a lot of criticism by certainly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=344.24s)]
*  those who don't want any wars in the Middle East or certainly want the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=347.36s)]
*  US to be involved. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=350.88s)]
*  Is this similar to when there were claims of weapons of mass [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  destruction in Iraq with Saddam Hussein, for example? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=354.56s)]
*  And so where he's getting that information from, it could be from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=357.28s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself, but we're not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=362.08s)]
*  quite sure. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=365.68s)]
*  But it does underline that Donald Trump does believe that Iran is a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=366.88s)]
*  problem and he did say that he wanted something bigger than a ceasefire [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=372.64s)]
*  last night. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=377.68s)]
*  We know that he has said that Iran can't have nuclear weapons, but [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=378.64s)]
*  the only way that could happen is if America does get involved, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=382.8s)]
*  physically involved, in what's happening in the Middle East. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, as we were saying an hour ago, if Donald Trump does make [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=391.28s)]
*  that move and there's no indication that he will, that could be hugely [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=394.4s)]
*  legacy-defining for him, given that the people who voted him into [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=398.08s)]
*  office, millions and millions of votes across this country, had done [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=402.08s)]
*  so largely because of his no wars mantra. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=405.2s)]
*  Very interestingly, as you're speaking, the Reuters news agency is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=409.68s)]
*  reporting that the US military is moving fighter jets to the Middle [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=413.68s)]
*  East and extending deployments of warplanes to bolster defences [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=416.96s)]
*  amid this Israeli-Iran conflict. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=421.36s)]
*  That has come from US officials speaking to Reuters. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=423.76s)]
*  So again, we wait to see any of the next moves from the White House. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's go back to the G7 and James. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  And aside from what is going on in the Middle East, let me come back [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=434.64s)]
*  to trade and tariffs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  We were listening there to Sakir Starmer talking about the one [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=440.56s)]
*  deal that has finally got over the line. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=444.08s)]
*  Did anyone else sitting around the table there with Donald Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=446.96s)]
*  yesterday, so many different countries where there are tariffs [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=450.32s)]
*  imposed, did anybody feel they had made progress? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the Japanese leader, the new Prime Minister, has been very [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=456.96s)]
*  keen to make sure that he can make progress on a US-Japan deal on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=461.52s)]
*  tariffs, so there have been conversations taking place about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=466.08s)]
*  that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=469.12s)]
*  The way the debate is shaped here is not about precise numbers, but [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  it's a series of conversations that are taking place. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  The Japanese leader, the new Prime Minister, has been very keen to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  make sure that he can make progress on a US-Japan deal on [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  The way the debate is shaped here is not about precise numbers, but [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=485.44s)]
*  it's essentially about getting arguments across to the American [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  side. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=492.16s)]
*  So you'll have world leaders saying, look, Mr Trump, if you wish [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=492.72s)]
*  us to join you in dealing with the challenges from countries like [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=496.56s)]
*  China, well, that's easier if our economies are flourishing and not [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=500.56s)]
*  if you're damaging them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=505.36s)]
*  In the same way the Europeans get the argument across saying, look, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=506.72s)]
*  we accept that we have to spend more on our own defence, that we've [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=509.92s)]
*  spent many, many years on this, but we cannot do that, we cannot [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=513.44s)]
*  spend more on defence if our economies are being hit by American [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=517.28s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=520.24s)]
*  In other words, that's the nature, the tone of the debate that's had [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  about trade and tariffs here, rather than the minutiae of specific [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=524.16s)]
*  individual tariff rates and what may or may not happen. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=528.32s)]
*  But as I say, that is a conversation that has been cut short [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=530.96s)]
*  because Donald Trump is no longer here. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=534.88s)]
*  So other leaders here who have not yet had the chance to have that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=537.04s)]
*  conversation with him are going to have to find another time for [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  that to take place. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=543.52s)]
*  James Lando there at the G7. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=544.32s)]
*  Thank you and thanks to Nomi Iqbal live for us at the White House. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EetfszJArTs&t=547.2s)]
