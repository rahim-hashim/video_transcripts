Video Description: People smugglers have exploited "fragmented" policing, border force and intelligence agencies to smuggle thousands of illegal migrants into the UK, prime minister Keir Starmer has said.
 
He added that poor organisation meant the UK was "a soft touch" on illegal migration, which smugglers took as an "open invitation".
 
The prime minister made the case for tackling illegal migration like terrorism as he spoke at the first ever Organised Immigration Crime Summit in London - attended by more than 40 countries alongside tech giants like Meta, X and TikTok.
 
The Conservative party said the conference "will make no difference" and only Rwanda-style deportations would stop illegal migration.
 
The government announced a series of agreements with other countries in an effort to tackle the number of illegal migrants entering the UK.

# People smuggling should be treated 'like terrorism', UK PM Starmer says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI)
*  Sir Keir Starmer has told representatives from over 40 countries that people smuggling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=0.0s)]
*  should be treated like terrorism. He was hosting the first organized immigration crime summit here [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=4.64s)]
*  in London. It brought together the US, China and other countries like Vietnam and Iraq, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=10.48s)]
*  where many migrants travel from. Here's our home editor Mark Easton. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=15.68s)]

*  You were involved in coordinating and facilitating the movement of a significant number of migrants [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=28.16s)]
*  across Europe and into the United Kingdom. These are images the government has issued to coincide [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  with a two-day international summit in London to tackle what it calls the global threat of illegal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=39.6s)]
*  migration. Amman Zada was jailed for 17 years in November for smuggling Kurdish migrants across [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=44.96s)]
*  the channel in small boats. But the prime minister has repeatedly stressed that in his view only [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=51.04s)]
*  international cooperation can combat the threat from organized immigration crime. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=57.04s)]
*  Welcoming delegations from more than 40 states at Lancaster House in London this morning, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=62.16s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer said for too long the UK had been a soft touch for illegal migration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=66.96s)]
*  The people we serve want this issue sorted. But the truth is we can only smash these gangs once [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=72.8s)]
*  and for all if we work together. So this event here at Lancaster House is really the physical [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=81.52s)]
*  embodiment of the prime minister's approach to organized immigration crime, international cooperation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=88.16s)]
*  right along the smuggling routes. But while this is a global issue requiring a global response, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=94.64s)]
*  the prime minister is also well aware of the domestic political pressures when you've got [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=100.64s)]
*  small boats still arriving in record numbers. This year's already seen more than 5,000 migrants [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=105.76s)]
*  crossing the channel in small boats and opposition parties are accusing the government of having [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  lost its grip on the problem. I think the prime minister's credibility on this issue is in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  complete tatters. He promised to smash the gangs. He has completely failed to do that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  In a post on social media this morning, the PM said, illegal migration risks our security. I get [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  it. You're angry. So am I. That's why I'm rolling up my sleeves to fix it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=133.2s)]
*  Rolling up his sleeves in Downing Street terms means greater cooperation with the French to stop [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=139.92s)]
*  dinghies in the channel. It was revealed today that smuggling gangs are using their own drones [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  to avoid police. More money for border security, more UK prosecutors to process those arrested [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=149.92s)]
*  and critically more international deals at every stage of the smuggling route from source countries [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=156.32s)]
*  to the beaches of Kent. Mark Easton, BBC News at Lancaster House in London. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=162.08s)]
*  Well, Mark has now joined me here in the studio. Let's talk more about this summit, this gathering, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=167.68s)]
*  in terms of what we're expecting, in terms of actual new policy. Just take me through the sorts [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  of things the governments are talking about. Well, I think the first thing to say is that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=180.0s)]
*  almost every representative there is facing a very similar kind of situation to the prime minister [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=184.96s)]
*  here in the UK. The problems of organised immigration crime, as they now call it, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=190.4s)]
*  are significant right along the supply chain from the source countries through the transit regions [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=196.8s)]
*  and countries and through, of course, to the reception countries like Britain and the coast [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=202.24s)]
*  of Kent. So there is a determination, I think, across the board to look at ways of trying to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=208.72s)]
*  get support. And countries like the UK will be prepared to put money in to support countries in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=213.68s)]
*  poorer areas to try and relieve some of the burdens. I mean, this is an issue that the prime [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  minister is convinced can only be dealt with through international cooperation. We have seen [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  recently deals signed in Iraq and in Albania. I think what we're going to see from this summit [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=232.0s)]
*  is more deals a bit like that. I think there may be some movement, for instance, on a deal [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=240.0s)]
*  with Vietnam, which has been a source country that has been of some concern. And we've seen the prime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=245.68s)]
*  minister tweeting about it, posting, saying, I understand, I'm as angry as you, in terms of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=251.84s)]
*  his conversation with the voters. He was talking there about treating it as same as terrorism, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=257.2s)]
*  people smuggling gangs. That has been the mantra from this new government, smashing the people [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=261.28s)]
*  smuggling gangs. Has that worked? Well, not on the basis of what we've seen so far this year in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=266.56s)]
*  terms of small boats. If that's your measure, then the opposition parties make the perfectly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=271.92s)]
*  reasonable point that since January we've seen a higher number of people crossing the channel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=276.16s)]
*  than in any previous year. So that is not a problem that has been solved. And you're right, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=280.4s)]
*  there are distinct ideas as to what will work to slow and eventually stop these boats. The [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=285.04s)]
*  Conservatives, of course, believed that what you require is a really strong deterrent. And in their [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=291.52s)]
*  case, that was the Rwanda plan. The current government regards that as a gimmick. But there [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=297.04s)]
*  is a question, I think, about the level of deterrent that the current government is employing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=303.2s)]
*  They say that tougher controls on illegal migrants working in the UK, tougher action against the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=307.84s)]
*  people smugglers themselves, right up the supply chain, that will be a deterrent in itself. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=315.76s)]
*  The jury is still out, I think. You talk about the chain and you're absolutely right, and it goes all [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  the way back to Vietnam and all those other places where people come from. I was talking in the last [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=327.12s)]
*  hour to the former Chief Immigration Officer at the UK's Border Force. He made the point that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=331.92s)]
*  the deterrence isn't there and reflected on the Rwanda scheme. You touched on that, but also said [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=337.76s)]
*  that the French should be doing more. In terms of that relationship, the UK-French relationship, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=343.28s)]
*  where are we on that and any changes to how they operate in terms of those boats setting off from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=349.52s)]
*  those beaches? Well, the Prime Minister in his speech at the summit today did reflect a little [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  bit on what he regards as a much improved relationship with the French. He made the point [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=360.88s)]
*  that until recently, the French would not go into the water, so that once a small dinghy had [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  left the shore, they regarded that as something they could no longer intervene with. The Prime [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=373.52s)]
*  Minister believes that he has now moved on to a state where they can discuss and implement activity [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=378.96s)]
*  in the shallows, in the channel, and actually stop these boats coming across. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylfmfc1iYI&t=384.72s)]
