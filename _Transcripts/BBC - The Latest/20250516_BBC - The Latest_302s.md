# Ukraine and Russia agree to prisoner swap after peace talks | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8)
*  Now, direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have been taking place in Istanbul [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=0.0s)]
*  today, the first such meeting between the warring parties in over three years. There [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=5.64s)]
*  were no handshakes and the expectations were low. There was no significant progress today, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=10.48s)]
*  although both sides have agreed on another prisoner swap. But no ceasefire and nothing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=16.8s)]
*  that changes the status quo. Donald Trump, of course, saying yesterday that there'd only [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=21.64s)]
*  when he and Vladimir Putin actually meet. Well, Ukraine's defence minister spoke outside [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=26.88s)]
*  of the talks in the last half an hour. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=32.16s)]
*  So, well, now we need to exchange people and soon we will inform you what is the next stage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=55.88s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Thank you, media. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=62.88s)]
*  Well, let me bring you the latest from, of course, all those leaders that have also been [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=64.88s)]
*  speaking in the last little while. President Zelenskyy has had a call with Donald Trump [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=69.64s)]
*  and said Ukraine is ready for quick steps for peace. He said robust sanctions should [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=73.88s)]
*  follow if Russia rejects the ceasefire. President Macron has also said it's unacceptable for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=79.0s)]
*  Russia to again ignore Ukrainian ceasefire calls. And that was a line also agreed with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=85.48s)]
*  by Zakir Sama, the British prime minister. So those from the leaders in the last half [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=91.56s)]
*  an hour as well. Let's speak to Sergey Rodchenko, who is the professor at the John Hopkins School [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=96.4s)]
*  of Advanced International Studies. Thank you for being here with us. What is your analysis [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=101.2s)]
*  of what has actually been happening there in Istanbul? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=106.36s)]
*  Well, it's the expected. It's the first meeting. The sides express their initial positions and now they will take those positions back to Moscow and Kiev and see if there's any give and take. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=112.24s)]
*  What I understand is the next step, in addition to the prisoner exchange, which of course is a positive development, is that the two sides will consider ways of achieving a ceasefire and will exchange ideas to this effect, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=123.24s)]
*  which may be then followed by another round of talks, or I hope it will be followed by another round of talks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=140.12s)]
*  A little earlier, Ukrainian diplomats were saying that the Russian delegation had demanded that Ukraine withdraws forces from its territory to get that ceasefire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=145.12s)]
*  That was described as totally unacceptable and an attempt to derail these talks. Is the Russian strategy, do you think, just that long game, just continue to delay and delay and delay? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=155.12s)]
*  Not necessarily, but the Russians have been saying that they want to approach these talks and these negotiations from the position of reality. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=168.0s)]
*  What they, however, have failed to recognize is that the reality is that they have not been able to claim the territories that Russia has formally annexed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=176.0s)]
*  25% of Kherson and Zaporizhzhya remain out of reach for the Russians. They're stuck in eastern Ukraine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=187.0s)]
*  So if we recognize those realities, then we will have to have a ceasefire along the existing lines. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=193.88s)]
*  And I think it's wise for the Ukrainians to reject reposterous demands by the Russians to actually remove Ukrainian forces from the territory that Russia has failed to conquer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=199.88s)]
*  A twin final thought. In the old world order, there would be deadlines and then if the actions weren't taken, then the various threats would be imposed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=209.88s)]
*  We keep seeing in the new world order with Donald Trump, no line in the sand. So your thoughts on that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=219.76s)]
*  And another thought to weave in. Is Vladimir Putin's strategy working? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=225.76s)]
*  Because you heard Donald Trump say yesterday this only moves when Putin and I actually meet. That, of course, sidelines Ukraine itself and the Europeans. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=231.76s)]
*  Well, Putin would love to have that meeting with Trump and to get Trump to arm twist President Zelensky into agreeing to demands from Russia that he would otherwise not agree to. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=242.64s)]
*  Now is Putin winning? I don't think so. At the moment, Russia is bogged down in eastern Ukraine. The war has taken on a very attritional character. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=252.64s)]
*  As for peace talks, they can go on for a long time. There are no deadlines. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=263.52s)]
*  Peace talks in previous wars, think about the Vietnam War, the war of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, lasted for years and years before a settlement was achieved. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=267.52s)]
*  But the issue here is Donald Trump is a very impatient man and he wants quick results. Now he's not getting those results judging from what we just saw in Istanbul. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=276.52s)]
*  Yes, of course, peace talks will take many, many months, if not longer. But the initial stage, the ceasefire stage, that is what continues to elude those parties on the ground, certainly the Ukrainians. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=286.4s)]
*  Thanks very much. We will leave it there, Sergo. Thanks for joining us on the programme. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=296.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGACjDIm_8&t=300.4s)]
