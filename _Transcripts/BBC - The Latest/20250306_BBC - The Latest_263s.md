Video Description: Scientists have discovered a new part of the immune system which they say is a goldmine for potential antibiotics.
 
They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.
 
The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.
 
They added that it gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.

# Scientists discover new 'potential goldmine' part of immune system | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA)
*  Scientists have discovered that a new piece of the immune system, which could be a goldmine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=0.0s)]
*  of potential antibiotics, has been discovered. Tests reveal that proteasome, a protein recycling [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=5.0s)]
*  structure found in every cell in our body, can produce bacteria-killing chemicals when [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=11.26s)]
*  it detects infections. The importance of this is that it offers hope amid rising resistance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=16.0s)]
*  among microbes to drugs. Professor Yivat Mbil from the Weizmann Institute of Science in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=21.6s)]
*  Israel told us how they made this breakthrough. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  So as you clearly defined it, the proteasome is the garbage can of the cells, if you will. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=30.44s)]
*  And using the technology we developed way back, we actually collected the ability to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=35.44s)]
*  have dumpster diving into these garbage cans and examined which are the pieces of little [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=41.68s)]
*  proteins that are being tossed away and cleaved away like in recycling. And the discovery [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=47.72s)]
*  was actually to ask what do we see there. And when we looked inside, we actually saw [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=53.64s)]
*  that a lot of these little pieces are actually antimicrobial agents. They serve as natural [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=58.4s)]
*  antibiotics that the body all the time produces, but we didn't know anything about this process [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  before. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=68.52s)]
*  So, I mean, it seems incredible that we didn't know anything about it before, because, I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=69.52s)]
*  mean, the potential for this, we all know that people are becoming resistant to antibiotics. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=74.12s)]
*  So how can this help that in particular? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=78.6s)]
*  So we believe, and we showed it very nicely in the paper, but of course these are just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=82.4s)]
*  preliminary studies because it opens the whole field of innate immunity. But you can [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=86.32s)]
*  actually, once you identify these little pieces and you can test their effect on bacteria [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=90.44s)]
*  and show that they kill different types of bacteria, even ones that are very dangerous [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  for patients, we showed the mice that you can produce them on the outside and then provide [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  them as therapy to mice that were infected with either bacteriumia, which may cause sepsis [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  and actually kill the mice and we can save them and also have reduced tissue damage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=110.08s)]
*  And also in a model of pneumonia, which of course is a major concern. So if you can now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=114.96s)]
*  have a whole list and we found hundreds of thousands of such peptides of such little [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=120.16s)]
*  pieces, you can now try to ask whether you can give them in different combinations and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  different patients to actually try to fight infectious diseases and perhaps other diseases [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=129.6s)]
*  that are, you know, we have with immune compromised patients, like in the case of transplantations [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  and cancer patients that are awaiting therapy and so on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=141.2s)]
*  So you must have had a bit of a eureka moment when it happened because the potential for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=144.56s)]
*  this obviously you're right at the beginning of the scientific process, but the potential [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=150.0s)]
*  for this is enormous. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=154.56s)]
*  Absolutely. And we had about two eureka moments in this and this I think the best moments [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  that scientists can have. I was never working on microbiology and this came out as a complete [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=162.32s)]
*  surprise. And the eureka moment was in fact when we looked in the proteasome in the garbage can [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=168.8s)]
*  and we infected cells with bacteria, we actually saw that the scissors, the recycling being [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  operated differently, meaning it generated a different types of these little peptides. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And then we asked ourselves why that is. And we identified that if we just isolated them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  and try to allow bacteria to grow in their presence, they actually died. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay. So what's the next step? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=194.56s)]
*  There are plenty of next steps, both in the basic biology of this because the proteasome, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=196.72s)]
*  we thought we knew almost everything there is to know about it, but obviously it opens [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  up a completely different avenue to look in different tissues in different disease contexts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=205.6s)]
*  like fibrosis, autoimmunity, cancer, and so on. But from the translational perspective, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  and as you point, as you clearly stated in the beginning, we have to prepare for antibiotic [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=214.56s)]
*  resistance, which is becoming a really major issue health-wise worldwide. And so if we can now [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=220.16s)]
*  test these different types of pieces across different types of bacteria and understand [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=226.72s)]
*  whether we can have a therapy that will be provided to human beings with a natural source [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  that is not so toxic, presumably, again, we didn't prove it in humans yet, this will require clinical [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=236.88s)]
*  trials. But since the body is the generator of these products, it can actually be much safer and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=243.12s)]
*  have less side effects than we have with the chemical antibiotics that are being treated heavily [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=249.92s)]
*  today. And our thanks once again to Professor Yifat Merbel for that, well, detailing potentially a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=254.72s)]
*  real scientific breakthrough. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtCvimVHyA&t=261.12s)]
