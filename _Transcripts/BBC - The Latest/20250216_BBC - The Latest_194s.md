**BBC - The Latest:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM)
*  The Indian Prime Minister has expressed his distress over the deaths of at least 15 people in a crush at the main railway station in the capital Delhi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=0.0s)]
*  The crush took place on Saturday evening as pilgrims surged to get on trains to Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh where the Kummela Hindu festival is taking place. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=8.0s)]
*  Police spokesman said platforms became overcrowded following delays to train departures. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=18.0s)]
*  Let's get more on this while South Asia regional editor Ambarisan Ethirajan who's with me now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=23.0s)]
*  Good to see you. What more do we know about what's happened here? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=27.0s)]
*  Now the government is now releasing more details about what possibly happened on the platforms in the New Delhi railway station which is the capital's main and also one of the busiest railway stations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=30.0s)]
*  And initially there were conflicting information about whether trains were cancelled or whether there was an announcement about platform change. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=42.0s)]
*  Now the railway authorities say it was simply because of overcrowding. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=49.0s)]
*  As you may know, one of the biggest religious festivals, Hindu religious festival, Kummela is going on at the moment in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=53.0s)]
*  So millions of people have been attending this festival so people are either going there or returning from the festival to go back to their homes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=61.0s)]
*  And we also know more about the victims and one man from Bihar state said he came with the family and he saw his wife dying in front of him on the platform [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=69.0s)]
*  when they were about to board a train and he could not do anything to save her because there were so many people pushing and trampling over each other. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=78.0s)]
*  It was impossible for individuals to take care of their loved ones and some of them are in critical condition so the numbers could be higher in the next few hours or late days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=86.0s)]
*  But it has also thrown a lot of questions, especially the opposition is questioning the government about why there was no management [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=97.0s)]
*  and criticizing the government for not providing enough security and also there was giving conflicting information. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=104.0s)]
*  Initially they were denying that there was any crash and later on they said it was a stampede like situation, a crash like situation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=112.0s)]
*  But later on, according to hospital sources, then the world came to know about the casualty figures. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible, especially the description there of the man who couldn't save his wife in front of his eyes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=125.0s)]
*  And this is a second incident where we've seen a crush around the Kumbh Mela, last one a few weeks ago in which a number of people died as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=131.0s)]
*  Questions being asked about crowd control. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=138.0s)]
*  It's not very uncommon in India because India holds religious festivals or sporting events where hundreds of thousands of people, even millions of people attend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=141.0s)]
*  So whether they have learned anything from their previous experience, that's what the opposition is asking questions because the previous one, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=151.0s)]
*  according to the government, 30 people were killed during people trampled over each other when they were about to take a holy dip in the river in Prayagraj that was late last month. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=158.0s)]
*  So this is coming just a few weeks after that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=168.0s)]
*  So that is the main question by the opposition leaders about why there was not enough security. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=171.0s)]
*  But then some people say the number of people are so huge, it was really impossible for them to manage the crowd. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=176.0s)]
*  And this probably, you know, people should have learned lessons from the previous one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=184.0s)]
*  But that's why opposition says the government is not learning anything. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=188.0s)]
*  OK, embarrassing. Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbuiVCWBoM&t=191.0s)]
