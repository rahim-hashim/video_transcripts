# Israel and Iran conflict enters fourth day as both sides continue strikes | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE)
*  And we start this hour with the hostilities between Israel and Iran, which have now entered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=0.0s)]
*  a fourth day. Here are some of the latest developments from the last few hours. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=5.72s)]
*  Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, has warned that the residents of Tehran will, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=11.92s)]
*  as he puts it, pay the price for Iranian attacks on his country's citizens. He says Iran has [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=16.96s)]
*  been deliberately targeting civilian areas. Israel says the number of people killed by [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=23.0s)]
*  Iranian missiles has risen to 24 since Friday, with eight of those deaths coming overnight [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=28.28s)]
*  from Sunday into Monday. Iran's health ministry says that more than 220 people have been killed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=34.4s)]
*  in Israeli attacks since Friday. The Israeli military says it hit a command centre of Iran's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=40.92s)]
*  elite Huds Force in Tehran. And the Houthi militia in Yemen, a close ally of Iran, has [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  launched more missile strikes against targets in Israel, triggering air raid silo in several [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=53.44s)]
*  areas. Israel says there have been missile attacks against Jerusalem and Haifa overnight [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=59.0s)]
*  and also in Tel Aviv. Our BBC team there filmed these pictures. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=65.32s)]
*  Well, let's take a look at the areas which Iran has targeted with missiles. These were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=84.32s)]
*  the attacks in Haifa, this is to the north of Israel, and the location of a major port [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=92.36s)]
*  and oil refinery. These pictures were in the skies over Jerusalem. Israel says its air [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=98.48s)]
*  defence systems intercepted various threats and people were told to take cover. Meanwhile, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=105.24s)]
*  Israel says it struck military sites in central Iran. Iranian media say a military complex [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=111.2s)]
*  near the capital had been hit. Now, with BBC journalists not able to work inside Iran, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=117.56s)]
*  less footage of Israel's attacks has emerged. But late on Sunday, Iran confirmed the head [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=123.64s)]
*  of the Revolutionary Guards Intelligence Unit, Mohammed Kazemi, had been killed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=129.8s)]
*  Well, let's speak to the Director General of the Middle East Association and former [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=137.4s)]
*  UK ambassador to Iran, Nicholas Hopton. I'm Ms Hopton, thank you so much for joining us [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=141.96s)]
*  on BBC News. This is an area you know well. How concerned are you at how quickly events [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=146.52s)]
*  could escalate from where we are now? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=155.56s)]
*  Good morning. I think we're at a very pivotal moment in a very dangerous situation. I think [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=158.68s)]
*  since Israel first launched their rather unexpected, in terms of timing, the strikes Thursday night, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  things have moved very quickly. I think if Prime Minister Netanyahu had gambled on having [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=175.08s)]
*  a swift capitulation by the Iranians, that's clearly not happening. And I think the situation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=182.08s)]
*  is ramping up in terms of tension. We've seen over the last few days, many civilians [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=189.08s)]
*  on both sides. And I think today leaders come at a very important moment, not least so that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=200.8s)]
*  the President of the United States, Donald Trump, can set out his views and hear from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=209.56s)]
*  his colleagues, because the position of the United States in this conflict will be very [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=215.64s)]
*  important to how it ends and moves forward in the coming days. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mr Hopton, we are having a fair bit of break up on your line. I'm just going to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=228.0s)]
*  persevere a little bit longer because I do want to hear if possible what you've got to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=232.16s)]
*  say so hopefully that line will settle. You mentioned President Trump there. Just perhaps [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=235.6s)]
*  explain how crucial his role could be in terms of the relationship between Israel and Iran [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=240.72s)]
*  and his influence in both areas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=248.72s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu will be seeking to draw the United States into the conflict [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=253.0s)]
*  and obviously what Donald Trump decides to do will be decisive. The President of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=260.24s)]
*  United States has made clear many times that he does not like the United States being involved [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=266.36s)]
*  in foreign wars and at this stage the United States has limited its role to helping to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  defend Israel from Iranian attacks, air attacks. Now if the U.S. were to take a more front [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=276.6s)]
*  foot approach and to be directly involved in targeting Iran, Iran has also said that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=284.0s)]
*  will hold the United States responsible and to a degree already do. That will lead to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=291.12s)]
*  a rapid ramping up of hostilities and I'm sure more bloodshed on all sides. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=295.6s)]
*  Also an interesting prospect is Vladimir Putin or Russia acting as a mediator between the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=306.16s)]
*  two countries. What's the relationship like between Russia and Iran and could that help [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=311.68s)]
*  having their involvement? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=316.12s)]
*  Well Vladimir Putin of course is an unlikely peacemaker given his hostility and offensive [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  against Ukrainian sovereignty but in this instance he may have a role to play given [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  that he does seem to have a relationship of sorts with Donald Trump, the U.S. President [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=330.44s)]
*  and the relationship with Iran is close. I would say it's tactical more than anything [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=335.84s)]
*  but the Russians and the Iranians do support each other mutually in the face of their [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=342.84s)]
*  global isolation. I think whether Vladimir Putin will be able to engage with the Israelis [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=349.84s)]
*  at this stage is a different question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=356.84s)]
*  Okay Nicholas Hopton we will leave it there. Nicholas Hopton, their former UK ambassador [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=358.84s)]
*  to Iran and once again apologies for the break up on the line there at times I think it was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=363.84s)]
*  worth persevering and getting your perspective. Thank you. Well let's go now to the Middle [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=367.84s)]
*  East and talk to our correspondent Hugo Bashega who's in Peta Tikva north of Tel Aviv in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=372.84s)]
*  Israel. Hello to you Hugo, just take us through exactly where you are and the damage that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=377.84s)]
*  you are able to see. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=384.84s)]
*  Yeah it was a long night of attacks again the third consecutive night of these Iranian [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=387.84s)]
*  missile attacks responding to this Israeli campaign that started on Friday and we heard [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=393.84s)]
*  loud explosions across the country with air defense systems trying to intercept those [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=399.84s)]
*  missiles that had been fired by Iran. Not all of them were intercepted and one of them [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=404.84s)]
*  hit this building here and as you can see there is a lot of destruction. You can see [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=409.84s)]
*  this massive hole here, this is the point of impact of the missile and this is a 20 [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=413.84s)]
*  story building, residential area, there's a lot of damage as well to the nearby buildings, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=419.84s)]
*  a lot of work here underway to clean up the rubble. There is a lot of damage here, destruction [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=425.84s)]
*  to the cars that were parked here because of falling debris. So we've been talking to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=431.84s)]
*  people here and also after a long weekend of attacks and there is a different feeling [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=436.84s)]
*  now because people felt they were protected. There is obviously a very sophisticated air [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=445.84s)]
*  defense system here in Israel but what the authorities have been saying is that Iran [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=451.84s)]
*  has been using different kinds of missiles with large explosive payloads in those missiles [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=455.84s)]
*  so this is the damage that those missiles have been causing. So they've been urging [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=463.84s)]
*  the public to stay alert, there is a state of emergency here, to seek shelter when the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=468.84s)]
*  air raid alerts sound because this is what the authorities have been saying, that they [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=473.84s)]
*  expect these kinds of attacks to continue as this Israeli offensive against Iran continues [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=479.84s)]
*  as well. We don't know what the target was, the Israeli authorities have been accusing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=486.84s)]
*  Iran of deliberately targeting residential areas, we don't know whether there was a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=490.84s)]
*  different target here, this is a residential area and as you can see all these buildings [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=494.84s)]
*  have been evacuated so we're talking about hundreds, possibly thousands of people who [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=499.84s)]
*  have now been displaced because of the attack that happened here at around 4 o'clock in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=503.84s)]
*  the morning. Yeah and Hugo, just in the last few minutes those updated casualty figures [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=507.84s)]
*  of 24 people killed in Israel since Friday and it's interesting hearing you talking about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=512.8399999999999s)]
*  Israeli people because as you say there is a very sophisticated anti-missile system in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel so missiles getting through, do you get a sense of surprise from people that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=524.84s)]
*  actually these missiles are being able to break those defence systems? I think there [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=529.84s)]
*  is an element of shock, I think a lot of people are surprised perhaps with what is being happening [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=535.84s)]
*  here in the last two days even though the authorities have been saying that this is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=541.84s)]
*  very sophisticated but it isn't perfect so again they've been warning the public to stay [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=545.84s)]
*  alert, there's a state of emergency here in place and they have been indicating that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=550.84s)]
*  this campaign against Iran that they say is against the country's nuclear and military [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=556.84s)]
*  facilities is going to be a prolonged offensive so we're possibly talking about weeks not [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=562.84s)]
*  days and they say that attacks like these are likely to continue, the Iranian authorities [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=567.84s)]
*  are about to respond to these attacks, they have described these Israeli attacks as aggression [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=573.84s)]
*  and that they have the right to defend themselves so again the message from the Israeli authorities [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=579.84s)]
*  to the population here is to remain alert, seek shelter, there is a very strong system [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=585.84s)]
*  in place but it isn't perfect. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=591.84s)]
*  Okay Hugo Vasega, Petar Tikva, just north of Tel Aviv, thank you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cBGBmEMsE&t=593.84s)]
