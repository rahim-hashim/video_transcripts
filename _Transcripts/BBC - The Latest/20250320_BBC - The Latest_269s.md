Video Description: The latest Israeli strikes have killed at least 85 more Palestinians across the Gaza Strip according to local health officials.  They say at least 592 people have now been killed in the past three days, after Israel unilaterally ended a ceasefire agreement.

Hamas fired three rockets at Israel in response to the latest airstrikes, without causing casualties.   Itâ€™s the first time Hamas has fired rockets at Israel since it ended the truce. 

The Israeli military said it was again enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza including Gaza City. Palestinians can no longer enter the north of the territory, the military said, and are only allowed to move south on foot using the coastal road.

*  in Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  And in a cemetery with tombstones made of rubble and breeze blocks from destroyed homes, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Omar is laid to rest in a shallow grave. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=142.4s)]
*  The flicker of hope the brief ceasefire offered is now gone. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=148.4s)]
*  Schools are once again closed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=154.2s)]
*  So children are having to teach themselves. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=157.6s)]
*  Her friends in front of her, 13-year-old Judy, leads the class. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=161.68s)]
*  Schools in Gaza have now been shut for almost 16 of the last 18 months. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=168.56s)]
*  I feel fear and sadness because there will be bloodshed again. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=173.68s)]
*  There won't be security and safety anymore. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=178.96s)]
*  When we had the ceasefire, we felt a bit safe. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=181.12s)]
*  I could go to school and we were happy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=183.56s)]
*  For Gaza families, the daily struggle to survive goes on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=186.84s)]
*  Israel says they face complete destruction if Hamas isn't eliminated and the hostage [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=191.24s)]
*  is returned. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=196.8s)]
*  And we can speak to John, who's in Jerusalem for us tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=197.8s)]
*  John, Hamas have not reacted militarily to Israel ending the ceasefire until now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  No, look, their military capability has clearly been massively diminished, but today they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=207.8s)]
*  wanted to send a message and for the first time in a long time they fired three rockets [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=215.56s)]
*  out towards Tel Aviv. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=221.12s)]
*  Two of them landed in open areas and one was shot down by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=222.76s)]
*  shield. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=230.4s)]
*  But the Israelis are also wanting to send a message. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=232.06s)]
*  The message is not just to Hamas and the people of Gaza, but it's also to the Israeli public, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=235.44s)]
*  many of whom want the war to continue. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=241.88s)]
*  And basically that message is we need to finish the job and we're going to continue until [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=245.08s)]
*  Hamas is completely destroyed and all the hostages are freed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=253.0s)]
*  And the sad fact is that as the days progress, even though negotiations are continuing, that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=259.48s)]
*  the worst could still be to come. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4zh_31IIo&t=266.56s)]
