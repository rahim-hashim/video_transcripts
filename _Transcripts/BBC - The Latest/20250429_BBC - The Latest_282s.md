Video Description: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country will only enter trade and security talks with President Donald Trump "on our terms", adding that Canada deserves respect from the US. 
 
In a world exclusive interview, Carney told the BBC he would only visit Washington when there was a "serious discussion to be had" that respected Canada's sovereignty.
 
Since Trump's re-election to the White House, the US president has repeatedly mentioned making Canada the "51st state" of America, which has infuriated Canadians.
 
Carney, who secured a historic victory for his Liberal Party in a snap election on Monday, said such a scenario was "never, ever going to happen".
 
He has been speaking to the BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam.

# Canada will deal with US 'on our own terms' Mark Carney tells BBC | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw)
*  What will your message be to Donald Trump down south? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it will be the same message that I've given him directly and I've been saying publicly, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=3.88s)]
*  which is that we're two sovereign nations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=8.76s)]
*  There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership to be had. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=12.84s)]
*  It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=16.76s)]
*  But also, we've got lots of other things to do. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=19.6s)]
*  We can build out our economy here at home. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=22.68s)]
*  We are in the process of building our relationships more deeply in Europe, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=25.16s)]
*  elsewhere around the world. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=28.84s)]
*  So we'll have a partnership on our terms. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=29.84s)]
*  There's a win-win possibility there, but on our terms, not on their terms. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=33.96s)]
*  Will you visit him quickly? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=38.08s)]
*  It depends. I've been to Washington. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=40.0s)]
*  I've been to the White House. I've seen it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=42.36s)]
*  I've seen all the monuments. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=43.72s)]
*  I've been to Florida even. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=45.64s)]
*  So I'm not going as a tourist. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I'll go when there's a serious discussion to be had. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  When there's respect for Canada's sovereignty? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=50.64s)]
*  Yes. And look, the president, I would distinguish between what the president wants [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=53.0s)]
*  and what the president expects. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  Yes, he has this view of his territorial views. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=61.96s)]
*  That's never, ever going to happen with respect to Canada. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=67.48s)]
*  Frankly, I don't think it's ever going to happen with respect to any other [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=71.0s)]
*  of whether it's Panama or Greenland or elsewhere. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=74.28s)]
*  So the question is, when are we ready to have that discussion? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=77.88s)]
*  Remembering that we are the biggest client for more than 40 states. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=81.84s)]
*  Remember that we supply them with vital energy, both conventional energy, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=86.36s)]
*  and potentially could supply them with critical minerals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=90.72s)]
*  Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertilizers, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=93.96s)]
*  70% of their fertilizer and beyond. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  So we deserve respect. We expect respect. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=99.32s)]
*  And I'm sure we'll get it in due course again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  And then we can have these discussions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=108.0s)]
*  This trade war is not just about North America. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=109.84s)]
*  It's kind of global now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=111.84s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago that you were wanting to do more deals [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  with reliable trade partners. Europe. What about the UK? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=118.76s)]
*  What about the UK? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=122.68s)]
*  What about the UK? I mean, there was there was a shout out the other day in Saskatoon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=123.48s)]
*  There was there was something on the table. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  There was there was an issue around cheese. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=129.32s)]
*  Do you think you can do a Canada-UK free trade agreement? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=131.6s)]
*  Surely. It's low hanging fruit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=134.68s)]
*  One would think. One would think. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=136.36s)]
*  I mean, it's one of these situations where I forget the exact figure, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=138.08s)]
*  but it's 95, 97% of our trade is effectively tariff free [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=141.64s)]
*  between Canada and the United Kingdom, although that's slightly more [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=145.96s)]
*  narrow way of looking at it because we could expand the level of integration [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=148.92s)]
*  between between our countries, like-minded countries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=153.12s)]
*  You think about defense partnerships and those conversations have just just begun. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=156.56s)]
*  So there's a lot that we can do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=160.84s)]
*  And of course, it's in our interest to diversify. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=162.56s)]
*  We're definitely going to do that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=165.16s)]
*  We have many options. The UK is one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=166.68s)]
*  I would suggest it's also in the UK's interest to diversify. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=168.96s)]
*  It's that process of post-Brexit diversification hasn't maybe moved as fast as some have expected. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=172.08s)]
*  There's a G7 summit due in just a few weeks time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=177.96s)]
*  That sort of coincides with the 90 day deadline on the reciprocal tariffs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=181.16s)]
*  It makes it perhaps the most important G7 summit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=185.36s)]
*  I think it's yes. Sorry. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  I think it is a very important summit because you have what you just mentioned. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=190.88s)]
*  You have the NATO summit, which comes within a week, 10 days. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=195.12s)]
*  Afterwards, but you also have, you know, the kaleidoscope, if you will, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=198.88s)]
*  has been shaken in terms of the international trading arrangements. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=202.92s)]
*  Countries are getting used to the uncertainty. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=206.48s)]
*  And the question is, well, what are we going to put back together? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=208.88s)]
*  What is going to settle, particularly amongst like-minded countries? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=211.64s)]
*  The G7 are supposed to be the most like-minded of like-minded countries. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  We're going to put that to the test and and look to move forward. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=220.44s)]
*  Plus, if I may add, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=224.16s)]
*  President Zelensky will be there for part of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=226.68s)]
*  And again, a situation that is coming to a head. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Here in Canada, of course, here in Canada, here in Alberta. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=232.4s)]
*  Can I ask you, you're welcome to come back. It's beautiful. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=234.8s)]
*  That time here is fantastic. It is actually fantastic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=237.08s)]
*  And then it was just just one last question. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Central bankers, you know, yes, yes, you know, they they they they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=242.56s)]
*  they there's there's jobs, there's careers after after leading central banks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=247.24s)]
*  There's careers after journalism. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=252.0s)]
*  It's amazing that you've been working. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=254.2s)]
*  But but yeah, central banker, prime minister, which is better? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=256.68s)]
*  There's a time and place for everything. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=263.0s)]
*  And I was privileged to be governor of the Bank of England, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  governor of the Bank of Canada at a crucial time in both respects. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=267.8s)]
*  And of course, I'm looking for the honour of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=272.0s)]
*  being prime minister of Canada at a critical time for our country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=276.4s)]
*  Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you very much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZCFtkqfEmw&t=280.4s)]
