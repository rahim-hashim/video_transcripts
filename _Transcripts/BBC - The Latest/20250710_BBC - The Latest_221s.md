*  There could be six million new HIV infections and four million more AIDS-related deaths [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=0.0s)]
*  globally by the year 2029 due to the sweeping aid cuts by the US. That's according to the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=6.8s)]
*  UN, which is releasing a report on global HIV infections today, its first since the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=13.4s)]
*  cuts took effect. It's being announced in South Africa, the country with the highest [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=18.76s)]
*  number of people living with HIV and home to the world's leading HIV researchers, whose [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=23.16s)]
*  work could be set back years as a result of the US actions. Here's our Africa correspondent [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=28.36s)]
*  Mayani Jones in Johannesburg on the global impact it could have. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=33.72s)]
*  A lifeline for thousands. This private clinic in northern Johannesburg used to receive USAID [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=37.92s)]
*  funding. We visited when the cuts were first announced and some of its patients were anxious [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=45.84s)]
*  about their impact. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=51.84s)]
*  Firstly when I was sick without the clinic or attending the clinic, my life was so bad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=53.84s)]
*  Since I get the treatment from Vet Copen clinic, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. There is no [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  problem about me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=65.80000000000001s)]
*  What would you say to Americans who say that American taxpayers shouldn't be paying for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  health care in South Africa? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=72.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no. That is not a good idea. We are all women being, they mustn't separate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=73.84s)]
*  This is Africa, this is America. Please. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=80.52s)]
*  Although this clinic is still open, dozens have closed their doors. Scientists here are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  warning this could lead to a spike in infections. The public health system is stretched and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=90.32s)]
*  can absorb all the patients who used to get their care from USAID funded initiatives. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  And frontline health care is in the only affected area. These scientists are working on a vaccine [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=105.08s)]
*  for HIV, but most of their funding came from the US. When President Trump pulled the plug, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=110.26s)]
*  they managed to secure some emergency funds, but it won't be enough. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=116.18s)]
*  When the stop order came, that meant we had to stop everything and it's only been some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=121.54s)]
*  of us who have been able to get additional funding that we could continue. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  How disruptive was that interruption? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=131.66s)]
*  Extremely disruptive. It's as bad as months, probably could even be a year or so. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=134.42s)]
*  The benefit of developing and testing vaccines on the continent is that it makes them cheaper. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=142.5s)]
*  Following the US funding cuts, some of this work may now have to be completed in the US [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  or in Europe where vaccine trials are more expensive. This might mean that any vaccine [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=153.1s)]
*  that's developed could be unaffordable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=158.17999999999998s)]
*  Many of the developments in HIV prevention, which have benefited patients around the world, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=162.66s)]
*  were trialled here in South Africa. Now the country's researchers say they need emergency [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=167.38s)]
*  funding if this work is to continue. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  South African researchers were the ones who did the pivotal trials on a lot of these treatment [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=175.38s)]
*  regimens, a lot of the HIV prevention tools and drugs, but we're not on top of HIV yet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=180.9s)]
*  We're only managing HIV, we're not preventing HIV. So it's still there, we still need a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=188.42s)]
*  vaccine against HIV and that's where we need to continue doing research. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=194.26s)]
*  The South African government and international donors have pledged some 54 million dollars [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=198.94s)]
*  to plug some of the US funding cuts. But given that last year the Americans spent 450 million [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=203.61999999999998s)]
*  dollars on HIV funding to South Africa, this bailout won't be enough to cover the need. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  This could have devastating consequences for global health. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vqz2ti4KjY&t=214.78s)]
