Video Description: The long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza has come into force after a last-minute delay, with displaced Palestinians beginning to return to the cities they fled.

The first three Israeli female hostages are expected to be freed later - Hamas has named them as 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher, dual British-Israeli Emily Damari, 28, and 24-year-old Romi Gonen.

A Red Cross team in the Gaza Strip is on its way to collect the hostages ahead of being handed over to Israeli authorities, Israeli media and Reuters news agency reports.

*  Often in the more central and northern parts of the strip [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=172.32s)]

*  Really thronging the roads in cars and trucks other people loading what they can onto carts pulled by donkeys [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=179.12s)]

*  and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=212.12s)]
*  Pro-hamas media in Gaza have also been reporting against something which was expected as part of this deal Israeli forces withdrawing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=213.56s)]
*  from certain areas that have been agreed under the framework of the deal moving away from the more populated areas and pulling back to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=221.36s)]
*  more [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=228.8s)]
*  Secure areas and they will eventually leave Gaza altogether as part of this deal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=229.84s)]
*  Now it has been an extraordinarily busy day today [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=236.44s)]
*  And it is not over yet those pictures that I was telling you about mark the starts of the release of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=239.2s)]
*  three [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Israeli hostages three of 33 who are going to be released during this part of the deal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=246.16s)]
*  And we can talk to Yakov Patsy's with me a former editor of the Jerusalem Post among many other things [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=251.0s)]
*  Just tell me I always think it's really useful actually for people outside Israel to know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  How these moments are such a big part of the Israeli consciousness how the the hostages their identities their faces [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=262.2s)]
*  Their stories have never been far from people's minds here. I think you're 100% right [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=268.86s)]
*  There's not an Israeli who doesn't know the names of the people who are being released Emily the ron and Romy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=273.66s)]
*  Who's been waiting? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=280.3s)]
*  I don't think there will be a dry eye in all of Israel as we speak as this process begins and the hostages start to come [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  on this has been a painful [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=288.5s)]
*  471 days not just obviously for the families and for the hostages themselves [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=290.66s)]
*  But all of Israel has been scarred by this what happened on October 7th and the fact that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=295.38s)]
*  251 people were taken by the mass on that dark day [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  This is the beginning of what could be a healing process that this nation so desperately needs at this moment [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=304.42s)]
*  Let's talk about that because [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=310.5s)]
*  There is still there's still a lot going on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=312.82s)]
*  Domestically politically in Israel the ceasefire deal has started, but not everybody here is happy about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=316.26s)]
*  It's a bit crazy when you think about it to some extent right this is should be something of a moment of celebration [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=322.66s)]
*  straight the fact that finally these people who we have yearned prayed cried hoped for our [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=328.86s)]
*  Tears have poured out our hearts were all broken you would expect our government ministers to be celebrating this moment in time [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=335.22s)]
*  But instead we're looking at political upheaval instead [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  It looks like the Netanyahu's government might be teetering it might stay together [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  But it's now starting to crumble a bit the Ben Gehr party has pulled out officially resigning Smutrich the finance minister [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=348.62s)]
*  His party for the time being at least is staying in but they've said that if it goes to the second stage of this deal [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=355.34s)]
*  Because let's remember only 33 Anna are being released in the next 42 days [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=361.58s)]
*  There's still 65 or so who are being held in Gaza Smutrich wants to see the war continue before those 65 come back [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=365.58s)]
*  That's a little crazy when you think about what this country and what these people have been through [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  A day that we're able to get our people back these women are alive. They've been waiting for us as a nation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=378.58s)]
*  We have let them down now is the time to mark [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=384.78s)]
*  I don't want to celebrate with joy because this is a painful moment [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  We're paying a steep price releasing murderers, but this is a moment that we can say we've done a good thing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=391.86s)]
*  We're bringing back alive people and bringing them home to their country to their families and to have a future that they were being denied [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=397.41999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=405.06s)]
*  Obviously the events of the 7th of October are seared into everybody's minds here [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=406.86s)]
*  And when that war was launched in Gaza, the Israeli government said that what they were trying to do was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=411.22s)]
*  Was make people here safe and secure now at this stage [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=417.02000000000004s)]
*  There has been lives lost on the Palestinian side Israeli soldiers have lost their lives [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=421.22s)]
*  It has been a devastating 15 months do people here and I mean lots of people here don't speak with one voice [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=425.98s)]
*  But in general do you think Israelis feel safer as a result of what's happened to Hamas in Gaza? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=432.64s)]
*  It's an interesting point you're making because Israelis are divided to some extent [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=438.32s)]
*  But I think that what we have to realize is from October 7th [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=443.32s)]
*  We'd lost the war already then when Hamas was able to invade our country massacre 1200 of our people take [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=446.72s)]
*  251 more hostages men women children [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=454.04s)]
*  Holocaust survivors some of them not alive half of the hostages are presumed only to be alive out of the 98 that are left there [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  This was a moment that there wasn't going to be a decisive victory the likes of which we we like to watch in movies or what [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=464.56s)]
*  Used to happen in World War two for example [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=470.44s)]
*  This was always going to be lopsided the victory that we can take for ourselves [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=473.04s)]
*  I feel at least is getting these people home is bringing Romi [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=476.8s)]
*  Emily and de ron and all the other hostages that are waiting for us to get them back home [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=480.64s)]
*  That's the victory for Israel, and that's how we should I would hope that we would look at it that way [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  But there are threats Hamas as you mentioned earlier is regaining is reconstituting. They're still fighters. They have armed men [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=489.12s)]
*  They're celebrating as their survival [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=496.08s)]
*  They will still pose a threat to Israel in the future and we have to make sure that together as a united front the world [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=498.12s)]
*  The United Kingdom the United States and others to prevent Hamas from being able to reconstitute [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  Reable to regovern and establish its governance over Gaza [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=508.8s)]
*  That's just as important for the future of stability here in the region [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=511.92s)]
*  And you talked about the phases of this deal the fact that not all of those remaining hostages are in that initial [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=515.52s)]
*  33 the fact that we actually need to get quite a way through this process to try and secure [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=521.28s)]
*  the release of those remaining hostages, so [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=526.08s)]
*  Do you think this agreement will hold do you think it will go all the way through to phase three? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=529.28s)]
*  I hope it will but I have to recognize that there are a lot of things that could go wrong [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=534.4s)]
*  Just over the next 42 days remember the way this deal is structured [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=540.12s)]
*  We're getting three today another three or four next week every seven days and with little small batch until the final 40 [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=543.36s)]
*  At the end of the 42 days we get the last 12. That's the total 33 and day 16 of this 42 day period [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=549.64s)]
*  They're supposed to commence negotiations for the second stage. We all know how much can go wrong [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=556.42s)]
*  We're also faced against Hamas cynical [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=562.16s)]
*  Barbaric terrorist organization that they could say one thing today and tomorrow change their mind [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=565.76s)]
*  They're not a rule of law government like Israel. They could decide to just violate the agreement [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=570.76s)]
*  This is makes everybody concerned especially the families of the hostages that while we'll celebrate and mark the great moment [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=576.48s)]
*  That these three are coming home [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=584.36s)]
*  They're still a long way until all of the 98 will be safe and return to Israel [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=585.8399999999999s)]

*  Ever since the moment that that ceasefire was supposed to come into force at 830 this morning was delayed for several hours [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=601.8s)]
*  1115 local time by the time the IDF stopped striking targets inside Gaza and by the time things eventually got on track [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=610.4s)]
*  I just want to show you some live pictures at this point as well of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=618.88s)]

*  International journalists are unable to enter Gaza to report on the situation there [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=629.68s)]
*  So I want to show you as many live pictures as possible and and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=634.56s)]
*  Speak to people in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=638.92s)]
*  In those areas as well in Hanyun is that you can see here [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=641.4s)]
*  You can see as well a lot of the destruction, you know 15 months of war have really left an indelible and very obvious [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=645.56s)]
*  physical mark on [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  Gaza on Hanyun is [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=656.24s)]
*  You can really see the the impact that it's had, you know the way that it has [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=658.8s)]
*  Taken out whole buildings whole streets in many cases [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=664.72s)]
*  Gonna show you some pictures as well of Rafa down in the the south of Gaza again [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  the situation there, you know a lot of the people from the north and the center of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=674.96s)]
*  Gaza ended up moving south at one point [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=680.44s)]
*  You know almost the entire population of Gaza had moved from those northern and central areas and moved all the way down [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  to Rafa, you know people [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=690.48s)]
*  Without homes [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=693.0s)]
*  overcrowded no infrastructure a really really difficult situation [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  now I want to talk to Ibrahim is better who is a [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=698.64s)]
*  Palestinian who was living in Gaza, but managed to flee in March of 2024 [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=702.32s)]
*  Ibrahim, thank you for joining us. Just share with us if you would your story [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=708.4s)]
*  We've been talking about the people who've been unable to leave Gaza you you managed to get out [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=713.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for this opportunity [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=718.88s)]
*  Actually [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=721.8s)]
*  Our story it's like any other Palestinian [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=722.84s)]
*  We flee seven times from Shida neighborhood then to the middle area then to Hanyun and then to Rafa back to Hanyun [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=725.88s)]
*  Then again to Rafa after that we got the chance to be in Egypt [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=733.16s)]
*  to be honest I [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=737.68s)]
*  Can't be say that's we were lucky to have the opportunity to move out from this devastating war [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=740.24s)]
*  At the beginning it's supposed to be like as they mentioned it's against Hamas [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=747.28s)]
*  But it was against everything as we saw today the picture for the area in the north and in the south [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=751.68s)]
*  There were was the tanks we were shocked that the number of dead body [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=757.74s)]
*  Located in that area and nobody could report it or even their family [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=763.12s)]
*  They're still searching for this these people so it was like it wasn't war [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=768.12s)]
*  It was like a worst nightmare ever and it till this moment. We still traumatize [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=773.96s)]
*  Amount of the destruction amount of killed amount of the horrible stories that we usually heard from there [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=780.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because even though you're not there [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=790.44s)]
*  You and people like you are I know you're still in constant contact with friends family members as much as you can be of course [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=793.08s)]
*  Communications being as difficult as they are in Gaza often the the comms networks just aren't working [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  But when you do speak to friends and loved ones that what have they been telling you about how life is now? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=804.72s)]
*  It wasn't easy last month last time during the war I speak with my brother [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  It was during BBC we were doing a live me and him together [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  It was like it was two weeks or three weeks ago today. I have the opportunity to speak with my brother [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=820.08s)]
*  He's still in [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=826.52s)]
*  Still in the rafa I spoke with him today for the first time we spoke like 10 minutes [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=828.64s)]
*  I never had this opportunity because of the lake of a connection lake of internet [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=834.28s)]
*  But this time today we speak we share a story with each other [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=839.84s)]
*  We didn't have this opportunity before [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=844.72s)]
*  But today once they announced the ceasefire [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  We see we like we share like a stories what we are going to do if this [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=849.8s)]
*  We have reached the agreement and back to Gaza slip because we usually like working together [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=855.76s)]
*  I love his kids. We supposed to be one family, but right now we are like we are separated [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  My family father-in-law in the north my sister and their elbalah my brother and can you on this or in Rafa? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=868.08s)]
*  Sorry, and me and my father here in Egypt, so it wasn't easy like [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=873.64s)]
*  We supposed to be in one place together working together [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=878.44s)]
*  But right now like we are separated and not by our chance we are forced to be separated [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=882.16s)]
*  So it's not easy but like when I have chance today [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  I spoke with him I spoke with my sister like even my mom [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=890.76s)]
*  But two weeks ago even we couldn't have the chance to speak with each other [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=895.12s)]
*  Because there was no connection but right now we spoke with each other [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=900.04s)]
*  We saw we spoke about my mom spoke about everything that happened and we are what we are going to do [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=903.6999999999999s)]
*  And what's what our dream and what left from our dream right now [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=909.72s)]
*  Obviously as you were saying, you know [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=917.52s)]
*  The the difficulties of being there the trauma of being there and of leaving but of still when you can talking to my and your [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=919.1600000000001s)]
*  brother and took to other family members [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=925.52s)]
*  It's enormously difficult to do that from outside Gaza. You must [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=927.6s)]
*  Think of a time when you can go back. I mean that that time obviously isn't isn't right now, but [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=931.84s)]
*  Do you ever consider when that might be [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=938.24s)]
*  Actually for me like when I think about this I think after that second part of the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=942.2s)]
*  Agreement of ceasefire because in the first part till this moment the border is not open [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=948.16s)]
*  Indeed the a truck into to Gaza St right now for honor and other NGOs [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=953.44s)]
*  But for the people for passenger till this moment they didn't open but we believe like after one weeks from now [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=958.4s)]
*  They will open the door for the people who want to travel from Gaza St [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=964.04s)]
*  But still no idea about the people who are still trapped here in Egypt because like we are speaking about 100,000 people [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=968.48s)]
*  They are here in Egypt. So [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  Most of them they are waiting the announcement or what's the process to go back to Gaza? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=977.7199999999999s)]
*  We hear the rumors that if you want to go to Gaza, you have to coordinate with the embassy and the embassy [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=981.9599999999999s)]
*  They will coordinate with different parties then they will allow you to go to Gaza [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=988.0s)]
*  But I think after that second part of the agreement of ceasefire [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=992.12s)]
*  I imagine that's a difficult decision to make because we've talked about how how complicated that the ceasefire is and the fact that while [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=999.44s)]
*  People hope that it holds it might not and for you to go back to Gaza [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1006.72s)]
*  If the ceasefire doesn't hold getting out a second time would would be really difficult [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1010.72s)]
*  Even like, you know before this agreement and today that's the picture we saw from the north we [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  We lost the hope that in one time we will back to the north because like once [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1023.76s)]
*  According to the speech from the Israeli government. They want to control they would [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  They was like to manage Gaza St. So we think that's like we will never back to Gaza St [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1036.24s)]
*  But right now with this in use with the people wins back to the north [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1042.24s)]
*  So we still have this hope and this opportunity. So I believe once they announced the opening of the borders [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1046.24s)]
*  I believe I will take the decision and back and for sure the next five years [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1052.16s)]
*  It will be not easy for us, but at least we still in our homes. We still in our land and this is a good things [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1056.92s)]
*  As you say the the reconstruction will take a really really long time [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1063.48s)]
*  As you rightly say and just when we look at the pictures of how things are in Gaza [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1067.96s)]
*  How many buildings have been destroyed? It's clear how long it will take when you look back to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1071.72s)]
*  Your life before the 7th of October and it's important to say that life in Gaza was incredibly difficult already [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1077.8s)]
*  But which parts of your life were destroyed? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1085.4s)]
*  You know when you think about Gaza what comes into your mind [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1087.48s)]
*  Actually [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1091.96s)]
*  Everything was easy. We were a family have friends everything's [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1093.5600000000002s)]
*  During the wars we lost everything's even like as a family right now like we are like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1099.0s)]
*  Being a part is not easy [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1105.64s)]
*  But we are happy to be part of it [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1108.2s)]
*  We lost everything's even like as a family right now like we are like [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  Being a part is not easy for us because we used to be one family together [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  What happened during the war? It wasn't easy [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1120.68s)]
*  Like I still remember my mom was needed dialysis three times per week [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1123.72s)]
*  So I still remember the difficulties for this [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1129.0s)]
*  When we in al-aqsa medical hospital, it wasn't easy to go there. There's no transportation [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  I remember we went there with the local transportation. There's no car. No fuel after that. We went to rapa [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1138.1200000000001s)]
*  It was only one one hospital for like two thousand or three [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1144.8400000000001s)]
*  thousand patients 17 machine for three thousand so [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1149.72s)]
*  It wasn't easy. It was a nightmare [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1154.68s)]
*  But as a Palestinian, we believe this is our fate [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1157.56s)]
*  We couldn't do anything for this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1161.72s)]
*  At least right now [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's say it's a new start a new a new beginning and we have to start fresh and start to rebuild gaza as I have mentioned [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1166.2s)]
*  Next five years. It won't be easy [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1174.44s)]
*  I couldn't imagine today like a lot of people send me a picture for our homes and our street [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1176.68s)]
*  I couldn't recognize my mom my streets like i've been there like for 20 years. I couldn't recognize the streets [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1182.2s)]
*  building everything [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1190.44s)]
*  Because of the amount of destruction there [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1192.28s)]

*  Of the southern part of gaza. We've seen the sight of [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1217.72s)]
*  Some israeli air force helicopters in the sky there because the timing suggests we were told that the uh, the handover [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1221.0800000000002s)]
*  Um of the hostages was due to begin so in southern israel [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1229.4s)]
*  Raying around the military base there. You can see helicopters in the sky people here in hostages square in tel aviv [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1233.4s)]
*  Are also they're watching israeli news on the big screen over there [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1239.48s)]
*  They are looking at pictures from inside gaza pictures [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1243.72s)]
*  Which in many ways actually mirror the ones that we saw from the first ceasefire in the first hostage release people in the streets [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1248.28s)]
*  Of gaza with their phones in the air [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1255.32s)]
*  filming [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1258.26s)]
*  What is going on? So just to remind you this handover process? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1259.72s)]
*  Begins with the red cross actually accepting the hostages and we've seen their vehicles actually on the moving gaza as well [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1265.0s)]
*  Accepting the hostages taking them and then handing them over to the idf [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1272.76s)]
*  At the edge of gaza who then check them over and fly them to [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1277.32s)]
*  We believe the shiba hospital here in israel is where all three of them [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1282.12s)]
*  Are coming to all three of those women who are being released [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1286.76s)]
*  There will be psychological checks. There will be physical checks [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1290.52s)]
*  Because of course they have been in captivity now for [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1295.08s)]
*  470 days an enormously long time. So we know that their rehabilitation [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1298.26s)]
*  Um will be a long and potentially a complex one [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1303.8200000000002s)]
*  But it looks very much like that that first part that hostage handover [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1308.06s)]
*  Is now actually happening. So we'll keep showing you these these live pictures when we get them [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1312.8600000000001s)]
*  But I also want to bring in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1317.5800000000002s)]

*  Yes, so my um older sister [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1340.54s)]
*  lian lived on kabutz berry just a few miles from the border with with gaza [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1343.26s)]
*  With my brother-in-law ellie shirabi and their two daughters 16 year old noya and 13 year old yahel [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1349.4199999999998s)]
*  Uh lian noya and yahel were murdered in their home by hamas terrorists who invaded the uh the kabutz [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1356.06s)]
*  And ellie was taken hostage to gaza as was his brother yossi [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1363.02s)]
*  Yossi was killed in captivity in january of last year [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1369.58s)]
*  It seems as a result of an idf [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1376.3799999999999s)]
*  Airstrike on the building he was being held in with noah argamani and itaïs firski [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1379.1799999999998s)]
*  My brother-in-law ellie shirabi remains a hostage in gaza [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1385.5s)]
*  the one and only piece of information we've ever had about him is [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1390.06s)]
*  Dates back to november of 2023 which was merely that he was a hostage in gaza since that time we've had no [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1394.9399999999998s)]
*  proof of life or indeed conversely proof of of death so [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1402.62s)]
*  We're now waiting to to find out what his fate is as his name is on the list of uh of of 33 hostages [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1406.9399999999998s)]
*  Who are to be released? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1414.14s)]
*  And at a moment like this stephen when [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  I remember talking during the last east fire to a hostage family member like yourself and and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1422.22s)]
*  And him describing how at a moment like this where you see some hostages being released [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1428.3000000000002s)]
*  We're still watching these live pictures of helicopters in the sky [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1433.8200000000002s)]
*  And he said you know for some people the nightmare is coming to an end and for them you are so happy [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1437.0200000000002s)]
*  But you know when you know that your own situation continues and that you're not going to see your own loved ones [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1441.98s)]
*  It's such a difficult difficult mix of emotions at a moment like this [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1447.18s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it's certainly bittersweet. I mean obviously every every hostage family primarily wants their own hostage [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1452.06s)]
*  Their own relative back. That's uh, that's understandable. That's that's human nature. So, of course there is [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1458.3s)]
*  An element of uh of disappointment and sadness that it's not ellie's turn at this stage [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1464.94s)]
*  However, all of us hostage families are [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1471.26s)]
*  A member of a a wider family of a fraternity brought about by horrific circumstance [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1474.54s)]
*  But we feel each other's sorrow, but we also feel each other's joy. So [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1480.1399999999999s)]
*  Whilst obviously i'm disappointed that ellie's not coming out yet [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1485.42s)]
*  I'm delighted that the three are coming out particularly. Um emily because i've spent some time with emily's [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1489.34s)]
*  remarkable mother mandy [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  Um, we've we've campaigned together and and spent some time together and some of emily's wider family [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1499.48s)]
*  So I have a an even deeper personal connection with them [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  so it's you know, I I shed some tears this morning when uh, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1509.0800000000002s)]
*  When it was confirmed that that emily was one of the names on on the list. So [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1513.16s)]
*  As I say it is it is bittersweet [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1517.96s)]
*  But all of us share in each other's joy in the way that we've shared in each other's uh, sorrow at times as well [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1519.96s)]
*  Stephen I know there's no definitive answer to this just yet, but what is your understanding? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1529.5600000000002s)]
*  Of at what stage in the ceasefire agreement ellie might be released [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1534.76s)]
*  Well, I think all we know is pretty much what's what's publicly known that there will be [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  Three or four hostages released every week for five weeks on a on a saturday [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1545.5600000000002s)]
*  And it seems that in week six the 12 or the 14 remaining may well be many dead bodies [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1550.6000000000001s)]
*  Now we understand that the order in which the hostages will come out are women and children first [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1558.52s)]
*  um, uh [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1563.96s)]
*  All of whom will be alive and then it will be the remaining live male hostages [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1565.56s)]
*  now [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1570.76s)]
*  I [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1571.8799999999999s)]
*  Assume that ellie will not will not be out until at least week three or four [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1572.84s)]
*  But because we don't know his status at all. We could be waiting until [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1578.12s)]
*  Really 24 hours before the final, uh, the final release in week six [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1583.1599999999999s)]
*  before we're [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1587.64s)]
*  Definitive about whether he's alive or dead. So [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1589.24s)]
*  We're going to have an intense week each week building up to the friday where the families of uh of the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1592.28s)]
*  The to be released hostages will be informed [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1599.72s)]
*  um, and then the I suppose the disappointment and deflation [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1602.6s)]
*  naturally when it's uh when it when it's not him, but uh [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1607.08s)]
*  We just as we have for the last 15 months live in hope keep everything crossed and uh, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1610.68s)]
*  And hope that when when we do get that tap on the shoulder that it's to tell us that ellie is coming home alive [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1615.96s)]
*  You talked about the unity and the support that you get from from fellow members of that that group brought together in the most terrible [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1625.96s)]
*  Circumstances that group of hostage families who I know have really supported each other and and lent on each other [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1632.98s)]
*  I wonder you know people around the world have have seen the strength that has been displayed there [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1639.24s)]
*  How do you [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1644.36s)]
*  Day by day, you know deal with this thing that is always there [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1645.72s)]
*  Do you do you think about the moment when you see him again? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1648.84s)]
*  Do you try and keep it out of your mind because for most of us steven we can never [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1651.56s)]
*  You know, we can't begin to imagine what you and people like you have been going through. How do you deal with it? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1655.0s)]
*  Well, I think uh [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  the original attack in in october of 2023 brought the [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1663.6399999999999s)]
*  the rawest and most visceral of emotions and grief and bereavement but uh [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1667.72s)]
*  When we found out that ellie was a hostage that uh that grief was [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1672.76s)]
*  I've had to sort of bury that down in order to do what I can to to influence things to get him home safely [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1676.76s)]
*  But it's always it's always there. It's it's something that we are never going to get over [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1683.48s)]
*  Um, it's just we have to find a way to to deal with it and get through it [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1688.92s)]
*  Generally, I try to make sure that the highs are not too high and the lows are not too low. So you try and keep a [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1694.28s)]
*  um an equilibrium in in your life because [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1701.24s)]
*  If you allow yourself to get too excited too elated too high about [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1705.16s)]
*  Rumors about what might happen the crash afterwards is is too much to bear [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1709.8799999999999s)]
*  Similarly, if you if you let the negatives get too much on on top of you, you won't be able to function [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1715.4s)]
*  it's natural that there will be a fallout from all of this once uh [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1721.72s)]
*  Once ellie comes out one way or the other that will bring a sense of closure to this [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1726.9199999999998s)]
*  first nightmarish chapter [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1731.7199999999998s)]
*  but depending on whether he's he's alive or dead that really [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1734.12s)]
*  brings the tone of the of the next chapter of whether we are [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1739.1599999999999s)]
*  Burying our beloved. Uh ellie or whether we are trying to help him to rehabilitate from a horrific, uh [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1742.9199999999998s)]

*  Whether it's possible to rehabilitate from from that but that that will be part of my focus going forward not just myself but [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1758.92s)]
*  To help him recover and and to build a life if that's possible [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1765.96s)]
*  Stephen i'm grateful for your time and and for [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1772.84s)]
*  Really just giving us a a look and perhaps a way to begin to understand what it's been like for for hostage families [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1775.8s)]
*  Thank you for being with us here on bbc news as we've been reporting [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1781.96s)]
*  It looks like the first the first hostage release israeli hostage release of the ceasefire agreement [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1787.08s)]
*  Is entrained just now these pictures that you're seeing from raym in southern israel [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1793.0s)]
*  Are the pictures of the helicopters in the sky the pictures are seeing of the trucks on the ground [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1797.16s)]
*  This is the israeli military waiting to receive the hostages after they've been brought through gaza [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1802.3600000000001s)]
*  They are handed across to the military. They are put very much into the hands of [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1808.12s)]
*  specialists who are used to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1812.5s)]
*  Just trying to support people in what will be a very difficult transitional situation. They will be [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  Psychologically trying to find out how they are what they've been through [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  Physically, they will be checking how they are what kind of medical treatment they need. They will then be taken to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1827.3799999999999s)]
*  hospitals here in israel, we believe [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  shiba [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1835.6999999999998s)]
*  Hospital not far from where I am here in tel aviv is waiting to receive those three hostages [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1836.98s)]
*  So as we see those live pictures of what is happening in southern israel [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1841.8600000000001s)]
*  We also see pictures from the occupied west bank and from offer prison there, which is where around 90 [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1846.1s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners will be released as part of this deal each time. There is a release of israeli hostages [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  There is also a recent release of palestinian prisoners who are being held in israeli jails [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1859.7s)]
*  And it happens to a specific [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1865.1399999999999s)]
*  A specific ratio as well what you're seeing now actually if you see here you see somebody being [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1867.78s)]
*  Arrested in these live pictures outside offer prison. There are many many family members who are waiting there [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1872.02s)]
*  For their loved ones to be released. They've actually been told by israel [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1878.74s)]
*  They are trying to to avoid [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1884.26s)]
*  Tensions and difficulties in that area. They were asked not to celebrate publicly [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1887.22s)]
*  Um, so as you can see it looks it is always a difficult [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1891.46s)]
*  Situation to manage at a moment like this, you know, you have people who who are very very close now to seeing [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1896.6599999999999s)]
*  Their loved ones release that 90 prisoner number we believe is mainly women today [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1903.3s)]
*  um [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1909.1399999999999s)]
*  Around about 70 or so women a number of teenagers and just 10 or so of that number are men [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1910.1s)]
*  Who've been held for various different reasons [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1917.78s)]
*  Um that ratio, you know [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1920.18s)]
*  We're seeing sort of 30 [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1922.42s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners today released for every one israeli hostage [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1924.48s)]
*  So these are two key parts of the deal. I can certainly tell you that this morning at 8 30 [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1928.66s)]
*  Here people were they were concerned [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1933.54s)]
*  Both palestinians and israelis were concerned that these scenes that you're seeing now these live pictures that you're seeing now [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1936.8999999999999s)]
*  Might not come to pass [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1943.06s)]
*  They were concerned that when the ceasefire was delayed all the way until 11 30 [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1944.74s)]
*  That this deal might be knocked irrevocably off track. There was a real concern from people here that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1950.42s)]
*  They would have you know, a lot of difficulty in actually [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1958.1s)]
*  In actually sort of bringing it back together. It is an enormously [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1964.66s)]
*  Complicated and difficult deal. There are lots of ways [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1968.72s)]
*  In which it can come apart this morning was an example of that [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1972.4199999999998s)]
*  But it has a long way to go. This first phase [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1976.8999999999999s)]
*  Is six weeks long 42 days long [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1980.4199999999998s)]
*  And there will be these releases and exchanges [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1984.1799999999998s)]
*  essentially [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1987.52s)]
*  one of those a week [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1988.74s)]
*  With small groups of israeli hostages and then larger groups of palestinian prisoners who are swapped as part of this deal [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1990.58s)]
*  If that's going well after 16 days [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1997.06s)]
*  Then talks begin about what happens next after that they begin about the second phase and the third phase which will be [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=1999.8600000000001s)]
*  the eventual [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2007.5400000000002s)]
*  reconstruction of gaza, but again some of those things haven't even been [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2009.44s)]
*  You know, they haven't even been discussed yet [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2014.42s)]
*  There are things that that are on the table where they haven't even begun to decide how that will work and how that will happen [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2016.2600000000002s)]
*  um, so it is something that uh [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2023.22s)]
*  Uh, and we heard from stephen brisley there didn't we that um [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2025.7s)]
*  That it is just particularly difficult, you know, if your loved one is is further down that process further on in the group [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2031.46s)]
*  um [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2037.54s)]
*  You know it is um [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2038.58s)]
*  There is a lot of waiting and a lot of a lot of watching and a lot of hoping [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2040.3400000000001s)]
*  That this deal will hold for long enough to actually uh to actually bring things in place [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2044.82s)]
*  Um now there's a lot of people who've been moving around we've been hearing from uh from hostage families [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2050.42s)]
*  Uh here in tel aviv here in hostages square and i'd like to just bring in [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2056.1s)]
*  Thank you. Ema. God pollack is with me now. We know that one of the people who is being released today is emily damari [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2061.22s)]
*  Uh the british israeli dual national and you have been very involved throughout the process with her mum mandel [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2067.54s)]
*  Well certainly in the last few months and mandy [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2074.74s)]
*  Who wasn't born to do any of this to sit with presidents and prime ministers and so on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2077.54s)]
*  She's done remarkable as I guess everyone would do for their children [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2082.2599999999998s)]
*  And she has done a remarkable job [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2086.5s)]
*  I guess until she has her in her arms, which we hope will be anytime looking over there [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2089.62s)]
*  um [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2095.06s)]
*  great special moment [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2095.94s)]
*  What kind of support has she? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2098.1s)]
*  She needed because as you say there's just there's emotional support there's there's political support. There's all those things that you don't really [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2101.06s)]
*  People who've volunteered to help but you know, I chaired a press conference for her in london after she'd done her meetings with her prime minister [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2111.78s)]
*  And the foreign secretary and kenny badenoff and everybody [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2120.1s)]
*  And I chaired it for her to give her support [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2124.98s)]
*  She did me [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2128.5s)]
*  She was remarkable very straightforward [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2130.02s)]
*  Uh talking about her daughter. There's a great little moment [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2132.98s)]
*  And I learned about actually today while i've been here that on her left arm emily's got mom mom [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2136.7400000000002s)]
*  Mom's always right [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2142.82s)]
*  And that's on her arm. So I wonder if that's just a bit of comfort over those horrible months [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2144.42s)]
*  Mom is always right. I think any mom any mom anywhere would agree with that sentiment [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2150.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely my late mom would agree too [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2155.06s)]
*  And tell us a bit more about what you've learned about about emily as a person because one thing i've always been very struck by [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2157.94s)]
*  Is when you're here in in hostages square or even around tala veed wherever you are in the country [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2163.8599999999997s)]
*  You see these faces you always see the same pictures the same faces the names become very familiar [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2168.1s)]
*  So tell us more about emily's story. Well, I don't know too much about I mean [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2173.8599999999997s)]
*  I know mandy the mom and I came in because I didn't I will hopefully have the opportunity to meet [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2177.7799999999997s)]
*  Emily who seems like a [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2182.58s)]
*  28 year old who is enjoying enjoying life [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2185.12s)]
*  Here, so I can't give you that that about her and we'll look forward but if she's anything like a mom [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2189.3799999999997s)]
*  She's going to be a great girl [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2196.58s)]
*  That will be really special actually to for you to meet somebody [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2198.3399999999997s)]
*  Who you've heard about and you've talked about and all these efforts have been made for [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2202.02s)]
*  You know the moment that that you actually eventually sort of get to to meet her. I imagine that'll be a [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2206.5s)]
*  Quite special one for you. I mean when you try to work and try to help and you [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2211.78s)]
*  The news over the last year and however [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2217.54s)]
*  It's been difficult and so many [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2220.6600000000003s)]
*  Are dead so many are not with us and everyone you think the worst [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2222.6600000000003s)]
*  And then you come to something like today. So yes, of course i've hopefully with that after all the treatment and that she's guest back [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2226.6600000000003s)]
*  I look forward to inviting her to the house of lords [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2233.54s)]
*  Look like it's good to talk to you. Thank you so much for making some time for us. Thank you [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2236.42s)]
*  Look like as we've been hearing emily damari 28 years older a dual israeli british citizen [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2240.6600000000003s)]
*  And we now know one of those three women who is being released at the moment [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2246.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, we're keeping on these live pictures showing you the the live pictures as they're happening [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2250.98s)]
*  Um, and they're here on the screen in hostages square as well [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2256.02s)]
*  They very often will sort of broadcast israeli tv here and you'll find people just standing [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2260.02s)]
*  Watching the screen finding out the latest watching and waiting to see what's uh, what's going on [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2265.54s)]
*  But it certainly looks they're looking at pictures [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2271.54s)]
*  From inside gaza at the moment. Uh, we've seen pictures on that screen of trucks from the red cross [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2274.9s)]
*  Um, and we're also seeing helicopters at rame in southern israel as well [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2281.7799999999997s)]
*  So everything at this point seems to be moving moving smoothly particularly after that that don't forget that delay [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2286.58s)]
*  That we had this morning that difficult delay when israel said that it would not move forward with the ceasefire until [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2292.82s)]
*  Hamas did what it should have done at 4 pm yesterday and actually confirmed the names of the three women who are being released today [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2299.5400000000004s)]
*  And this is just what some people in jerusalem here in israel had to say about that delay and about that ceasefire agreement [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2306.5s)]
*  The hostages have to come back it's a very very difficult deal [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2322.7400000000002s)]
*  Lots of terrorists are being released and it's terrible, but we have no option [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2327.38s)]
*  And another thing is that the it's not such a great deal [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2331.38s)]
*  For us either i'm just praying that most of the hostages come home alive. Peace god and that this suffering ends for them [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2334.7400000000002s)]
*  we release [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2342.42s)]
*  Killers, they will come back to kill. We know it for sure and we are [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2343.86s)]
*  It's it's very hard what we are doing and it's very hard we're dealing with the terrorists [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2349.06s)]
*  They're cheating us [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2354.3399999999997s)]
*  Every time again and again and we feel very very heavy. It's like a heavy feeling. I can't do nothing [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2356.02s)]
*  i'm always thinking about the terrorists that going back to [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2362.58s)]
*  To jerusalem the way the way the way I see it [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2366.8199999999997s)]
*  it's between [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2370.74s)]
*  That that deal to the worst deal [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2373.3799999999997s)]
*  So unfortunately, we're going to do that but [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2375.54s)]
*  It's very very hard people don't [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2380.02s)]
*  Nobody is really happy about what's going to happen. We're happy to release the hostages. We're really happy to have them home [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2382.74s)]
*  but [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2390.82s)]
*  We know what the cost is going to be [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2391.7799999999997s)]
*  It's the views of people in jerusalem a little earlier today and a lot has been said about [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2396.18s)]
*  The very intense and very delicate diplomacy that has been needed to actually get this agreement in place between [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2401.62s)]
*  Israel and hamas who you know, they don't talk directly. They don't have direct relations. It all happens through [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2408.4199999999996s)]
*  mediators from qatar and from egypt the u.s [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2414.72s)]
*  Has played a big part as well. But of course what happens here has an impact around the wider [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2417.8599999999997s)]
*  Middle east region and of course it reverberates around the world as well and a little earlier [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2423.7799999999997s)]
*  My colleague lise ducette our chief international correspondent spoke to sigrid khan who is the un's special coordinator [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2428.58s)]
*  For the middle east peace process [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2435.62s)]
*  I think it's a very fluid and fragile situation. We also know that people have been more than desperate for so many months [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2437.7799999999997s)]
*  Chaos has to be factored in but we have tried with qatar with the u.s with egypt and in [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2445.54s)]
*  A very effective cooperation with the israelis to try to find ways in which to channel that there are agreements with the civilian police [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2452.02s)]
*  So we are hopeful that the risk of chaos can be as mitigated as possible [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2459.7s)]
*  But one should expect joy [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2465.94s)]
*  Despair people out in the streets. It will not be easy, but we have prepared to the extent this is humanly possible [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2468.64s)]
*  You mentioned the civilian police they are the police of hamas they'll be used they'll be wearing the blue uniforms [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2476.04s)]
*  Hamas, of course has been significantly weakened during these 15 months of war [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2482.12s)]
*  Do they really? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2487.96s)]
*  Have the ability and the will to take on what you know because you've been dealing with it in your work the criminal gangs [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2489.4s)]
*  Who have been who've been attacking the eight convoys as they enter gaza a sign of the desperation there [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2495.88s)]
*  Well, um the proof of the pudding here lies in the eating [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2501.8s)]
*  I think there's another factor not to be underestimated the civilians themselves [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2506.28s)]
*  They know aid is coming for them. They have endured criminal activity [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2510.76s)]
*  They have also been a victim of the looting that's taken place. It has deprived them [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2515.8s)]
*  Of this critical essential assistance that was being sent even though it was too low in volume and too little [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2521.1600000000003s)]
*  Over time, I think the balancing act lies in the constant flow in the implementation [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2527.88s)]
*  And as I said, I can't exclude a form of chaos erupting [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2533.48s)]
*  I also can't predict right now that all will be well with the civilian police [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2537.48s)]
*  But we are hopeful that the security arrangements that are put in place and with the assistance on the egyptian side [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2541.48s)]
*  That we can help manage this and mitigate this [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2549.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the importance of the security arrangements is that we can help them to be able to do what they want [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2552.04s)]
*  And I think this is also the effective implementation of this deal also when it comes to the volume that has now been agreed to [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2557.88s)]
*  Both to the south and the north of gaza food all kinds of other items and fuel so the facilities could be running [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2565.08s)]
*  It's a complex operation one of the most complex I would venture at in this day and age under these conditions [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2572.84s)]
*  So 600 trucks as you know, we've heard time and again this word flow [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2579.58s)]
*  That eight hundreds of trucks will flow into gaza and they never did the numbers as you know have been far far short of what is needed [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2584.54s)]
*  Is it are you convinced that the the logistics are in place in terms of the un being able to deliver the aid? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2590.54s)]
*  The israelis allowing and not holding them up by strenuous inspections [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2596.54s)]
*  Are you sure that there's a way to do that? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2600.54s)]
*  Well we've made we've gone through we've dotted the t we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's in recent days [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2603.5s)]
*  My colleagues technical teams have been in Cairo precisely for that purpose speaking with the israelis [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2609.5s)]
*  The qataris egyptians and the u.s. There's a fairly detailed agreement in place [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2615.5s)]
*  We know that a certain number of people have been in the area of the [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2621.5s)]
*  We know that assistance will come from israel west bank the very effective jordan routes that has been working [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2629.0s)]
*  Trucks are entering as we speak from egypt via kerem abu salim kerem shalom [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2635.0s)]
*  And aid will continue to flow from ashdod. Am i sure with a certainty 100 things can happen [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2641.0s)]
*  But these are the arrangements and as my qatari colleague described [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2647.0s)]
*  There are operational crisis cells and rooms in place to troubleshoot if and when something risks derailing [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2653.96s)]
*  The flow is important the continuity and of course ultimately as we've often said the distribution to people inside gaza [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2661.96s)]
*  Nothing matters if it doesn't reach me [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2669.96s)]
*  As you know the israelis when they've been challenged about the distribution of aid [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2673.96s)]
*  They've always said that hundreds of trucks are there ready to move but the united nations didn't have the capability to deliver the food [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2680.92s)]
*  As part of this process have you been able to send in more people into gaza to help [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2686.92s)]
*  Have been able to strengthen your own logistics your own your own chain supply chain to ensure that the performance will be better [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2692.92s)]
*  Well this is one of the areas that we're seeing a lot of people in the area of the israeli [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2700.92s)]
*  Well this is one of the areas we continue to work on to scale up [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2707.88s)]
*  But don't forget that most of our staff in gaza are palestinian civilians who are there working [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2711.88s)]
*  A lot of palestinian NGOs and ultimately my own colleagues [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2717.88s)]
*  This aid delivery doesn't depend solely on the UN we are a big motor including of course umrah the backbone of most of these operations [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2721.88s)]
*  But there are also bilateral support mechanisms in place now as well as an important role that the NGOs will play [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2732.84s)]
*  It's a combined effort what it does show however with this agreement in place and with the early hours of it being implemented [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2738.84s)]
*  It shows the power and difference political will makes [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2746.84s)]
*  Systems can be there if there's not the political will to execute decisions taking everything else fails [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2752.84s)]
*  There is the political will we need to make sure that the pressure is sustained and international commitments also to finance [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2759.8s)]
*  And to help accelerate the assistance are there and remain in place gaza is not saved overnight [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2765.8s)]
*  I will speak to uh Lis de Set very soon as well [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2777.8s)]
*  As we continue to bring you really some of the context and analysis behind what we're seeing here [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2782.76s)]
*  Today the ceasefire in gaza which is finally finally coming to force at around quarter past 11 this morning local time [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2788.76s)]
*  But there is a I think a real hope and a will that that will that will continue and that the full process will not be derailed [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2796.76s)]
*  And will actually continue to its conclusion [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2804.76s)]
*  We're seeing some live pictures now from the occupied west bank this is of a prison [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2809.7200000000003s)]
*  It is where many Palestinian prisoners are held it is an Israeli prison [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  You can see the red cross are outside there's a truck there's also a bus as well [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2817.7200000000003s)]
*  Again this will probably mirror what we saw during the last brief ceasefire over a year ago now [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2823.7200000000003s)]
*  Where those Palestinian prisoners who were released were taken actually on a bus [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2829.7200000000003s)]
*  And taken back and given back to their families [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2836.68s)]
*  One thing that Israel have been trying to prevent is people gathering in large numbers around the prison [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2840.68s)]
*  They say they don't want a security risk they say sort of around a higher security prison [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2848.68s)]
*  So what we'll expect to see I think is those prisoners actually being loaded onto buses [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2854.68s)]
*  And taken to be reunited with their loved ones [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2860.68s)]
*  We're seeing a live video from our correspondent John Donison who is in that area [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2865.64s)]
*  He's been in Ramallah today really talking about the anticipation of those Palestinian families [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2869.64s)]
*  Many of whom who have not seen their loved ones for some considerable period of time now [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2875.64s)]
*  And are looking forward to being reunited with them [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2881.64s)]
*  Around 90 Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails today [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2885.64s)]
*  The majority of them women we're told [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2890.6s)]
*  A small number of teenagers and around 10 or so of them are men [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2892.6s)]
*  So those are live pictures that we've been looking at from outside of a prison [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2898.6s)]
*  These are all different locations absolutely key to this ceasefire agreement [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2904.6s)]
*  That we will be continuing to show you [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2908.6s)]
*  I just want to show you Rayim as well in southern Israel [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2912.6s)]
*  Now we had helicopters in the air before [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2917.56s)]
*  It looks like the helicopters on the ground now [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2919.56s)]
*  This is where the military are expecting the Israeli hostages to be brought to [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2923.56s)]
*  Again by the Red Cross they are very instrumental in these handover moments [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2929.56s)]
*  So those hostages will be taken [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2935.56s)]
*  And we believe from Rayim from that military base they will be flown to Sheba Hospital in Israel [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2938.56s)]
*  In fact I can show you what is happening there as well [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2945.52s)]
*  This is where the three female hostages will be received [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2947.52s)]
*  Will be physically checked over [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2953.52s)]
*  Will be given some mental health support [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2955.52s)]
*  But also will be reunited with their families [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2958.52s)]
*  In what is a moment filled with nerves [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2962.52s)]
*  I think until when you speak to hostage families [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2966.52s)]
*  They say until they're actually back together with their loved ones [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2969.52s)]
*  They still believe it could slip away right until the very last moment [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2974.48s)]
*  The delays this morning were enormously difficult [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2977.48s)]
*  We've heard from people here on BBC News today [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2979.48s)]
*  Who were really struggling with that idea of the delay [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2982.48s)]
*  The idea that things might all fall down at the last minute [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2986.48s)]
*  So that hospital will be absolutely crucial [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2990.48s)]
*  As part of this story today [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2994.48s)]
*  One of the key elements of phase one of that deal [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2996.48s)]
*  And our correspondent Jonah Fisher is there [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=2998.48s)]
*  Jonah I know these things are very carefully managed [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3002.44s)]
*  The flow of information is very carefully managed [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3005.44s)]
*  Do we know anything yet about the preparations that are being made there [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3007.44s)]
*  To receive these women? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3011.44s)]
*  Well yeah you might be able to see behind me [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3016.44s)]
*  That there are barriers that have been put up [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3018.44s)]
*  We've been waiting all day really for further news to come through [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3020.44s)]
*  Of exactly when these three female hostages would make it here [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3024.44s)]
*  We've been waiting for them to come to the airport [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3030.4s)]
*  Just a couple of minutes walk that way [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3033.4s)]
*  Where we're expecting them to be brought with [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3036.4s)]
*  Just to talk you through the chronology of how this is supposed to work [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3039.4s)]
*  The Red Cross is currently in Gaza [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3042.4s)]
*  Attempting to pick these three female hostages up from Hamas [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3045.4s)]
*  They will then take them [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3050.4s)]
*  And hand them over to the Israeli forces [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3052.4s)]
*  The IDF inside Gaza [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3055.4s)]
*  We believe to Reim, which is just across the border [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3058.36s)]
*  In the central part of Gaza [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3061.36s)]
*  And we believe at that point it's possible [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3063.36s)]
*  That they may be reunited with some family members [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3065.36s)]
*  They are then likely to be put on a helicopter at that point [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3068.36s)]
*  And flown here to Sheba Medical Center [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3072.36s)]
*  Which is one of the biggest hospitals in the Middle East [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3075.36s)]
*  We are expecting them to be brought here [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3079.36s)]
*  And indeed for some of them to need medical treatment [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3081.36s)]
*  We have been hearing reports for when these three women were captured [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3085.32s)]
*  At least two of them had injuries [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3088.32s)]
*  As Hamas captured them on the 7th of October 2023 [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3091.32s)]
*  So it is likely that there will need to be some medical attention [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3094.32s)]
*  Jonah, as you've been sort of saying there [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3105.32s)]
*  We know that these three women are being released today [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3108.32s)]
*  In the first 42 days, the first six weeks of this process [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3112.28s)]
*  33 hostages will be released in varying states of health [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3115.28s)]
*  The official Israeli line is that they believe [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3120.28s)]
*  That most of those 33 are alive [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3123.28s)]
*  We don't know how that translates in numbers [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3126.28s)]
*  But there will be people who will still be in [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3129.28s)]
*  I would imagine remarkably decent condition [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3132.28s)]
*  Given their ordeal [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3134.28s)]
*  And there will be people who will need a larger amount of medical help [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3135.28s)]
*  I think people are preparing themselves for the fact [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3139.2400000000002s)]
*  That after 15 months in captivity in Gaza [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3142.2400000000002s)]
*  Probably being kept underground for long periods by Hamas [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3147.2400000000002s)]
*  Who knows how they have been treated during that period [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  Those of the 33 who have had medical issues [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3156.2400000000002s)]
*  They will be in bad need of some assistance [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  I think we should be very clear that it is a list of 33 [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3167.2s)]
*  But some of those on the list have in the past been reported [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3171.2s)]
*  As having been killed and as having died in captivity [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3175.2s)]
*  So I think the reality of it is going to be that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3179.2s)]
*  The 33 who come back [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3182.2s)]
*  Some will be in need of medical attention immediately [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3183.2s)]
*  Some may, on the surface at least, be okay [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3186.2s)]
*  But there will also be the very sad sight [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3190.2s)]
*  I imagine on some occasions what Israel gets back [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3194.16s)]
*  Is the bodies of hostages who died while they were being held in Gaza [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3197.16s)]
*  Jonah, thank you for being with us [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3205.16s)]
*  Our correspondent there at Sheba Hospital [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3207.16s)]
*  Watching and waiting for the arrival of those Israeli hostages there [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3212.16s)]
*  And all of these various live pictures [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3217.16s)]
*  That you see in the media right now [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3221.12s)]
*  Mainly the scene in Israel at the moment [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3224.12s)]
*  That is where the movement is happening [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3227.12s)]
*  That is where the preparations are happening [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3230.12s)]
*  Although people here in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3232.12s)]
*  Have been watching various pictures on the big screen [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3235.12s)]
*  Being shown on Israeli TV [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3238.12s)]
*  They have been watching pictures from inside Gaza [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3241.12s)]
*  They have been watching pictures of what looked like [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3245.12s)]
*  Some sort of handover [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3248.12s)]
*  Which again mirrors what we saw [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3251.08s)]
*  When we had the hostage release at the time [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3254.08s)]
*  Of the last ceasefire as well [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3257.08s)]
*  So when we look at the times, it is 5 to 5 now [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3260.08s)]
*  Just coming up to 5 to 5 in Israel and in Gaza [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3263.08s)]
*  Very much the time that the hostage release should be in train [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3266.08s)]
*  And those pictures that we have been seeing [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3271.08s)]
*  Very much reflect that [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3274.08s)]
*  And so what we will expect to happen [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3278.04s)]
*  Is confirmation when it occurs [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3281.04s)]
*  That those hostages have been handed over [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3284.04s)]
*  And when they are considered to be safely back in Israeli hands [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3287.04s)]
*  That is when the next phase of this is triggered [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3290.04s)]
*  If you like, the next phase comes into action [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3293.04s)]
*  And that is the release of Palestinian prisoners [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3296.04s)]
*  In Israeli jails, particularly in Ofo prison [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3299.04s)]
*  Where again we have been showing you those live pictures [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3302.04s)]
*  In the occupied West Bank [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3306.0s)]
*  As the Red Cross wait to receive those prisoners [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3309.0s)]
*  They will almost certainly be put on those Red Cross buses [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3315.0s)]
*  And then taken and actually returned [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3318.0s)]
*  To their loved ones as well [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3321.0s)]
*  So a lot of different things happening at the moment [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3324.0s)]
*  It has been at times a very fast moving day [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3327.0s)]
*  But at times things have moved very slowly as well [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3330.0s)]
*  But it just shows you the complexity of this agreement [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3333.96s)]
*  Which it took, let's not forget, months and months [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3336.96s)]
*  To actually get to a position [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3339.96s)]
*  Where this deal could be agreed on [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3342.96s)]
*  The outgoing US President Joe Biden [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3345.96s)]
*  Said that this was pretty much the framework of the deal [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3348.96s)]
*  That he put forward in May of last year [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3351.96s)]
*  And it is only actually going [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3354.96s)]
*  Coming to fruition [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3357.96s)]
*  Actually happening in January [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3361.92s)]
*  Almost a year later [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3364.92s)]
*  Where so much has been talked about [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3367.92s)]
*  So much has been worked on [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3370.92s)]
*  So much fine detail has gone back and forth [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3373.92s)]
*  Before Israel and Hamas got to a position [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3376.92s)]
*  That they both felt they could accept and agree to [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3379.92s)]
*  We can talk to our Chief International Correspondent [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3382.92s)]
*  Lise Doucet once again [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3385.92s)]
*  We're going to look at these live pictures of Opa Prison [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3389.88s)]
*  Where the Palestinian prisoner release [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3392.88s)]
*  Is due to be happening very soon [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3395.88s)]
*  But as we were talking about there [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3398.88s)]
*  It's a multi-layered agreement, isn't it? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3401.88s)]
*  There's the hostages, the prisoner release [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3404.88s)]
*  There's Palestinians able to move back towards their homes [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3407.88s)]
*  Or what is left of them in Gaza [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3410.88s)]
*  Extra aid as well [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3413.88s)]
*  The poignant scenes that we're seeing today [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3417.84s)]
*  The people waiting in Hostage Square [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3420.84s)]
*  That's become known as Hostages Square [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3423.84s)]
*  In Tel Aviv [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3426.84s)]
*  The interviews with the families of Palestinian prisoners [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3429.84s)]
*  The families of Israeli hostages [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3432.84s)]
*  It's a reminder if one was needed [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3435.84s)]
*  In the midst of all of this politics [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3438.84s)]
*  All of the security concerns [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3441.84s)]
*  It's a very, very human process [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3445.8s)]
*  And today you feel that roller coaster [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3448.8s)]
*  Of emotion [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3451.8s)]
*  Just listening to some of the Israelis speaking [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3454.8s)]
*  You feel that a nation is holding its breath [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3457.8s)]
*  Waiting to see the first glimpses [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3460.8s)]
*  Although we're not sure exactly when we will see the first images [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3463.8s)]
*  Because it will be an intensely personal moment [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3466.8s)]
*  An intensely emotional moment [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3469.8s)]
*  We understand on their way out of the Gaza Strip [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3473.76s)]
*  And we expect the Israeli government will announce [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3476.76s)]
*  When they put their feet firmly and freely on Israeli [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3479.76s)]
*  So that Israel can say [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3482.76s)]
*  They are now free [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3485.76s)]
*  So many watching everyone the same [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3488.76s)]
*  With the scenes outside the Palestinian prisons [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3491.76s)]
*  Where more than 90 Palestinians will be released [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3494.76s)]
*  Many of them have been there for many, many months [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3497.76s)]
*  Many years and many of them never been charged [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3501.7200000000003s)]
*  Under the administrative detention rules of Israel [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3504.7200000000003s)]
*  This part of a very complex [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3507.7200000000003s)]
*  Complex process [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  This phase [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3513.7200000000003s)]
*  Is called the humanitarian phase [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3516.7200000000003s)]
*  Because it is very much the emphasis [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3519.7200000000003s)]
*  On this exchange of hostages and prisoners [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3522.7200000000003s)]
*  And even though there's much criticism [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3525.7200000000003s)]
*  Of the way that the hostages are being threatened in this way [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3529.68s)]
*  Such as the nature of this really merciless war [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3532.68s)]
*  In the Middle East [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3535.68s)]
*  And as we're speaking [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3538.68s)]
*  We see that the white vehicles [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3541.68s)]
*  With their distinctive branding of the International Committee [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3544.68s)]
*  Of the Red Cross [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3547.68s)]
*  They're now going into Ofer prison [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3550.68s)]
*  Where they will be there to pick up the hostages [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3553.68s)]
*  So really many aspects of these wars are the keeper [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3556.68s)]
*  Of the Geneva Conventions, the rules on war [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3559.68s)]
*  They're playing a role when it comes to the Palestinian prisoners [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3562.68s)]
*  They're playing a role when it comes to the Israeli hostages [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3565.68s)]
*  Although it was often said and with great bitterness and anger [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3568.68s)]
*  Among the Israelis that the International Committee [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3571.68s)]
*  Of the Red Cross was never able to see the hostages [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3574.68s)]
*  They don't get a lot of the access they would like to get [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3577.68s)]
*  They do get access to some of the Israeli prisons [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3580.68s)]
*  But they're always asking for more to be allowed to play their role [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3583.68s)]
*  But they're always asking for more to be allowed to play their role [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3586.68s)]
*  So the process is unfolding after the delay of a few hours [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3589.68s)]
*  So the process is unfolding after the delay of a few hours [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3592.68s)]
*  This morning, let's just get up an update again [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3595.68s)]
*  We've been hearing throughout the day from our correspondent Jonah Fisher [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3598.68s)]
*  He's at the Sheba Hospital, that is where the first of the hostages [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3601.68s)]
*  The first three women, Doreen, Romy and Emily [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3604.68s)]
*  Will arrive, Jonah, but not surprisingly [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3607.68s)]
*  The media is being kept away so there won't be any cameras [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3610.68s)]
*  As the hostages go in for those [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3613.68s)]
*  Really would have to be a very complete medical check [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3616.68s)]
*  One doctor speaking to the BBC World Service today [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3619.68s)]
*  Spoke about a total body effect mentally, physically [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3622.68s)]
*  There's just no information about what kind of condition [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3625.68s)]
*  They will be when they arrive at that hospital just behind you [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3628.68s)]
*  They will be when they arrive at that hospital just behind you [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3631.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Liz, we've been [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3634.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Liz, we've been [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3637.68s)]
*  Trying to follow the process of this [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3640.68s)]
*  Handover of Israeli hostages [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3643.68s)]
*  Throughout the course of today [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3646.68s)]
*  The latest we're hearing is that they haven't yet been given [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3649.68s)]
*  To the Red Cross, that's the latest from the Israeli side [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3652.68s)]
*  Here we know that the Red Cross delegation has gone to try [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3655.68s)]
*  And pick them up in Gaza [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3658.68s)]
*  At the same time we're seeing images come through [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3661.68s)]
*  From Gaza itself, it's not clear if it's where the pick-up, the [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3664.68s)]
*  Handover is due to take place [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3667.68s)]
*  Of large crowds gathering and of masked Hamas fighters [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3670.68s)]
*  Of large crowds gathering and of masked Hamas fighters [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3673.68s)]
*  Holding the crowds back [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3676.68s)]
*  So we are really waiting for confirmation from the Israeli side [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3679.68s)]
*  That they have, that the hostages have crossed [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3682.68s)]
*  Out of Gaza into Israel itself [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3685.68s)]
*  And that the Red Cross have delivered them to them [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3688.68s)]
*  We are then expecting them to go to Reim [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3691.68s)]
*  Which is a settlement just across the border into Israel [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3694.68s)]
*  Quite possibly at that moment it will be then [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3697.68s)]
*  That some of them get reunited with their families [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3700.68s)]
*  And then we are expecting them to be brought here [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3703.68s)]
*  I'm at the Sheba Medical Center [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3706.68s)]
*  Just outside Tel Aviv, it's one of the biggest hospitals [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3709.68s)]
*  In the Middle East, we are expecting them to be brought here [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3712.68s)]
*  By helicopter and then to be driven in [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3715.68s)]
*  You might have to see behind me they put up tarpaulins [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3718.68s)]
*  And barriers because for very understandable reasons [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3721.68s)]
*  As you were saying, this is not going to be a public event [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3724.68s)]
*  Two of the three women who are hopefully in the process [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3727.68s)]
*  Of being released right now [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3730.68s)]
*  We believe sustained injuries when they were captured [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3733.68s)]
*  On the 7th of October 2023 [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3736.68s)]
*  So they obviously are likely to have issues [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3739.68s)]
*  Which need to be addressed [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3742.68s)]
*  And then that's not factoring in the impact of 15 months [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3745.68s)]
*  In captivity in Gaza being held by Hamas [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3748.68s)]
*  Quite possibly underground for long periods [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3751.68s)]
*  We do not know how they have been treated [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3754.68s)]
*  Quite possibly very badly [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3757.68s)]
*  So I think it's very likely when they come here [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3760.68s)]
*  They will be kept very much away from the glare [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3763.68s)]
*  Of the media spotlight [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3766.68s)]
*  We are probably likely to see some images [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3769.68s)]
*  Which the Israeli authorities choose to make public [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3772.68s)]
*  And to release to show people [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3775.68s)]
*  That they are indeed home [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3778.68s)]
*  But for very understandable reasons [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3781.68s)]
*  We are not expecting to see any of them in the flesh [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3784.68s)]
*  Yes, many of our viewers may remember [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3787.68s)]
*  It's hard to forget them [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3790.68s)]
*  The emotional scenes in the hospital [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3793.68s)]
*  Where there was the reuniting of families and children [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3796.68s)]
*  And really heartwarming scenes [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3799.68s)]
*  When hostages emerged alive [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3802.68s)]
*  And were again in the embrace of their family members [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3805.68s)]
*  Earlier today, Jonah, there was a report [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3808.68s)]
*  That Israel said that they had learned lessons [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3811.68s)]
*  They put it, from the hostage releases [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3814.68s)]
*  About 100 hostages in November of 2023 [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3817.68s)]
*  When there were very controversial videos [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3820.68s)]
*  Put out by Hamas [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3823.68s)]
*  They were handing over the hostages [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3826.68s)]
*  Many of them elderly women [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3829.68s)]
*  To the International Committee of the Red Cross [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3832.68s)]
*  And some of the women didn't want to have anything to do with them [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3835.68s)]
*  One left her hand and said shalom [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3838.68s)]
*  It was seen as a rather, really a human gesture [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3841.68s)]
*  After a terrible captivity [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3844.68s)]
*  But we understand the Israelis are going to try to ensure [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3847.68s)]
*  That those kind of videos don't emerge again [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3850.68s)]
*  Because the strip isn't in their hands [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3853.68s)]
*  And it would also be the desire of the International Committee of the Red Cross [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3856.68s)]
*  Who always tried to preserve the dignity [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3859.68s)]
*  Of people who are caught up in these terrible circumstances [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3862.68s)]
*  To ensure that nothing is done [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3865.68s)]
*  To cause further stress to them [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3868.68s)]
*  In these incredibly stressful moments [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3871.68s)]
*  So everyone will be keeping a very close eye [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3874.68s)]
*  On the whole choreography of this [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3877.68s)]
*  The objective has to be the wellbeing [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3880.68s)]
*  Of those first three women [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3883.68s)]
*  Who will be emerging [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3886.68s)]
*  And we understand as you've been saying Jonah [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3889.68s)]
*  They'll soon be back in Israel and of course the Palestinian prisoners [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3892.68s)]
*  Who also come out of Israeli detention [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3895.68s)]
*  And last time there were those videos too [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3898.68s)]
*  And their reports of ill treatment inside Israeli prisons [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3901.68s)]
*  But Jonah you should get an idea there soon [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3904.68s)]
*  And I think that's what's going to unfold in the next hour or so [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3907.68s)]
*  Yeah exactly [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3910.68s)]
*  We are waiting here really to see what goes on [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3913.68s)]
*  I think the next step will be confirmation from the Red Cross [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3916.68s)]
*  Perhaps that they have the three hostages in their possession [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3919.68s)]
*  And then we will hear most likely from the Israelis [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3922.68s)]
*  Once they have crossed the border [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3925.68s)]
*  That will be the true moment in which I think [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3928.68s)]
*  Israel will say that they have been released [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3931.68s)]
*  I think that's probably at that point that may lead on [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3934.68s)]
*  As you were saying to the release of the Palestinian prisoners [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3937.68s)]
*  The way this deal is going to work [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3940.68s)]
*  It's a pretty well phased agreement [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3943.68s)]
*  Is that every few days some Israeli hostages will be released [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3946.68s)]
*  There are 33 names [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3949.68s)]
*  Which have been released to be part of this six week [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3952.68s)]
*  Temporary ceasefire as it's being called [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3955.68s)]
*  Particularly here in Israel [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3958.68s)]
*  And it's expected that every time that the Hamas [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3961.68s)]
*  Sets free a group of Israeli hostages [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3964.68s)]
*  Or indeed hands over the remains [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3967.68s)]
*  Of an Israeli hostage [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3970.68s)]
*  Because we don't know and we're not expecting [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3973.68s)]
*  All of those 33 hostages to be alive still [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3976.68s)]
*  Every time that happens we're expecting there to be a reciprocal [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3979.68s)]
*  Release of Palestinian prisoners [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3982.68s)]
*  So today there's a list of 90 Palestinian prisoners [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3985.68s)]
*  That has been prepared for release [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3988.68s)]
*  Some of those who are lined up to be released from the Palestinian side [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3991.68s)]
*  Have been in jail for pretty horrific offences [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3994.68s)]
*  Murdering Israelis, some involved in bomb attacks [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=3997.68s)]
*  That have killed multiple Israelis [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4000.68s)]
*  So it's not going to be a particularly palatable moment [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4003.68s)]
*  For the Israeli public when they see the scenes of celebrations [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4006.68s)]
*  When they see some of these people who have been involved in attacks [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4009.68s)]
*  On Israel and Israelis going free [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4012.68s)]
*  In return for the release of these hostages [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4015.68s)]
*  Yes, as you know, very, very controversial [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4018.68s)]
*  In Israel there's been criticism expressed by many Israelis [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4021.68s)]
*  We heard it earlier today from the Israeli Foreign Minister [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4024.68s)]
*  Gideon Sark that they are releasing these people [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4027.68s)]
*  And Israelis don't forget that in the last big hostage release [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4030.68s)]
*  For Gilad Shalita, the Israeli soldier [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4033.68s)]
*  That among the Palestinian prisoners released [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4036.68s)]
*  Was Yaya Sinwar who then went on to play a leading role [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4039.68s)]
*  In Hamas again and was the mastermind [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4042.68s)]
*  Of the October 7 attacks until he was killed [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4045.68s)]
*  By Israel in the Gaza Strip [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4048.68s)]
*  Enormous interest, everyone watching this [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4051.68s)]
*  Jonah with bated breath [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4054.68s)]
*  Just give us a little more description of what's happening [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4057.68s)]
*  Where you are, we've seen where Anaphos is [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4060.68s)]
*  And hostages squares, it's come to be known now around the Israel Museum [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4063.68s)]
*  So many people gathering there around the big screens [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4066.68s)]
*  There must be a lot of media where you are [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4069.68s)]
*  Are there other people in a city where, as you know [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4072.68s)]
*  On almost every street there are big banners of the hostages [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4075.68s)]
*  Nobody wants to forget about the hostages [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4078.68s)]
*  Are the crowds gathering there as well? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4081.68s)]
*  They're not gathering here as well [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4084.68s)]
*  I don't think they've been allowed in [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4087.68s)]
*  Perhaps if Anastasia, the camera lady here [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4090.68s)]
*  Anastasia, can we just swing the camera around a bit [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4093.68s)]
*  I think she might be able to find up over in this direction [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4096.68s)]
*  If she just carries on looking around [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4099.68s)]
*  So there's quite a lot of media here waiting for this moment [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4102.68s)]
*  To take place when we imagine that the hostages [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4105.68s)]
*  Are going to be driven along that road [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4108.68s)]
*  And then into the hospital over here [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4111.68s)]
*  Past the tarpaulin [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4114.68s)]
*  So there's quite a lot of interest [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4117.68s)]
*  But I think the big gathering here in Tel Aviv is the so-called [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4120.68s)]
*  The [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4123.68s)]
*  The helicopter will land [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4129.320000000001s)]
*  They will be driven in [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4132.320000000001s)]
*  But as we've been discussing [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4135.320000000001s)]
*  Given what has happened to these three women [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4138.320000000001s)]
*  Given the experiences they may have [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4141.320000000001s)]
*  Given their medical needs [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4144.320000000001s)]
*  This is not going to be a moment for them to come out [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4147.320000000001s)]
*  And talk to the media, to talk to people most likely [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4150.320000000001s)]
*  To receive quite possibly the medical attention they need [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4153.32s)]
*  And of course for them to be with their families [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4156.32s)]
*  As you mentioned Jonah, the first sighting [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4162.32s)]
*  That anyone may get may be those helicopters [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4165.32s)]
*  In the air above that hospital [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4168.32s)]
*  That may be the first real confirmation [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4171.32s)]
*  Aside from any government statements [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4174.32s)]
*  That they are now on Israeli soil again [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4177.32s)]
*  And the fact that they are on the ground [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4180.32s)]
*  And that they are on the screens [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4183.32s)]
*  And that clock which has been counting literally the seconds [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4186.32s)]
*  That the hostages have been in captivity [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4189.32s)]
*  We'll leave you there Jonah, I know you'll join us again [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4192.32s)]
*  When you get any updates but let's return now [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4195.32s)]
*  To our colleague Anna Foster from Hostages Square [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4198.32s)]
*  Anna, do the crowds get bigger [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4201.32s)]
*  As the moment approaches where there will be this announcement [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4204.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly Lise, you might have heard actually [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4207.32s)]
*  The sound of a cheer going up here in Hostages Square [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4210.32s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, everybody here is desperate [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4213.32s)]
*  For any kind of news, any indication [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4216.32s)]
*  That those three women have been handed over to the Red Cross [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4219.32s)]
*  And what they are watching, you can sort of see on this big screen [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4222.32s)]
*  What they are watching is Israeli TV [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4225.32s)]
*  But rebroadcasting pictures from Gaza [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4228.32s)]
*  Now what I can tell you, you might be able to see these [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4231.32s)]
*  In the live picture [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4234.32s)]
*  But it looks like those Red Cross vehicles [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4237.32s)]
*  Are starting to move [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4240.32s)]
*  You can see those huge crowds that are pressing in around them [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4243.32s)]
*  You can see [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4246.32s)]
*  Members of Hamas with their faces covered [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4249.32s)]
*  Holding weapons that look like they are on the back of that vehicle [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4252.32s)]
*  But what people here have been watching for [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4255.32s)]
*  And responding to, they are looking for any glimpse [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4258.32s)]
*  Of those women basically being handed over [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4261.32s)]
*  And put into those vehicles [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4264.32s)]
*  There have been a couple of moments [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4267.32s)]
*  You can hear it again, listen [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4270.32s)]
*  Where people are applauding and cheering [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4273.32s)]
*  I'm just looking in this direction as are you actually [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4276.32s)]
*  I'm looking at the big screen as well at the moment [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4279.32s)]
*  Because that's where we are getting the indication of what is happening [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4282.32s)]
*  People actually watching themselves on the other half of this big screen [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4285.32s)]
*  Pictures keep freezing from Gaza as well [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4288.32s)]
*  So we keep getting these long periods of time [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4291.32s)]
*  Where the shot is actually frozen and people are just waiting [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4294.32s)]
*  For it to start moving again [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4297.32s)]
*  Now Reuters have [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4300.32s)]
*  Say they have been told by a representative from [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4303.32s)]
*  The International Committee of the Red Cross [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4306.32s)]
*  That the handover has begun [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4309.32s)]
*  Quite what that looks like, it's very difficult to tell [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4312.32s)]
*  And this is the last ceasefire and hostage release [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4315.32s)]
*  It's really, when you start to see [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4318.32s)]
*  Those Red Cross vehicles actually on the move [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4321.32s)]
*  That is the key moment when they start to move through Gaza [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4324.32s)]
*  At the moment these pictures [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4327.32s)]
*  That people here are watching really on tenterhooks [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4330.32s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4333.32s)]
*  They are waiting for those vehicles to start moving [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4336.32s)]
*  The camera is looking inside [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4339.32s)]
*  Now I think you can see the same pictures that I can see [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4342.32s)]
*  On this big screen [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4345.32s)]
*  And we're just trying to make sense of what we're seeing here [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4348.32s)]
*  You see that looks [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4354.32s)]
*  You see at the back there [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4357.32s)]
*  Looks like they're trying to close the doors [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4360.32s)]
*  I mean this is the real key moment [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4363.32s)]
*  And in fact it's worth saying this is a moment that people feared [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4366.32s)]
*  Much earlier in the day [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4369.32s)]
*  That they might not see, that might not happen [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4372.32s)]
*  When that ceasefire was delayed [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4375.32s)]
*  It was supposed to happen at 8.30 this morning, local time [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4378.32s)]
*  And it didn't actually come into force until 11.15 at the end [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4381.32s)]
*  People were worried that this timetable would slip [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4384.32s)]
*  But what you're seeing now is [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4387.32s)]
*  What looks very much like it, just a very chaotic handover [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4390.32s)]
*  Of those three Israeli hostages [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4393.32s)]
*  So I'm still sort of watching what is going on here [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4396.32s)]
*  What they're doing actually is they're repeating now [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4399.32s)]
*  This is a loop, a repeating loop of pictures [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4402.32s)]
*  A very short loop that they're sort of showing over and over again [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4405.32s)]
*  But what it appears to show [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4408.32s)]
*  Is those three hostages being handed over [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4411.32s)]
*  Three women whose names were confirmed earlier [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4414.32s)]
*  Emily Demary, who is the hostages' name [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4417.32s)]
*  And the other three women [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4420.32s)]
*  Who's names were confirmed earlier, Emily Demary [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4423.32s)]
*  Who's that 28-year-old [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4426.32s)]
*  British Israeli national [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4429.32s)]
*  Who was taken from Kibbutz Kfar Aza [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4432.32s)]
*  The crowd cheering around me again [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4435.32s)]
*  Also Romy Gunan [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4438.32s)]
*  Who was taken at the Nova Music Festival [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4441.32s)]
*  She was 23 years old when she was abducted [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4444.32s)]
*  She was believed to have been shot in the hand as well [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4447.32s)]
*  She was taken at the Nova Music Festival [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4450.32s)]
*  On the phone to her mum at the moment when she was abducted [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4453.32s)]
*  And also Doron Steinbrecher, who was a veterinary nurse [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4456.32s)]
*  She also lived in Kfar Aza [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4459.32s)]
*  She was taken from her apartment on the 7th of October [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4462.32s)]
*  And people here in the square in Tel Aviv [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4468.32s)]
*  Are really responding to those pictures [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4471.32s)]
*  They're listening to what the Israeli news presenter [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4475.32s)]
*  Is saying as various bits of information are coming in [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4478.32s)]
*  We can speak to Jonah Fisher again, our correspondent [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4481.32s)]
*  Who is outside Chiba Hospital [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4484.32s)]
*  Jonah, obviously where you are is [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4487.32s)]
*  What we're watching here is very much the start of the process [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4490.32s)]
*  It looks very chaotic [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4493.32s)]
*  When the hostages get to where you are [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4496.32s)]
*  It is sort of the end of that handover process really [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4499.32s)]
*  I imagine you and many of the world's media [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4502.32s)]
*  Are there waiting for that part of the handover as well [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4505.32s)]
*  What we're expecting to happen next, Anna [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4508.32s)]
*  Because the footage from Gaza [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4511.32s)]
*  Seems to show the three hostages [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4514.32s)]
*  Being transferred over to the Red Cross [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4517.32s)]
*  Is that they will be taken by the Red Cross [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4520.32s)]
*  To the IDF inside Gaza [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4523.32s)]
*  The Israeli forces there [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4526.32s)]
*  Then they will be taken across the border into Israel [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4529.32s)]
*  It is probably going to be at that point [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4532.32s)]
*  At a settlement called Reim [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4535.32s)]
*  Where they will be reunited possibly with their family members [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4538.32s)]
*  At that point [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4541.32s)]
*  From what we know about the way that these three women [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4544.32s)]
*  Were captured on the 7th of October, 2023 [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4547.32s)]
*  It is likely that at least two of them [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4550.32s)]
*  Have injuries dating back to then [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4553.32s)]
*  They have problems associated with being kept in captivity [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4556.32s)]
*  In Gaza for 15 months [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4559.32s)]
*  They may have been badly treated, have kept in tunnels [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4562.32s)]
*  Once they are at Reim, we are expecting them to be [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4565.32s)]
*  Put on a helicopter and flown here to where I am now [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4568.32s)]
*  Which is a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4571.32s)]
*  When they come here, they will land [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4574.32s)]
*  A short distance over there [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4577.32s)]
*  Then they will be brought along the road here [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4580.32s)]
*  This is where they are going to go through [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4583.32s)]
*  This is not going to be a public event [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4586.32s)]
*  The priority here is the privacy, understandably [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4589.32s)]
*  Of the hostages and their families [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4592.32s)]
*  As part of this process [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4595.32s)]
*  Efforts are being made to make sure that [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4598.32s)]
*  This is essentially a private moment [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4601.32s)]
*  They will be transferred into the hospital here [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4604.32s)]
*  And one would imagine that they will get medical treatment [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4607.32s)]
*  And obviously that will be the start of [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4610.32s)]
*  Their lives in freedom having been released [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4613.32s)]
*  We are not at all clear what the timeframe for this is [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4616.32s)]
*  But now that we have seen that the handover has happened [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4619.32s)]
*  In Gaza into Red Cross hands [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4622.32s)]
*  One could imagine that probably in the next few hours [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4625.32s)]
*  We might see those three female hostages [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4628.32s)]
*  Dora and Steinbrecher, Emily, Damari and Romy [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4631.32s)]
*  Going in, brought here [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4634.32s)]
*  And obviously started receiving some medical treatment [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4637.32s)]
*  Thank you, Jonah Fisher [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4647.32s)]
*  Our correspondent there at Sheba Hospital [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4650.32s)]
*  I can tell you as well that the IDF [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4653.32s)]
*  The Israel Defence Forces have made an announcement now [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4656.32s)]
*  Saying that the Red Cross has communicated that the three [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4659.32s)]
*  Israeli hostages were transferred to them [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4662.32s)]
*  And they are on their way towards IDF and ISA forces [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4665.32s)]
*  In the Gaza Strip [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4668.32s)]
*  So basically the pictures that you are still seeing [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4671.32s)]
*  In the background here, that is a loop of a handover [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4674.32s)]
*  That has already happened and those Red Cross vehicles [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4677.32s)]
*  Are now moving through Gaza [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4680.32s)]
*  Towards that handover point [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4683.32s)]
*  Now as Jonah was explaining there, everything has been [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4686.32s)]
*  Has been put in place, this was a process [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4689.32s)]
*  This is the last ceasefire where Hamas [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4692.32s)]
*  Hands the hostages over to the Red Cross [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4695.32s)]
*  As we have been seeing [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4698.32s)]
*  We have seen in the past different routes being used [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4701.32s)]
*  There was one particular occasion, one hostage release [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4704.32s)]
*  Where they were actually brought a different route out of Gaza [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4707.32s)]
*  Instead of being taken down to the south, they were actually [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4710.32s)]
*  Brought out through a much quicker route, halfway down the strip [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4713.32s)]
*  Because one of the hostages needed urgent medical attention [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4716.32s)]
*  But the way that these things normally work is that they go down [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4719.32s)]
*  They are handed over to IDF forces and we have been watching [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4722.32s)]
*  Those live pictures as well of Reim in the south [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4725.32s)]
*  Of Israel [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4728.32s)]
*  Where the Israel Defense Forces [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4731.32s)]
*  Will take possession, if you like [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4734.32s)]
*  Of the hostages, they will check them over [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4737.32s)]
*  And then they will take them as quickly as possible [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4740.32s)]
*  They take them by helicopter just to make that journey [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4743.32s)]
*  As quick as possible, they will take them to Sheba Hospital [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4746.32s)]
*  Where we were seeing and hearing Jonah [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4749.32s)]
*  Just a few minutes ago, and then that process [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4752.32s)]
*  Of rehabilitation, of medical treatment [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4755.32s)]
*  But also crucially of reuniting them with their families [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4758.32s)]
*  That will begin [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4761.32s)]
*  One element of what is happening just at the moment [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4764.32s)]
*  Also we have been watching the scenes at Offa Prison as well [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4767.32s)]
*  In the occupied West Bank where Palestinian prisoners will be released [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4770.32s)]
*  They will climb onto buses [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4773.32s)]
*  And they will be taken to also be reunited [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4776.32s)]
*  With their loved ones as well [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4779.32s)]
*  You can see the pictures of preparations there at Offa Prison [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4782.32s)]
*  Things happen in a certain order as well [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4785.32s)]
*  The music is getting very loud by the way [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4788.32s)]
*  As you can hear behind me [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4791.32s)]
*  It happens in a certain order and the handover of the hostages [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4794.32s)]
*  Has to happen before the release of the Palestinian prisoners [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4797.32s)]
*  Let's just have a listen to what people in Jerusalem [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4800.32s)]
*  Had to say about the ceasefire deal [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4803.32s)]
*  The hostages have to come back [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4807.32s)]
*  It's a very, very difficult deal [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4810.32s)]
*  Lots of terrorists are being released and it's terrible [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4813.32s)]
*  But we have no option [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4816.32s)]
*  And another thing is that it's not such a great deal for us either [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4819.32s)]
*  I'm just praying that most of the hostages come home alive, please God [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4822.32s)]
*  And that this suffering ends for them [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4825.32s)]
*  They will come back to kill [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4828.32s)]
*  We know it for sure [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4831.32s)]
*  And it's very hard what we are doing [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4834.32s)]
*  And it's very hard, we're dealing with the terrorists [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4837.32s)]
*  They're cheating us every time again and again [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4840.32s)]
*  And we feel very, very heavy [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4843.32s)]
*  It's like a heavy feeling, I can't do nothing [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4846.32s)]
*  I'm always thinking about the terrorists going back to Jerusalem [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4849.32s)]
*  The way I see it [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4852.32s)]
*  It's a bad deal to do the worst deal [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4855.32s)]
*  Unfortunately we're going to do that [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4858.32s)]
*  But it's very, very hard [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4861.32s)]
*  Nobody is really happy about what's going to happen [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4864.32s)]
*  We're happy to release the hostages [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4867.32s)]
*  We're really happy to have them home [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4870.32s)]
*  But we know what the cost is going to be [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4873.32s)]
*  Well that is what people in Jerusalem were saying a little earlier today [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4879.32s)]
*  About that ceasefire [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4882.32s)]
*  And you saw and heard the atmosphere there [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4885.32s)]
*  And I just want to show you and really bring you into this picture [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4888.32s)]
*  That you're seeing here [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4891.32s)]
*  It's not officially called Hostages Square in Tel Aviv [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4894.32s)]
*  It's the square outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4897.32s)]
*  But it is a place that has become synonymous with the Israeli hostages [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4900.32s)]
*  In the 470 days since they were taken [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4903.32s)]
*  And you can hear the very loud music [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4906.32s)]
*  That's being played [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4909.32s)]
*  Many people have got their phone torches in the air [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4912.32s)]
*  They're joining in, they're singing with this music [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4915.32s)]
*  The volume has really been turned up [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4918.32s)]
*  Just in the last few minutes [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4921.32s)]
*  And that has coincided with the announcement from the IDF [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4924.32s)]
*  The Israel Defense Forces [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4927.32s)]
*  That those three hostages have been handed across [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4930.32s)]
*  Let's have a look at [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4933.32s)]
*  Pictures in Reim [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4936.32s)]
*  Reim in the south of Israel [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4939.32s)]
*  Is where those hostages are going to be handed over [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4942.32s)]
*  And also off of prison in the occupied West Bank as well [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4945.32s)]
*  We were looking earlier on at the buses there [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4948.32s)]
*  That will be used to take Palestinian prisoners [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4951.32s)]
*  To reunite them with their families [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4954.32s)]
*  So there are a few different things going on at the moment [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4957.32s)]
*  We're going to be bringing you obviously live pictures [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4960.32s)]
*  Of those different locations as we're speaking [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4963.32s)]
*  So you can see exactly what's happening [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4966.32s)]
*  So this is off the prison that you're watching at the moment [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4969.32s)]
*  We saw some people gathering there earlier on today [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4972.32s)]
*  Waiting for that [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4975.32s)]
*  Hand over essentially that freeing of Palestinian prisoners [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4978.32s)]
*  Around 90 of them are supposed to be released [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4981.32s)]
*  As part of the first phase of this deal [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4984.32s)]
*  30 or so Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli hostage [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4987.32s)]
*  That are released today [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4990.32s)]
*  The majority of them today we're told are women [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4993.32s)]
*  With around 10 or so men [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4996.32s)]
*  But as you can see the scene behind me here [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=4999.32s)]
*  The sound that you're also hearing now as well [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5002.32s)]
*  That is Israeli TV news [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5005.32s)]
*  Which is being broadcast on the big screen there behind me [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5008.32s)]
*  People now going very quiet [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5011.32s)]
*  To listen to what's being said [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5014.32s)]
*  And you can see the crumb of information [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5017.32s)]
*  As it's imparted there [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5020.32s)]
*  So you can see really [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5023.32s)]
*  It is a lot busier [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5026.32s)]
*  I've been talking to you all day today [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5029.32s)]
*  From here in Hostages Square [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5032.32s)]
*  And you can really see how the numbers have swelled [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5035.32s)]
*  From earlier on today [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5038.32s)]
*  This is often a place that people are drawn to [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5041.32s)]
*  Every Saturday night there was one yesterday evening as well [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5044.32s)]
*  Where people come [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5047.32s)]
*  Often they're addressed by families of the hostages [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5050.32s)]
*  There have been released hostages [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5053.32s)]
*  Who have come here and taken to the stage [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5056.32s)]
*  And actually addressed the crowds here as well [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5059.32s)]
*  When you look around this place as well [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5062.32s)]
*  You are surrounded by the faces and the images [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5065.32s)]
*  And the names of those hostages [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5068.32s)]
*  It's been such an integral part of the Israeli consciousness [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5071.32s)]
*  For the last 15 months [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5074.32s)]
*  While this war has gone on [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5077.32s)]
*  And a lot of the pressure on the Israeli government has come from here as well [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5080.32s)]
*  People here [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5083.32s)]
*  Some of those hostage families have been unhappy with the government's handling [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5086.32s)]
*  Of this day they feel like it should have taken 470 days [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5089.32s)]
*  For their loved ones to be released [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5092.32s)]
*  They wanted to see a deal achieved far sooner [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5095.32s)]
*  There's been a lot of emotion this war [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5098.32s)]
*  I remember the time of the last ceasefire [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5101.32s)]
*  When there was almost a celebratory atmosphere [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5104.32s)]
*  A relief as people were being released last time round [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5107.32s)]
*  This has been a scene at times of anger as well [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5110.32s)]
*  But what it is at the moment is people gathering [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5113.32s)]
*  In quite some numbers [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5116.32s)]
*  Watching and waiting [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5119.32s)]
*  As the three Israeli hostages who have been released today [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5122.32s)]
*  With the Red Cross [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5125.32s)]
*  Are making their way towards the southern part of Gaza [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5128.32s)]
*  Where they'll be handed over to the Israeli military [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5131.32s)]
*  And that process will begin to actually get them back [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5134.32s)]
*  Onto Israeli soil [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5137.32s)]
*  And then of course the release of Palestinian prisoners will begin as well [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5140.32s)]
*  And I think Lis Ducet, our chief international correspondent [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5143.32s)]
*  Who's still with us [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5146.32s)]
*  I think there's a sense of relief for many people at this point [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5149.32s)]
*  Because 10 or so hours ago [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5152.32s)]
*  It looked like this deal may falter before it even began [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5155.32s)]
*  People thought that they might not see [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5158.32s)]
*  What they're seeing now at Ofer prison [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5161.32s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5164.32s)]
*  And I think there is a huge amount of relief that this ceasefire did come into place [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5167.32s)]
*  And so far is holding and appears to be going according to that [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5170.32s)]
*  That very delicate and detailed plan [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5173.32s)]
*  Yes, and the hours it has taken [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5177.32s)]
*  From the moment where the ceasefire [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5180.32s)]
*  Finally began after a three hour delay [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5183.32s)]
*  The process began of handing over three women [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5186.32s)]
*  The first three hostages to be released [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5189.32s)]
*  In this first phase which is called the humanitarian phase [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5192.32s)]
*  In exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5195.32s)]
*  For three Israeli hostages [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5198.32s)]
*  And we understand that there will be [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5201.32s)]
*  50 Palestinian prisoners released [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5204.32s)]
*  For every Israeli female soldier [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5207.32s)]
*  Who is expected to be released in this first phase [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5210.32s)]
*  And now it's just down to the final [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5213.32s)]
*  Mimics and these extraordinary scenes Anna [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5216.32s)]
*  Where you are, everyone could be watching that at home [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5219.32s)]
*  But this desire to be there, to be in that square [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5222.32s)]
*  Where so many people as you mentioned have gone there [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5225.32s)]
*  Some people have been going there day after day [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5228.32s)]
*  Because it is a place where they have found solace [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5231.32s)]
*  Where they have been able to raise their voices [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5234.32s)]
*  As you say, the mood in that square has changed [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5237.32s)]
*  Over the last 15 months [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5240.32s)]
*  Now there's been a lot of anger because when they hear reports [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5243.32s)]
*  That the ceasefire which was finally agreed [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5246.32s)]
*  Was the ceasefire which was on the table in May [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5249.32s)]
*  So said President Joe Biden and they feel that [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5252.32s)]
*  Time has been wasted, lives have been lost [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5255.32s)]
*  The Palestinian lives have been lost in the thousands [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5258.32s)]
*  So too they are not sure how many Israeli hostages [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5261.32s)]
*  Would have died in captivity [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5264.32s)]
*  But these are these final moments where [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5267.32s)]
*  Moments of tension, moments of happiness, people [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5270.32s)]
*  Holding their breath and this will be watched [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5273.32s)]
*  Across Israel, a nation where [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5276.32s)]
*  It's extraordinary that in Israel they say [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5279.32s)]
*  As you've heard it so many times Anna, how the country [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5282.32s)]
*  Believes that they changed forever after October the 7th [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5285.32s)]
*  Everywhere you go and today in that square the banners [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5288.32s)]
*  Of the hostages, they line all the streets and squares [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5291.32s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, in many other cities, they line [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5294.32s)]
*  The hallways in Israel's the international [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5297.32s)]
*  Airport in Ben Gurion just outside [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5300.32s)]
*  Tel Aviv, they feel that these are their sisters [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5303.32s)]
*  And brothers and family members [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5306.32s)]
*  That there's been this solidarity and solidarity among the families too [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5309.32s)]
*  And people will be watching around the world because [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5312.32s)]
*  This is such as one of those exquisite [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5315.32s)]
*  Human moments of rare happiness [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5318.32s)]
*  Which will give rise to cautious hope [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5321.32s)]
*  That this can be the beginning of something [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5324.32s)]
*  Where all of the hostages will go home [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5327.32s)]
*  Those who are alive and the remains of those [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5330.32s)]
*  Who did not survive so that their family knows [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5333.32s)]
*  At least what happened and then the hundreds [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5336.32s)]
*  Of Palestinian prisoners who will go home [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5339.32s)]
*  Many of them have been languishing in prison under [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5342.32s)]
*  Administrative detention, not yet being charged [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5345.32s)]
*  Never knowing when they would be free [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5348.32s)]
*  This is a time of intense emotion [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5351.32s)]
*  On both sides in this deeply, deeply [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5354.32s)]
*  Political deal [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5357.32s)]
*  In a war that this region has never [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5360.32s)]
*  The likes of which the region has never seen and so many hope [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5363.32s)]
*  That there will be an end to that war but it's fraught with risk [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5366.32s)]
*  But this moment is one, a very, very human moment [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5369.32s)]
*  Yeah, it is [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5372.32s)]
*  And you can see from the reaction here [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5375.32s)]
*  You can see from people's faces, you can see families [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5378.32s)]
*  Holding each other, parents putting their arms around children [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5381.32s)]
*  People wrapped, looking at the screen [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5384.32s)]
*  Cheering, you know, those explosive [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5387.32s)]
*  Impressions of joy [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5390.32s)]
*  This is just the smallest, smallest moment, the suggestion [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5393.32s)]
*  That those women were being handed over, somebody's back in a vehicle [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5396.32s)]
*  And the way that people cheered and whooped [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5399.32s)]
*  While we're speaking, Lisa, as well, we're staying on these live pictures [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5402.32s)]
*  Of Reim in southern Israel, we're seeing minibuses [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5405.32s)]
*  Pulling up to the helicopters [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5408.32s)]
*  Because the next stage will be [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5411.32s)]
*  To take those three hostages to Sheba Hospital [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5414.32s)]
*  Where preparations have been put in place [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5417.32s)]
*  To receive them [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5420.32s)]
*  And then also after that, again, as you were saying, Lisa [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5423.32s)]
*  We will see the release of 90 or so Palestinian prisoners today [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5426.32s)]
*  And this is something that the deal has on repeat [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5429.32s)]
*  Isn't it? It's three phases [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5432.32s)]
*  But this first phase, this first six weeks [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5435.32s)]
*  42 days, there's a lot of movement like this to come [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5438.32s)]
*  If all goes well, isn't there? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5441.32s)]
*  Yes, three every Saturday [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5445.32s)]
*  For the next several weeks [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5448.32s)]
*  And then perhaps on the last Saturday, what's supposed to be the end [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5451.32s)]
*  Of this first phase, the remaining alive [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5454.32s)]
*  Women and children [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5457.32s)]
*  The elderly will be released [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5460.32s)]
*  And then that will, well [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5463.32s)]
*  The discussions, the negotiations, which are certain to be very, very difficult [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5466.32s)]
*  Far more difficult than for this first phase [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5469.32s)]
*  16 days into this process as well [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5472.32s)]
*  The negotiations will begin on that second phase [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5475.32s)]
*  Where they will then discuss the freeing of the male soldiers [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5478.32s)]
*  And Hamas, this terrible, terrible [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5481.32s)]
*  Trade in human lives [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5484.32s)]
*  Will be demanding a higher number of prisoners [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5487.32s)]
*  Because they see them as, and it's horrible to be able to say it [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5490.32s)]
*  But such is the nature of this merciless war [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5493.32s)]
*  And Palestinians describe [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5496.32s)]
*  Their people in prison as hostages too [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5499.32s)]
*  Being held there against as well, not being charged [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5502.32s)]
*  And so there's a price in this process [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5505.32s)]
*  So in that second phase it will be the male soldiers [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5508.32s)]
*  And that's why, Anna, we've been hearing, you've been hearing when you speak to people [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5511.32s)]
*  That of those holding their breath, it is [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5514.32s)]
*  The people who know, whose male relatives [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5517.32s)]
*  Who are soldiers or who are young [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5520.32s)]
*  They know they will not be released in this first phase [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5523.32s)]
*  And I think that's the joy of the families who will share their loved ones [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5526.32s)]
*  Because it's been this intense coming together of all the families [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5529.32s)]
*  Sharing in their joys, even those who've lost their loved ones [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5532.32s)]
*  They rejoice when they see someone else's [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5535.32s)]
*  Relatives, sister, daughter [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5538.32s)]
*  Grandfather, father coming home because they [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5541.32s)]
*  Somehow feel that that's something [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5544.32s)]
*  That's something for them as well, even though their own [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5547.32s)]
*  Relative didn't survive this [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5550.32s)]
*  And so today there will be [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5553.32s)]
*  Rejoicing among all the hostage families, even those [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5556.32s)]
*  Who are hoping against hope that this moves to the second phase [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5559.32s)]
*  And that there is a chance in the second phase [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5562.32s)]
*  After those first 42 days, if all goes smoothly [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5565.32s)]
*  That there will be [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5568.32s)]
*  Then the beginning of a process that they too [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5571.32s)]
*  Can have an evening like this where they are within [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5574.32s)]
*  Literally touching distance of embracing [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5577.32s)]
*  Their loved ones again, something that they [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5580.32s)]
*  Every day they've lived this nightmare of never knowing [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5583.32s)]
*  Whether, and they still don't know, whether their loved ones [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5586.32s)]
*  Will finally come home alive [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5589.32s)]
*  We were talking earlier here in the square [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5592.32s)]
*  To exactly one of those mums, her son Tamir [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5595.32s)]
*  A soldier, he was based at Erez that day [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5598.32s)]
*  She was saying that she has heard nothing [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5601.32s)]
*  Nothing at all, doesn't know if he is alive [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5604.32s)]
*  She doesn't know if he has been killed in captivity [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5607.32s)]
*  But something she said was really interesting [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5610.32s)]
*  And she was absolutely sharing those sentiments that you described there, Lisa [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5613.32s)]
*  The joy for fellow hostage families, people who have been bound together [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5616.32s)]
*  By these most traumatic circumstances [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5619.32s)]
*  Who have gained strength and support from each other [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5622.32s)]
*  But what she was saying she was worried about is [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5625.32s)]
*  The fewer hostages that are still being held [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5628.32s)]
*  She was concerned that attention would be drawn away [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5631.32s)]
*  International pressure would be drawn away [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5634.32s)]
*  As those numbers of hostages being held in Gaza dwindled [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5637.32s)]
*  Because that's been a big part of this, hasn't it? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5640.32s)]
*  That's why hostage families have talked about their ordeal [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5643.32s)]
*  That's why they've been so keen to put their [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5646.32s)]
*  The pictures, the images of their loved ones in the public eye [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5649.32s)]
*  Because they know that often it is international pressure [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5652.32s)]
*  That leads to a breakthrough like this one [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5655.32s)]
*  Yes, they must be hoping tonight [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5659.32s)]
*  That in being part of this extraordinary moment [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5662.32s)]
*  This roller coaster of a moment [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5665.32s)]
*  That the nation will rally then [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5668.32s)]
*  And will demand with even stronger voice [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5671.32s)]
*  That this process has to continue [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5674.32s)]
*  That the hostages must be made the priority [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5677.32s)]
*  In these efforts to try to end the war [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5680.32s)]
*  And we've seen, Anna, even senior Israeli [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5683.32s)]
*  Generals and the Israeli defense forces [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5686.32s)]
*  Even the defense minister who eventually [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5689.32s)]
*  Was let go, Yoav Galan, saying that [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5692.32s)]
*  We've achieved everything we can militarily in Gaza [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5695.32s)]
*  We must put the lives of the hostages first [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5698.32s)]
*  And it is, as you say, it has been the hostages family [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5701.32s)]
*  Not just gathering in Hostages Square, those marches [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5704.32s)]
*  That they've done, they were joined at one point by the [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5707.32s)]
*  Histrager trade unions, the largest trade union in Israel [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5710.32s)]
*  People coming together and raising their voice [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5713.32s)]
*  Marching towards Jerusalem to the prime minister's residence [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5716.32s)]
*  Who of course has been saying that he has been [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5719.32s)]
*  Putting the lives of the hostages first, that there was two war aims [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5722.32s)]
*  As he has said repeatedly, to destroy Hamas [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5725.32s)]
*  And to bring the hostages home, but there is so much [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5728.32s)]
*  Bitterness and anger as you've heard yourself among the [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5731.32s)]
*  Hostages family, they feel that they have been sacrificed [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5734.32s)]
*  And that the lives of their loved ones have not [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5737.32s)]
*  Been put first, and yes there is this fear that once the [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5740.32s)]
*  Women, the children, the elderly come home [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5743.32s)]
*  The most, the more vulnerable hostages come home [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5746.32s)]
*  That once it gets to the soldiers, the male soldiers [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5749.32s)]
*  That interest will not be sustained [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5752.32s)]
*  But there is a hope in this process that even though [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5755.32s)]
*  We hear about the risks, that once it starts [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5758.32s)]
*  And it's clearly starting now with, in all its intensity [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5761.32s)]
*  That there will be a momentum and it will be very difficult [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5764.32s)]
*  To stop this process as it starts moving in this direction [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5767.32s)]
*  And certainly we heard today from the Qatari government spokesman [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5770.32s)]
*  Majid Al Ansari, Qatari and Egypt are now going to play [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5773.32s)]
*  They played a key role in the mediation which got to this point [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5776.32s)]
*  They will now play a key role in the implementation of it [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5779.32s)]
*  For watching for the violations, having people on the ground [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5782.32s)]
*  To improve the logistics, they are calling them for international [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5785.32s)]
*  Pressure, they are hoping that the new administration [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5788.32s)]
*  Which takes charge tomorrow is going to be able to [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5791.32s)]
*  That the new administration which takes charge tomorrow in the White House [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5794.32s)]
*  That they won't stop at simply pushing this, helping to push [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5797.32s)]
*  And they played a big role in pushing it over the line [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5800.32s)]
*  President-elect Trump saying I want it done by the 20th [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5803.32s)]
*  Well it has been done by the 20th [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5806.32s)]
*  But they will have to be there at the table [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5809.32s)]
*  Putting pressure on both sides to keep this process going [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5812.32s)]
*  There are so many dangers along the way [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5815.32s)]
*  But people must be hoping [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5818.32s)]
*  And I am hoping against hope tonight that this will continue [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5821.32s)]
*  Palestinians want more prisoners to be released [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5824.32s)]
*  There are many, many thousands who are languishing in Israeli [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5827.32s)]
*  Detention centres and this is just the beginning [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5830.32s)]
*  And just the beginning to 97 [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5833.32s)]
*  Hostages of the more than 250 who were taken [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5836.32s)]
*  During that dreadful day of October [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5839.32s)]
*  The 7th, it's believed that possibly more than [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5842.32s)]
*  30 are not alive [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5845.32s)]
*  Right now the hope is that everyone who is alive [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5848.32s)]
*  Can be brought home and Anna [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5851.32s)]
*  We're about to see that very, very shortly [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5854.32s)]
*  Those pictures from Riem, the lights in the dark, those helicopters [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5857.32s)]
*  We heard from Jonah Fisher saying that [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5860.32s)]
*  Once those helicopters are in the air over the Sheba hospital [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5863.32s)]
*  That will be a confirmation that the hostages [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5866.32s)]
*  Are there, they're going to be brought in for medical treatment [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5869.32s)]
*  And indeed once we see them leaving, lifting off from Riem [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5872.32s)]
*  We will know and we expect Anna [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5875.32s)]
*  For there to be an announcement from an Israeli government official [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5878.32s)]
*  That once they are safely on Israeli soil [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5881.32s)]
*  We understand too they'll be meeting the families first [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5884.32s)]
*  That it'll be announced [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5887.32s)]
*  That Ronan and Emily and Romy are now free [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5890.32s)]
*  The first three are coming home [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5893.32s)]
*  And the International Committee of the Red Cross [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5896.32s)]
*  ICRC with their special responsibility for prisoners [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5899.32s)]
*  They are the keepers of the Geneva Conventions of War [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5902.32s)]
*  Very discreetly playing an absolutely crucial role [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5905.32s)]
*  In this very, very sensitive, very, very emotional process [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5908.32s)]
*  To ensure that nothing can go wrong [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5911.32s)]
*  And this can't be ruled out [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5914.32s)]
*  I mean this is a very fragile process [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5917.32s)]
*  But so far it's slowly, slowly [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5920.32s)]
*  We'll keep an eye on those pictures from Riem [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5923.32s)]
*  We'll keep an eye on the reaction where you are [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5926.32s)]
*  There's the clapping [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5929.32s)]
*  Yeah, as you say, Lise, we're watching those live pictures [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5935.32s)]
*  Of Riem in particular, we're expecting to see at some point [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5938.32s)]
*  Those helicopters lifting off, as you said [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5941.32s)]
*  Making the bayer, what will be a relatively short journey [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5944.32s)]
*  To Sheba Hospital, and you're right, when you talk about people's reactions [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5947.32s)]
*  And you can hear those occasional spontaneous outbursts [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5950.32s)]
*  Of clapping and cheering [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5953.32s)]
*  And there's a small thing, you know, just in front of me [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5956.32s)]
*  I'm watching a couple, and they have spent the last 15 minutes or so [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5959.32s)]
*  Inflating these bright yellow balloons [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5962.32s)]
*  And attaching them together into this column [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5965.32s)]
*  That stretches maybe 15 feet into the sky [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5968.32s)]
*  It looks very visually striking [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5971.32s)]
*  Among all of the yellow here, you know, the yellow has been the colour [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5974.32s)]
*  Of the hostages people wear, yellow ribbons [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5977.32s)]
*  They wear yellow flags just to the side of me [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5980.32s)]
*  But to look at that column of balloons rising into the sky [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5983.32s)]
*  And the fact that they've sat here and done that now [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5986.32s)]
*  It just shows you, it's almost like that collective [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5989.32s)]
*  Sort of loosening of the shoulders a little [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5992.32s)]
*  That little collective moment where people [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5995.32s)]
*  Who've been holding their breath take a breath out [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=5998.32s)]
*  And feel that they can start to celebrate [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6001.32s)]
*  You know, celebrate is such a strange word, isn't it? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6004.32s)]
*  Everything that it conjures up in the human experience [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6007.32s)]
*  But there is a sort of feeling of hope and positivity [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6010.32s)]
*  For the families of those three hostages [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6013.32s)]
*  And of course from fellow hostage families [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6016.32s)]
*  That wish and that will that they too [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6019.32s)]
*  Will find themselves in this position [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6022.32s)]
*  At some point very soon [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6025.32s)]
*  And also, Lise, you know, I'm here in Tel Aviv [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6028.32s)]
*  And the geography of this place [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6031.32s)]
*  Is so short [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6034.32s)]
*  That even as the IDF, the Israeli forces [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6037.32s)]
*  Are confirming now that they have received [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6040.32s)]
*  The hostages, that they are in the hands [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6043.32s)]
*  Of Israeli soldiers now [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6046.32s)]
*  So that process really has continued [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6049.32s)]
*  The geography of this place, Lise, it is not too many miles away [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6052.32s)]
*  To Gaza, to where this evening [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6055.32s)]
*  People are on the move, you know, it's dark here now [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6058.32s)]
*  Taking what they have back to see what remains [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6061.32s)]
*  Of their homes after 15 months of fighting [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6065.32s)]
*  You know, for so many people [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6068.32s)]
*  This has been a desperately, desperately [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6071.32s)]
*  Difficult time [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6074.32s)]
*  Yes, geographically very short distance [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6077.32s)]
*  But emotionally such a long distance [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6080.32s)]
*  People who have waited for the last 15 months [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6083.32s)]
*  For their loved ones to come home [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6086.32s)]
*  And you've been seeing in that hostages square, Anna [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6089.32s)]
*  I mean, it has grown, we've talked about how it has grown [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6092.32s)]
*  In emotion over the last 15 months [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6095.32s)]
*  But more, they've got that big clock where they literally count [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6098.32s)]
*  The seconds of captivity and in your reports earlier [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6101.32s)]
*  We saw people looking at that clock which was just behind you [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6104.32s)]
*  And then they produced a mock-up of the tunnels in Gaza [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6107.32s)]
*  To try to allow people to understand [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6110.32s)]
*  What it must be like for the hostages being held there [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6113.32s)]
*  In captivity and I think I heard the piano, there's a piano [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6116.32s)]
*  People come and play instruments as well [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6119.32s)]
*  Because it's meant to be a place, not just to mourn [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6122.32s)]
*  And to worry and fear, but also to bring, to lift spirits [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6125.32s)]
*  And we see in those images just behind you [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6128.32s)]
*  People embracing each other, you talked about those balloons [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6131.32s)]
*  And the music, you don't want to say [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6134.32s)]
*  It's hard to say celebration because it's very bittersweet [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6137.32s)]
*  No one should have had to have gone through this ordeal [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6140.32s)]
*  Not the people in that square where you are [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6143.32s)]
*  Surely not the people in Gaza [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6146.32s)]
*  The unbelievable, unprecedented losses [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6149.32s)]
*  In the Gaza Strip coming up to nearly 50,000 [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6152.32s)]
*  More than 46,000 Palestinians [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6155.32s)]
*  Have lost their lives according to figures [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6158.32s)]
*  From the health ministry, the Hamas health ministry [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6161.32s)]
*  In Gaza, thousands of children have been killed [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6164.32s)]
*  Have been maimed for life and of course [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6167.32s)]
*  We've seen the pictures today of people rushing on foot [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6170.32s)]
*  On bicycles, being pulled by horse or donkey carts [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6173.32s)]
*  Finally being able to go to their home [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6176.32s)]
*  And all that's left of their home are piles of rubble [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6179.32s)]
*  Everyone has suffered enormously [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6182.32s)]
*  In this conflict [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6185.32s)]
*  And it's not a matter of numbers [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6188.32s)]
*  There's profound suffering on all sides [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6191.32s)]
*  And tonight we're being reminded of the importance [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6194.32s)]
*  Of trying to bring this painful chapter to an end [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6197.32s)]
*  Even though this is just the start [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6200.32s)]
*  And we're not sure how and when it will end [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6203.32s)]
*  What we've been bringing you all through the day today [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6209.32s)]
*  Here on BBC News is continuing coverage [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6212.32s)]
*  Of this unfolding moment [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6215.32s)]
*  There have been times, as you were saying, Lisa [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6218.32s)]
*  Times in this square today, particularly when the [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6221.32s)]
*  Warm January sun was beating down a little earlier [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6224.32s)]
*  It was very peaceful, it was very quiet [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6227.32s)]
*  There was a small number of people here [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6230.32s)]
*  They come, they look at those various artworks [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6233.32s)]
*  You always see them looking at the names and faces [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6236.32s)]
*  Of the hostages and often you know those posters, those pictures [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6239.32s)]
*  You know, things like the ages [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6242.32s)]
*  So these were produced 15 months ago when people were taken [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6245.32s)]
*  And very often the ages are now out of date [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6248.32s)]
*  So you'll see where people have crossed out one age with a pen [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6251.32s)]
*  And then you'll see how they've increased it with the age they are now [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6254.32s)]
*  Because these people have been in captivity for more than a year [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6257.32s)]
*  Or you'll see stickers or drawings [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6260.32s)]
*  Things that have been added [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6263.32s)]
*  And we talk about that peaceful atmosphere that there was here earlier today [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6266.32s)]
*  What we're seeing here now and hearing here now [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6269.32s)]
*  These moments of relative calm and peace [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6272.32s)]
*  The beginnings of a chant that is growing at the front of that stage [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6275.32s)]
*  People are watching themselves on that big screen that we talked about [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6278.32s)]
*  There are three big screens here in the square [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6281.32s)]
*  That is one that has got that stark bright red clock [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6284.32s)]
*  Which counts up the number of days and hours [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6287.32s)]
*  That the hostages have been in captivity [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6290.32s)]
*  And what people are doing right now is watching themselves [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6293.32s)]
*  Standing here in the square in silence on the screen next to that [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6296.32s)]
*  We're seeing the faces of the three women now [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6299.32s)]
*  Who have been released [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6302.32s)]
*  Being projected onto that screen [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6305.32s)]
*  And people, they now know that these three women are in the hands of Israeli forces [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6308.32s)]
*  And what we will expect to see at a much later point [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6314.32s)]
*  And what we saw last time [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6317.32s)]
*  Is the images of those family reunions [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6320.32s)]
*  Because for people here today that is what it is about [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6323.32s)]
*  It is about bringing people home into the arms of their parents [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6326.32s)]
*  We were talking about Emily Demare earlier on, 28 years old [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6330.32s)]
*  She's a British-Israeli dual national [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6334.32s)]
*  And she's been in the arms of her mother, Andy [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6337.32s)]
*  Has been trying to raise awareness of her daughter's condition [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6340.32s)]
*  And now is waiting [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6343.32s)]
*  Can you imagine what it must be like [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6346.32s)]
*  To know that perhaps within the next hour or so [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6349.32s)]
*  You will be reunited with your loved one [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6352.32s)]
*  Who was taken from you in such traumatic circumstances [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6355.32s)]
*  To know that they are so close [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6358.32s)]
*  Most of us will never go through a moment like that [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6361.32s)]
*  That you can't imagine [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6364.32s)]
*  And similarly, we've seen those pictures in the occupied West Bank this evening [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6367.32s)]
*  Of Ofer prison [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6370.32s)]
*  Similarly there, we see Palestinian families waiting to be reunited with prisoners [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6373.32s)]
*  Who are being released 90 of them [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6376.32s)]
*  From Ofer prison a little bit later this evening [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6379.32s)]
*  And it is that ebb and flow of emotion [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6382.32s)]
*  You know, things that, they look very different in the square now [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6385.32s)]
*  That warm sun has gone down [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6388.32s)]
*  A sort of chill in the air this evening [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6391.32s)]
*  But really a sense of sort of relief [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6394.32s)]
*  That is starting to break through [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6397.32s)]
*  Still a sense of nervousness [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6400.32s)]
*  And as you said, Lise, quite rightly [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6403.32s)]
*  You know, you identified that this is day one [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6406.32s)]
*  Of what will be a very long process [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6409.32s)]
*  There will no doubt be bumps in the road [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6412.32s)]
*  Exactly like the one that we saw this morning [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6415.32s)]
*  It's really the impact on people [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6418.32s)]
*  As we've been saying, the impact on civilians here in Israel [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6421.32s)]
*  On civilians in Gaza [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6424.32s)]
*  You know, the many women and children who've been killed [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6427.32s)]
*  The many, many people who've been displaced [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6430.32s)]
*  Whenever we look at wars and conflicts around the world [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6433.32s)]
*  You know, we look at the numbers of people who've been killed [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6436.32s)]
*  We look at everything that goes on around them [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6439.32s)]
*  We talk about soldiers and weapons and wars [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6442.32s)]
*  And in among that is always [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6445.32s)]
*  You know, the people who were just trying to live their lives [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6448.32s)]
*  The people who haven't done anything [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6451.32s)]
*  The people who just wanted a peaceful, quiet, happy existence [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6454.32s)]
*  And find themselves wrapped up in all of this [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6457.32s)]
*  But the hope is, Lise, that if this ceasefire agreement plays out [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6460.32s)]
*  As it's supposed to [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6463.32s)]
*  That at least for some people there will be a peace of sorts [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6466.32s)]
*  I mean, a greater Middle East peace is no closer [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6469.32s)]
*  Than it's been at any time recently [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6472.32s)]
*  But just a personal peace is closer for many people [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6475.32s)]
*  Than it has been for 15 months [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6478.32s)]
*  You know, many say, Anna, that the scars of this war [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6485.32s)]
*  The real physical scars [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6488.32s)]
*  The psychological scars [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6491.32s)]
*  Could take a generation to heal [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6494.32s)]
*  And we're reminded of that tonight [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6497.32s)]
*  Everyone being on tender hooks [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6500.32s)]
*  The emotions being so raw [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6503.32s)]
*  That you can feel them where you are [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6506.32s)]
*  And literally people are staring into the darkness [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6509.32s)]
*  The picture is now live shot coming from Riem [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6512.32s)]
*  They're just inside the Israeli border [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6515.32s)]
*  Where those helicopters have been waiting [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6518.32s)]
*  There just was a close-up of the helicopters [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6521.32s)]
*  If to remind people that when you see that helicopter [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6524.32s)]
*  The hostages, those three people [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6527.32s)]
*  Will be inside [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6530.32s)]
*  Being taken to Sheva Hospital [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6533.32s)]
*  Let's just watch those [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6536.32s)]
*  Literally it's these throbbing, they're now the helicopter again [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6539.32s)]
*  You can barely make it out [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6542.32s)]
*  Everyone wants to see this as it unfolds [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6545.32s)]
*  Extraordinary thing about live television in our time [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6548.32s)]
*  Everyone is being brought to that darkness [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6551.32s)]
*  Literally in that darkness [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6554.32s)]
*  Coming out of the darkness of Gaza [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6557.32s)]
*  Coming out from those underground tunnels [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6560.32s)]
*  These three women, it's unlikely they saw [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6563.32s)]
*  Any sunshine at all [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6566.32s)]
*  They're believed to have been held underground [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6569.32s)]
*  Although not all of them have been [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6572.32s)]
*  But they have been held in confinement [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6575.32s)]
*  They're now, the lights are not sure [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6578.32s)]
*  Where you are Anna, that they're still watching that screen [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6581.32s)]
*  As we all are, there's now some movement [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6584.32s)]
*  Waiting [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6587.32s)]
*  Just to [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6590.32s)]
*  Now we can see in that darkness [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6593.32s)]
*  There's two helicopters that will [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6596.32s)]
*  Bring the three women, they'll be escorted [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6599.32s)]
*  By the ICRC, they'll be brought there by [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6602.32s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces, who as you said Anna [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6605.32s)]
*  That they have the three women [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6608.32s)]
*  That they've left the Gaza Strip [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6611.32s)]
*  It's hard to see in the darkness [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6614.32s)]
*  But that they're preparing to lift off [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6617.32s)]
*  We're not seeing any movement yet of people [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6620.32s)]
*  But the fact that they're now focusing on the helicopters [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6623.32s)]
*  May give us a hint that we may soon see [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6626.32s)]
*  Some movement towards [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6629.32s)]
*  Towards those two helicopters [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6632.32s)]
*  A lot of people waiting [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6635.32s)]
*  Everyone's waiting [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6638.32s)]
*  You can even see there as that camp people positions [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6641.32s)]
*  They're looking aren't they, looking and in fact the faces [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6644.32s)]
*  Of people here in the square, again you can see people [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6647.32s)]
*  At the front of the crowd, they are looking at those pictures [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6650.32s)]
*  Of themselves, they are looking at those same pictures [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6653.32s)]
*  The reaction when they saw the pictures [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6656.32s)]
*  From Gaza earlier, the first part of that handover [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6659.32s)]
*  They are watching and waiting [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6662.32s)]
*  And as you were saying Lise as well [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6665.32s)]
*  I think that image that everybody is waiting to see [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6668.32s)]
*  Now is of those helicopters lifting off [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6671.32s)]
*  Even though we know that these three women are now in Israeli hands [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6674.32s)]
*  It is very visible, a very physical sign [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6677.32s)]
*  That they are on their way home [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6680.32s)]
*  On their way back to their loved ones [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6683.32s)]
*  And as we continue to watch these live pictures [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6686.32s)]
*  What are you waiting for Lise isn't it? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6689.32s)]
*  Yes and as you say [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6692.32s)]
*  That it's not a long distance from Reim [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6695.32s)]
*  In southern Israel to the medical facility [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6698.32s)]
*  The Sheba medical facility where we've been hearing [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6701.32s)]
*  From our correspondent there Jonah Fishern [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6704.32s)]
*  We've seen behind him the walls going up [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6707.32s)]
*  Throughout the day and for obvious reasons [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6710.32s)]
*  They don't want the cameras of the world to be [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6713.32s)]
*  The women, the three women as they arrived [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6716.32s)]
*  Two of them were injured as they were seized [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6719.32s)]
*  And taken captive [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6722.32s)]
*  Nobody knows what kind of condition that they have been in [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6725.32s)]
*  Normally in these sort of situations [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6728.32s)]
*  The international committee, the Red Cross [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6731.32s)]
*  Would have been able to visit [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6734.32s)]
*  But there's been no visits, there's been no proof of life [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6737.32s)]
*  Or their conditions except in those horrendous videos [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6740.32s)]
*  And they are often released for propaganda reasons [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6743.32s)]
*  By Hamas where families know at least [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6746.32s)]
*  As hard as it is to look at the videos [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6749.32s)]
*  At least it shows that they're alive [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6752.32s)]
*  So yes, where you are across this nation [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6755.32s)]
*  Across the region and around the world [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6758.32s)]
*  People are now watching this moment [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6761.32s)]
*  And there'll be these moments [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6764.32s)]
*  Every Saturday for the next six weeks [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6767.32s)]
*  And I think that's going to be this kind of a process [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6770.32s)]
*  And the hostages who are coming home [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6773.32s)]
*  Will want to believe that their fate [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6776.32s)]
*  There'll be as much interest [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6779.32s)]
*  And solidarity as this process [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6782.32s)]
*  Continues to unfold [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6785.32s)]
*  Most of all everyone hopes that [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6788.32s)]
*  Except for the critics of this deal [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6791.32s)]
*  And there are those loud voices on both sides [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6794.32s)]
*  And I think that this process continues [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6797.32s)]
*  We're just waiting [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6800.32s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly what the delays are [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6803.32s)]
*  And just what kind of [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6806.32s)]
*  Whether we understand that the families could be there [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6809.32s)]
*  This could be because of the family reunions understandably [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6812.32s)]
*  These are the most precious moments when the families [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6815.32s)]
*  See their loved ones that they thought they would never see [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6818.32s)]
*  Whether some may need some immediate medical attention [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6821.32s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of thought that could be happening [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6824.32s)]
*  Now that the Israeli defense forces say that they [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6827.32s)]
*  Do have the three hostages [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6830.32s)]
*  They are out of captivity [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6833.32s)]
*  They have taken those first steps [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6836.32s)]
*  Let's now [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6839.32s)]
*  We're going to keep an eye on these pictures [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6842.32s)]
*  But let's cross over to Charleston where the US President [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6845.32s)]
*  Joe Biden is speaking [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6848.32s)]
*  Hundreds of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6851.32s)]
*  They're carrying assistance for civilians who suffered [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6854.32s)]
*  Enormously from the war that Hamas started [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6857.32s)]
*  On October 7, 2023, nearly 15 months ago [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6860.32s)]
*  Today alone we anticipate several hundred [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6863.32s)]
*  Trucks will enter the Gaza Strip [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6866.32s)]
*  Probably as I'm speaking [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6869.32s)]
*  And after so much pain, destruction, loss of life [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6872.32s)]
*  Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6875.32s)]
*  I want to talk about a deal that I outlined for the world [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6878.32s)]
*  Back in May 31st, many of you covered it at the time [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6881.32s)]
*  I was endorsed overwhelmingly [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6884.32s)]
*  By folks around the world including the UN Security Council [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6887.32s)]
*  Who unanimously endorsed the deal [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6890.32s)]
*  And developed a coordination [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6893.32s)]
*  I developed a coordination with Egypt, Qatar and Israel [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6896.32s)]
*  I've worked in foreign policy for decades [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6899.32s)]
*  And this is one of the toughest negotiations I've been part of [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6902.32s)]
*  I want to say that all these negotiations will test [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6905.32s)]
*  That the road to this deal has been not easy at all [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6908.32s)]
*  And a long road [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6911.32s)]
*  But we've reached this point today because of the pressure [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6914.32s)]
*  Of Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6917.32s)]
*  Some said my policy of a firm support for Israel [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6920.32s)]
*  Was relentlessly pursuing diplomacy [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6923.32s)]
*  Risk drawing America into a wider war in the region [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6926.32s)]
*  I listened to those voices, many of whom I respected a great deal [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6929.32s)]
*  The course I was on would not have led us to the ceasefire [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6932.32s)]
*  We're seeing today [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6935.32s)]
*  But instead it would have risked a wider war in the region [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6938.32s)]
*  That so many feared [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6941.32s)]
*  Now the region has been fundamentally transformed [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6944.32s)]
*  Hamas' long-time leader Sinemar is dead [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6947.32s)]
*  Hamas' sponsors in the Middle East have been badly weakened by Israel [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6950.32s)]
*  Backed by the United States [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6953.32s)]
*  Hezbollah, one of Hamas' biggest backers [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6956.32s)]
*  Israel's campaign was extremely successful [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6959.32s)]
*  So much so that by the end of November the United States [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6962.32s)]
*  Had brokered a ceasefire in Lebanon [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6965.32s)]
*  Hezbollah did what it said it would do [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6968.32s)]
*  It was to stop the ceasefire in Lebanon [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6971.32s)]
*  And to stop the ceasefire in the Middle East [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6974.32s)]
*  And to stop the ceasefire in the Middle East [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6977.32s)]
*  And to stop the ceasefire in the Middle East [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6980.32s)]
*  And to stop the ceasefire in the Middle East [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6983.32s)]
*  The ceasefire in Lebanon, Hezbollah did what it said it would never do [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6986.32s)]
*  It cut its deal and abandoned Hamas [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6989.32s)]
*  It cut its deal and abandoned Hamas [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6992.32s)]
*  And today in Lebanon [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6995.32s)]
*  There's finally a new president and prime minister [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=6998.32s)]
*  Both of whom support a sovereign Lebanon [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7001.32s)]
*  Without Hezbollah running the show or playing any part in it [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7004.32s)]
*  The Assad regime next door in Syria is gone [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7007.32s)]
*  Removing Iran's ready access to Lebanon [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7010.32s)]
*  Iran is in the weakest position in decades [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7013.32s)]
*  After the US military helped defend Israel [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7016.32s)]
*  From Iranian missiles and supported Israel's military response inside Iran [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7019.32s)]
*  Just look across the region [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7022.32s)]
*  In Lebanon there's an opportunity for a future [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7025.32s)]
*  Free from the grip of Hezbollah [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7028.32s)]
*  In Syria a future free from the Assad [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7031.32s)]
*  The tyranny of Assad [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7034.32s)]
*  For the Palestinian people a credible path to a state of their own [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7037.32s)]
*  And for the region and the future normalization [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7040.32s)]
*  And integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbors [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7043.32s)]
*  Including Saudi Arabia, with whom I've spoken with [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7046.32s)]
*  You know we've had many difficult days since Hamas began this terrible war [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7049.32s)]
*  We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7052.32s)]
*  But we haven't given up [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7055.32s)]
*  And a special thanks to my team, particularly Brett McGurk, who many of you know [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7058.32s)]
*  Who spent weeks and months working nonstop to reach this deal [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7061.32s)]
*  Many of those weeks and months out of the country [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7064.32s)]
*  Today ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7067.32s)]
*  Is a result of a principled and effective policy [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7070.32s)]
*  That we presided over for months [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7073.32s)]
*  And we got here without a wider war in the Middle East [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7076.32s)]
*  That many predicted [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7079.32s)]
*  And now it falls on the next administration to help implement this deal [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7082.32s)]
*  I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7085.32s)]
*  It was both necessary and effective and unprecedented [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7088.32s)]
*  But success is going to require persistence [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7091.32s)]
*  And continuing support for our friends in the region [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7094.32s)]
*  And the belief in diplomacy backed by deterrence [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7097.32s)]
*  So as we reflect on the news from Gaza today [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7100.32s)]
*  We also remember all the victims of this war [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7103.32s)]
*  They were mindful [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7106.32s)]
*  They were mindful that the pursuit of a lasting peace [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7109.32s)]
*  While never easy or quick must always be our calling [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7112.32s)]
*  So thank you all for listening [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7115.32s)]
*  May God bless you all, may God protect our troops from looking forward [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7118.32s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm not going to take any questions now [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7121.32s)]
*  There's a whole congregation waiting for me [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7124.32s)]
*  And I'm sure the remainder of the day I'll have an opportunity to speak with you [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7127.32s)]
*  Thank you very much [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7130.32s)]
*  Joe Biden speaking there live in Charleston [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7133.32s)]
*  On his final day [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7136.32s)]
*  Don't forget as US President Donald Trump taking over [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7139.32s)]
*  And being inaugurated tomorrow [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7142.32s)]
*  He was talking about the process of the end of the war [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7145.32s)]
*  And speaking of this point [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7148.32s)]
*  Live pictures again that you're seeing on your screen [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7151.32s)]
*  Of Reim in southern Israel [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7154.32s)]
*  You can see the camera keeps moving around [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7157.32s)]
*  Because it's looking for the points of action [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7160.32s)]
*  So we saw even as Joe Biden was speaking [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7163.32s)]
*  We were bringing you those live pictures of the vehicles [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7166.32s)]
*  With the red and blue flashing lights [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7169.32s)]
*  Moving towards the edge of the helipad now [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7172.32s)]
*  You can see those Israeli Air Force helicopters [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7175.32s)]
*  Waiting to collect the hostages [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7178.32s)]
*  And to take them to Sheba Hospital [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7181.32s)]
*  Where our correspondent Jonah Fisher [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7184.32s)]
*  Is watching proceedings there as well [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7187.32s)]
*  You can also see the scene here in Hostages Square [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7190.32s)]
*  In Tel Aviv [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7193.32s)]
*  And while Joe Biden was speaking there [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7196.32s)]
*  You were listening to Joe Biden speaking in Charleston [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7199.32s)]
*  The last thing that people here [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7202.32s)]
*  That you can see there in Hostages Square [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7205.32s)]
*  Have been listening to is the latest update [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7208.32s)]
*  From the Israel Defence Forces [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7211.32s)]
*  From Rear Admiral Daniel Higary [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7214.32s)]
*  Who was also speaking live [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7217.32s)]
*  They're watching and listening on the big screen here [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7220.32s)]
*  Let me just tell you a little bit of what he has been saying [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7223.32s)]
*  He said that the hostages are going to meet their families soon [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7226.32s)]
*  And he has asked people not to spread fake news [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7229.32s)]
*  About what is unfolding just now [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7232.32s)]
*  He said our hearts are with the rest of the hostages [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7235.32s)]
*  Of course this is three Israeli hostages being released today [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7238.32s)]
*  Three of 33 will be released over the next six weeks [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7241.32s)]
*  But there are some yet who don't know [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7244.32s)]
*  A date at which they will be able to come home [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7247.32s)]
*  He also was talking about Hamas [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7250.32s)]
*  And particularly about that delay [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7253.32s)]
*  That we saw this morning [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7256.32s)]
*  Where the ceasefire was supposed to start at 8.30 [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7259.32s)]
*  It was delayed, didn't happen until quarter past 11 this morning [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7262.32s)]
*  Rear Admiral Daniel Higary is saying that Hamas [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7265.32s)]
*  Must respect the timelines in the next days of the ceasefire [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7268.32s)]
*  Today he says they didn't [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7271.32s)]
*  Then circling round to talk once again about the hostages [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7274.32s)]
*  He says the three are protected [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7277.32s)]
*  They will meet their mothers soon in minutes [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7280.32s)]
*  He also was addressing the 33 [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7283.32s)]
*  We don't know for sure the identities of the 33 [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7286.32s)]
*  We do have three of them [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7289.32s)]
*  But there are still 30 hostages due to be released in the next six weeks [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7292.32s)]
*  Whose identities we don't know for sure [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7295.32s)]
*  But the belief is that [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7298.32s)]
*  Not all of those 30 are alive [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7301.32s)]
*  The expression they have used before now [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7304.32s)]
*  Is that most of them are believed to be alive [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7307.32s)]
*  Rear Admiral Daniel Higary is saying [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7310.32s)]
*  How many of the 33 are alive? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7313.32s)]
*  Many, we will not give a number [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7316.32s)]
*  That was the latest update from the IDF [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7319.32s)]
*  The Israel Defence Force is being listened to intently [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7322.32s)]
*  By people here in the square [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7325.32s)]
*  As we continue to watch these live pictures [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7328.32s)]
*  Really these pictures not just being watched here in Israel [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7331.32s)]
*  But watched around the world [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7334.32s)]
*  And the Israeli Defence Force continues to return these hostages back to their families [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7337.32s)]
*  President Joe Biden was speaking on his last day [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7350.32s)]
*  As President of the United States of America [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7353.32s)]
*  And Commander in Chief we had that statement [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7356.32s)]
*  By the Israeli Defence Forces [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7359.32s)]
*  Saying that the three hostages [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7362.32s)]
*  Are currently on their way [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7365.32s)]
*  This came out a few minutes ago [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7368.32s)]
*  To an initial reception point in southern Israel [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7371.32s)]
*  Where they will undergo an initial medical assessment [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7374.32s)]
*  And as we have been mentioning [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7377.32s)]
*  Two of the hostages were known to have been injured [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7380.32s)]
*  When they were seized at gunpoint [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7383.32s)]
*  In southern Israel [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7386.32s)]
*  On that dreadful day of October 7 [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7389.32s)]
*  We have no idea [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7392.32s)]
*  Although there will be information [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7395.32s)]
*  Judging by how the other releases have been managed [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7398.32s)]
*  Information will be given at some point [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7401.32s)]
*  Including by the hostages themselves about their ordeal [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7404.32s)]
*  But they are said to be on their way [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7407.32s)]
*  They may now be in that place [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7410.32s)]
*  In Reim, in the Skibutz in southern Israel [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7413.32s)]
*  For an initial medical assessment [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7416.32s)]
*  We have family members there [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7419.32s)]
*  But we have to wait and get confirmation of that [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7422.32s)]
*  To remind you again [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7425.32s)]
*  Three Israeli hostages, Conan Romy, 24 years old [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7428.32s)]
*  Emily Demary, 28 years old [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7431.32s)]
*  Doron Steinbacher, who is 31 years old [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7434.32s)]
*  The first three to be released [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7437.32s)]
*  In this hard fought deal [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7440.32s)]
*  To bring the hostages home [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7443.32s)]
*  Bright lights there, Anna [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7446.32s)]
*  As you say, the cameras are searching [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7449.32s)]
*  Trying to keep an eye on that moment [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7452.32s)]
*  To see when the helicopters lift off [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7455.32s)]
*  It's hard to see now exactly what's happening in the dark there [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7458.32s)]
*  Literally everyone is staring in the darkness [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7461.32s)]
*  But confirmation that the darkness for these three women [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7464.32s)]
*  Has now ended [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7467.32s)]
*  They are now safely in Israel [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7470.32s)]
*  The hostages are now in the hospital [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7473.32s)]
*  In the hospital in the city of Reim [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7476.32s)]
*  They will be taken to the hospital in Reim [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7479.32s)]
*  And will be taken for more specialised care [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7482.32s)]
*  To the Shiba hospital in Tel Aviv [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7485.32s)]
*  In Tel Aviv today [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7488.32s)]
*  From some of those hostage families [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7491.32s)]
*  Because as I was describing earlier [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7494.32s)]
*  This is a place that people, they gravitate towards [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7497.32s)]
*  They will be walking through this square [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7500.32s)]
*  They will be looking at the names, looking at the images [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7503.32s)]
*  But hostage families come here as well [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7506.32s)]
*  Many of them want to talk about the ordeal [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7509.32s)]
*  That they have been through [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7512.32s)]
*  They want to keep the names, the faces, the stories [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7515.32s)]
*  The identities of their loved ones in the public eye [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7518.32s)]
*  Because for many of them they firmly, strongly believe [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7521.32s)]
*  That that helps contribute to the international pressure [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7524.32s)]
*  So we have been meeting and speaking [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7527.32s)]
*  To various people today [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7530.32s)]
*  To mothers, to cousins, to brothers [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7533.32s)]
*  Who, they come here for comfort [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7536.32s)]
*  I think they come here for solace sometimes [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7539.32s)]
*  But they also come here to tell their stories [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7542.32s)]
*  And to hope that their loved ones [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7545.32s)]
*  Will be part of this release at some point [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7548.32s)]
*  Now 33 hostages [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7551.32s)]
*  Are being released in phase one [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7554.32s)]
*  Of this agreement [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7557.32s)]
*  Specific groups of people [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7560.32s)]
*  Women, female soldiers this time round as well [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7563.32s)]
*  Male soldiers are not included in this particular group [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7566.32s)]
*  They will be released at a later stage if the ceasefire holds [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7569.32s)]
*  People who need medical attention and care [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7572.32s)]
*  The elderly, which is described in this case [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7575.32s)]
*  As men over the age of 50 [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7578.32s)]
*  There are families that have been in circulation [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7581.32s)]
*  It hasn't been confirmed, but it is in circulation [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7584.32s)]
*  So there are families who [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7587.32s)]
*  Are in a position where they can have a pretty strong belief [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7590.32s)]
*  That in the next six weeks if things go to plan [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7593.32s)]
*  They will see their loved ones [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7596.32s)]
*  But one of the most difficult blows as we were hearing [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7599.32s)]
*  From Rear Admiral Daniel Higary from the Israel Defense Forces [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7602.32s)]
*  Is that Israeli authorities do not know for sure [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7605.32s)]
*  Which of those 33 are alive or dead [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7608.32s)]
*  They say that they believe that many [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7611.32s)]
*  Most are alive [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7614.32s)]
*  But I think there is also an expectation [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7617.32s)]
*  That even in the next six weeks, even in the first phase of this deal [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7620.32s)]
*  At some point one of these moments of release [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7623.32s)]
*  Will involve the handover [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7626.32s)]
*  Not of live hostages [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7629.32s)]
*  But of the bodies of hostages [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7632.32s)]
*  That is something that we will wait and watch [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7635.32s)]
*  As phase one of this deal [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7638.32s)]
*  Moves through as people hope it will move into phase two [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7641.32s)]
*  Into phase three with an eventual end to the war [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7644.32s)]
*  And an eventual reconstruction of Gaza [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7647.32s)]
*  We're still showing you these live pictures [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7650.32s)]
*  Here of Reim in southern Israel [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7653.32s)]
*  You can see the various vehicles [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7656.32s)]
*  Moving about there [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7659.32s)]
*  We know that this is where the women have been taken to [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7662.32s)]
*  That's the sort of focus of the action at the moment [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7665.32s)]
*  Before they are then moved to hospital [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7668.32s)]
*  Where they will be cared for [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7671.32s)]
*  And they will spend an individual amount of time [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7674.32s)]
*  In medical care [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7677.32s)]
*  I remember speaking here in this square actually [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7680.32s)]
*  At the time of the last hostage release [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7683.32s)]
*  To one of the medical staff, one of the doctors [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7686.32s)]
*  And he was really fascinating [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7689.32s)]
*  Just giving an insight into [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7692.32s)]
*  What people face when they come out [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7695.32s)]
*  In some cases, he says if they've been held underground in tunnels [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7698.32s)]
*  It's had an impact on things like their eyesight for example [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7701.32s)]
*  You know, people's strength [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7704.32s)]
*  People's physical strength [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7707.32s)]
*  People's levels of nourishment [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7710.32s)]
*  People's levels of energy [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7713.32s)]
*  And also on the mental health side [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7716.32s)]
*  So much to consider as well [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7719.32s)]
*  And one thing which I remember was particularly striking at the time [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7722.32s)]
*  He said that when hostages are released [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7725.32s)]
*  They come out to a world that suddenly [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7728.32s)]
*  Knows their name, knows their face [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7731.32s)]
*  And people are desperate to see them [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7734.32s)]
*  They couldn't possibly walk down the street without being recognised [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7737.32s)]
*  Without people coming up to them [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7740.32s)]
*  And at the end of a gruelling ordeal in captivity [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7743.32s)]
*  That is often something that people don't want [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7746.32s)]
*  They would find very, very hard to handle [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7749.32s)]
*  So there are lots of different things that are put in place [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7752.32s)]
*  Both for the mental and physical health of those hostages [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7755.32s)]
*  And as we continue to watch these live pictures, Lise [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7758.32s)]
*  That will be something [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7761.32s)]
*  That we will start to see in the next couple of hours [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7764.32s)]
*  Particularly when they're taken to hospital [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7767.32s)]
*  And the process towards rehabilitation [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7770.32s)]
*  Will start to happen [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7773.32s)]
*  Yes, there's intense [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7776.32s)]
*  Personal moments which they have to share [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7779.32s)]
*  With the world and while we've been on air, Anna [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7782.32s)]
*  The IDF has now released footage of [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7785.32s)]
*  Three mothers sitting [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7788.32s)]
*  In the reception centre in Riem [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7791.32s)]
*  We're seeing the pictures outside, but they're there somewhere [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7794.32s)]
*  The IDF's director is sitting with them [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7797.32s)]
*  And showing them images [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7800.32s)]
*  Of their daughters [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7803.32s)]
*  As they are being released [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7806.32s)]
*  He's kind of pointing to, I'm sure we'll get these images [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7809.32s)]
*  And be able to share them with you on BBC News [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7812.32s)]
*  Of the three mothers sitting together [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7815.32s)]
*  And they're watching the images [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7818.32s)]
*  That are being shared with the IDF [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7821.32s)]
*  This is confirming then that the mothers are there [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7824.32s)]
*  These images were released [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7827.32s)]
*  A short time ago [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7830.32s)]
*  They may have had the reunion already, but they too [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7833.32s)]
*  Are there in the reception [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7836.32s)]
*  So yes, the IDF spokesman, Hargary [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7839.32s)]
*  He confirmed, within minutes the hostages are going to meet their mothers [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7842.32s)]
*  At the reception centres and they'll undergo [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7845.32s)]
*  Initial medical checks [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7848.32s)]
*  And then later they will travel by helicopter [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7851.32s)]
*  To the hospital to be reunited [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7854.32s)]
*  To get medical checks [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7857.32s)]
*  And also they'll be reunited with the rest of their families [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7860.32s)]
*  Everything, Anna has to be so carefully choreographed [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7863.32s)]
*  Because you can imagine if [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7866.32s)]
*  We just don't know, but many of them will have been in confinement [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7869.32s)]
*  They'll have been living underground [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7872.32s)]
*  They will have lived with no certainty that they would ever [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7875.32s)]
*  See their families again [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7878.32s)]
*  So they want to just keep, to minimise [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7881.32s)]
*  The kind of pressures on the hostages [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7884.32s)]
*  As they return to their old lives [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7887.32s)]
*  And judging by these images and these released photographs [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7890.32s)]
*  It's the mothers, the three mothers [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7893.32s)]
*  Of these three women who they may now have met [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7896.32s)]
*  Their daughters [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7899.32s)]
*  And then after about an hour and then some medical checks [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7902.32s)]
*  And then they will then be reunited [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7905.32s)]
*  With the rest of their families [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7908.32s)]
*  You can imagine an emotional rollercoaster [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7911.32s)]
*  For the three hostages emerging literally into the light [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7914.32s)]
*  Into their old lives [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7917.32s)]
*  Lives again, so it may be [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7920.32s)]
*  This is confirmation Anna, it will be at least an hour [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7923.32s)]
*  We just received this statement from the [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7926.32s)]
*  IDF spokesman, Daniel Hargary [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7929.32s)]
*  And he said that [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7932.32s)]
*  They're in safe hands and that seems to be [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7935.32s)]
*  More details about exactly what we're expecting to see [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7938.32s)]
*  In the next hour or so [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7941.32s)]
*  As the first steps [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7944.32s)]
*  In the new chapter of three hostages' lives [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7947.32s)]
*  They're no longer hostages, they're ex-hostages [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7950.32s)]
*  But their hostage ordeal will [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7953.32s)]
*  Dominate their lives [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7956.32s)]
*  For some time to come [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7959.32s)]
*  At least we've got some fresh pictures [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7965.32s)]
*  That we can show you now [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7968.32s)]
*  These are pictures from inside Gaza [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7971.32s)]
*  Of the moment that these three women [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7974.32s)]
*  Were handed over [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7977.32s)]
*  New pictures, you can see the huge crowds there [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7980.32s)]
*  Around the Red Cross vehicles, you can see [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7983.32s)]
*  The green headbands there, you can see the faces [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7986.32s)]
*  Covered, you can see the weapons in the air [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7989.32s)]
*  And what you can see, just make out in that crowd [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7992.32s)]
*  Is the three women being handed over [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7995.32s)]
*  And being transferred into the vehicle [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=7998.32s)]
*  It's a slightly clearer picture than we were seeing earlier [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8001.32s)]
*  It is basically the pictures that were being [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8004.32s)]
*  Shown in the square here, and you can see [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8007.32s)]
*  Those vehicles pressing through those crowds [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8010.32s)]
*  You can see people going right up to the windows [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8013.32s)]
*  Of the vehicles with mobile phones [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8016.32s)]
*  Filming, you can see there [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8019.32s)]
*  In the high visibility vest, the member there [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8022.32s)]
*  Of the Red Cross, because that is how these things happen [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8025.32s)]
*  That is the choreography of these moments [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8028.32s)]
*  Where Hamas [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8031.32s)]
*  Hand the hostages over to the Red Cross [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8034.32s)]
*  Which we saw those new pictures just there [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8037.32s)]
*  What we now know is that those three hostages [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8040.32s)]
*  Are now in the hands of the Israeli military [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8043.32s)]
*  They are very soon to be [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8046.32s)]
*  If not already, reunited [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8049.32s)]
*  With their families, with their mothers [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8052.32s)]
*  Who have been waiting for this moment [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8055.32s)]
*  For 470 days, 15 months [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8058.32s)]
*  Of devastating war in Gaza [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8061.32s)]
*  Of the devastating impact here in Israel [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8064.32s)]
*  Of the events of October the 7th [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8067.32s)]
*  And we see today, for three families at least [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8070.32s)]
*  A brief moment of joy [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8073.32s)]
*  In the center of that, just showing you these pictures again [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8076.32s)]
*  Just so you can get a closer look of that [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8079.32s)]
*  That moment of handover in Gaza [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8082.32s)]
*  We've been showing you live pictures [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8085.32s)]
*  And we'll continue to show you live pictures [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8088.32s)]
*  Of the scene in southern Israel, where they've been received [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8091.32s)]
*  And where they'll soon be flown by helicopter to Sheba Hospital [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8094.32s)]
*  Just in the suburbs here in Tel Aviv [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8097.32s)]
*  At least I know at some point we will also see [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8100.32s)]
*  As we did the last time there was a ceasefire [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8103.32s)]
*  Images of those very emotional reunions [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8106.32s)]
*  You know, cameras in general are not allowed in [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8109.32s)]
*  But what tends to happen is the Israeli government [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8112.32s)]
*  The government press office tends to film these moments [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8115.32s)]
*  And then circulate them around [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8118.32s)]
*  And we saw, didn't we last time round, some really [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8121.32s)]
*  Extremely emotional moments [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8124.32s)]
*  Where parents and children, because last time [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8127.32s)]
*  Children were released, parents and children being brought back together [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8130.32s)]
*  Once again, so I would expect [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8133.32s)]
*  If not in the coming hours, then certainly in the next day or two [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8136.32s)]
*  That images of those reunions [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8139.32s)]
*  Will also start to fill our screens, Lise, as well [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8142.32s)]
*  This is an extraordinary footage [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8145.32s)]
*  That we've just shown, Anna [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8148.32s)]
*  It was hard to make out where the three women hostages were [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8151.32s)]
*  There was that crush of Hamas fighters [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8154.32s)]
*  With their weapons in the air [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8157.32s)]
*  With their green bandanas [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8160.32s)]
*  That is certain to provoke comment and criticism [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8163.32s)]
*  In Israel that 15 months after [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8166.32s)]
*  A punishing war where Israeli bombardment [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8169.32s)]
*  Has gone on night and day [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8172.32s)]
*  Operations on the ground, operations from the air and still [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8175.32s)]
*  Hamas, this is clearly sending a signal [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8178.32s)]
*  From Hamas that they are not defeated [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8181.32s)]
*  Even after all that [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8184.32s)]
*  They can mount a show of strength [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8187.32s)]
*  A show of strength to Israel, to its rivals [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8190.32s)]
*  That there's still very much a presence there [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8193.32s)]
*  Even though, of course, Israel has been categorical [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8196.32s)]
*  That Hamas will not be allowed to rule the Gaza Strip [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8199.32s)]
*  But there you see today with their green bandanas [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8202.32s)]
*  This moment where they really want it [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8205.32s)]
*  This is not something beyond the gaze of the cameras [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8208.32s)]
*  A discreet handover [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8211.32s)]
*  There you see the red vests of the International Committee [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8214.32s)]
*  Of the Red Cross trying as they might [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8217.32s)]
*  To maintain the dignity of this moment [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8220.32s)]
*  They've been thrown into this process as well [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8223.32s)]
*  Being the ones with their special responsibilities [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8226.32s)]
*  Under the Geneva Conventions to care for prisoners [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8229.32s)]
*  When they're held in captivity as they're released [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8232.32s)]
*  And then being released from the hands [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8235.32s)]
*  Of the Hamas fighters [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8238.32s)]
*  Of course we heard from the Qatari government [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8241.32s)]
*  Spokesperson earlier in the day saying that Hamas [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8244.32s)]
*  Is committed to this deal that the mediators [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8247.32s)]
*  The Qatari government are committed to [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8250.32s)]
*  And that Hamas is committed to this deal that the mediators [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8253.32s)]
*  The Qatari, the Egyptians, the Americans [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8256.32s)]
*  Will be working in concert from their coordination office [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8259.32s)]
*  Which has been set up in Cairo [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8262.32s)]
*  They'll also have a presence on the ground in Gaza Strip [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8265.32s)]
*  To do everything possible to ensure that both sides [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8268.32s)]
*  Adhere to the terms of this three-part process [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8271.32s)]
*  Which we're seeing unfolding now in its first hours [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8274.32s)]
*  The first humanitarian phase [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8277.32s)]
*  We've seen these three hostages come home [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8280.32s)]
*  And we should see shortly, Anna, that the prisoners [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8283.32s)]
*  As well will be released from Ofer prison [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8286.32s)]
*  The live shots we were showing earlier [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8289.32s)]
*  With Palestinians there waiting outside [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8292.32s)]
*  To welcome their loved ones home [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8295.32s)]
*  Israel had said it wouldn't allow scenes of celebration [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8298.32s)]
*  But we saw the first time around [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8301.32s)]
*  That Palestinians didn't listen to those warnings [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8304.32s)]
*  And the second time around that Palestinians too [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8307.32s)]
*  Are overwhelmed by emotion to see their loved ones [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8310.32s)]
*  Emerge from the prison [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8313.32s)]
*  We're looking again at the scene from Reem [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8316.32s)]
*  Where we now know that the mothers are there [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8319.32s)]
*  Three mothers, the medical teams are there [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8322.32s)]
*  And after the reunion there'll be a medical inspection [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8325.32s)]
*  Which the Israeli Defence Forces say should take about an hour [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8328.32s)]
*  And then they will be taken by helicopter [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8331.32s)]
*  We've seen the helicopter on that tarmac for many hours now [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8334.32s)]
*  And they will take them to the Sheba medical facility [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8337.32s)]
*  At least we've been talking about the impact [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8346.32s)]
*  On hostage families [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8349.32s)]
*  Not just the families of those three women [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8352.32s)]
*  Who are being released today, but also those families [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8355.32s)]
*  Who are still waiting [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8358.32s)]
*  Now, Adam's cousin, Saki Edan [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8361.32s)]
*  Was taken on the 7th of October [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8364.32s)]
*  Adam, thank you for joining us here on BBC News [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8367.32s)]
*  Good afternoon, Ina, how are you? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8370.32s)]
*  I'm well, thank you for asking [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8376.32s)]
*  I want to say actually upfront, yours is a story that I know very well [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8379.32s)]
*  Because in the days after the 7th of October [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8382.32s)]
*  I met and spoke to Gali [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8385.32s)]
*  And to Saki's wife [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8388.32s)]
*  And to the family [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8391.32s)]
*  I was present at Maayan's funeral [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8394.32s)]
*  Maayan, just 18 years old, who was killed by Hamas that day [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8397.32s)]
*  Your story [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8400.32s)]
*  And your family's story [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8403.32s)]
*  Has been one of incredible difficulty [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8406.32s)]
*  And also incredible strength and bravery [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8409.32s)]
*  In the case of Gali and what she's been through [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8412.32s)]
*  How are you and they now [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8415.32s)]
*  At this point where [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8418.32s)]
*  There is a chance that in the next six weeks [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8421.32s)]
*  Saki will be released? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8424.32s)]
*  As you can imagine, Ina, all the hostage families [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8427.32s)]
*  Including my own are completely on tenterhooks [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8430.32s)]
*  They're feeling the full spectrum of human emotion [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8433.32s)]
*  I think there are emotions that we're feeling [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8436.32s)]
*  That I don't think have an English word for [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8439.32s)]
*  A huge amount [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8442.32s)]
*  Our fates are really intertwined with one another [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8445.32s)]
*  As hostage families [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8448.32s)]
*  And so to see those scenes of Doron and Emily [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8451.32s)]
*  And Womie being, you know, walking on their own two legs [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8454.32s)]
*  Their own two feet out of the car [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8457.32s)]
*  Knowing that they're at least alive and well [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8460.32s)]
*  Enough to do that [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8463.32s)]
*  And to be back on Israeli soil, to be in Israeli care [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8466.32s)]
*  And to be reunited with their loved ones, their family [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8469.32s)]
*  Their mothers especially [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8472.32s)]
*  I was with Mandy in 10 Downing Street a few months ago [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8475.32s)]
*  An incredible human being [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8478.32s)]
*  Just one of the most awful times [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8481.32s)]
*  For all parents [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8484.32s)]
*  To see, to have to not know what's happening [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8487.32s)]
*  With their children [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8490.32s)]
*  And so you can imagine what they must be going through right now [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8493.32s)]
*  And so we as families are feeling that joy too [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8496.32s)]
*  By proxy [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8499.32s)]
*  We are completely attached [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8502.32s)]
*  And for all the hostage families I think it's fair to say [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8505.32s)]
*  We feel as one big family [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8508.32s)]
*  So when any of us are returned, we share in their joy [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8511.32s)]
*  And we celebrate [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8514.32s)]
*  At the same time we're also aware that our loved ones haven't been returned to us [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8517.32s)]
*  And that anxiety continues [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8520.32s)]
*  And so we're seeing that the hostages are being restructured [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8523.32s)]
*  And also seeing those scenes [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8526.32s)]
*  You saw the way the chaos [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8529.32s)]
*  The sort of PR coup that Hamas [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8532.32s)]
*  Are trying to extract from these releases [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8535.32s)]
*  And also by staggering them out in this way [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8538.32s)]
*  It really is adding to the torment of the hostage families [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8541.32s)]
*  There is an element of psychological warfare happening here [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8544.32s)]
*  And so it's very distressing at the same time to see that [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8547.32s)]
*  For 15 months in appalling conditions [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8550.32s)]
*  And for these scenes to be there [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8553.32s)]
*  You know, moment when they're reunited [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8556.32s)]
*  It's very distressing to see it [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8559.32s)]
*  I'm very distressed for them [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8562.32s)]
*  And I'm very worried and anxious about the future [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8565.32s)]
*  And what that means for the rest of the hostages [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8568.32s)]
*  As you mentioned in your reporting [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8571.32s)]
*  We don't know who among the hostages are alive or dead [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8574.32s)]
*  We don't know if my cousin Tzachi is alive or dead [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8577.32s)]
*  We have no proof of life [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8580.32s)]
*  Even though we see cars from the International Red Cross [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8583.32s)]
*  They have not visited the hostages [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8586.32s)]
*  It's still in captivity [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8589.32s)]
*  And so we don't have any assurances from any source [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8592.32s)]
*  Be it the Red Cross, the Israeli government, Qatar [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8595.32s)]
*  Whoever is involved [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8598.32s)]
*  That the remaining hostages are well [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8601.32s)]
*  We're going to be weeks of this kind of torment [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8604.32s)]
*  This psychological warfare [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8607.32s)]
*  The full spectrum of emotions [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8610.32s)]
*  We celebrate this day, of course [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8613.32s)]
*  And this is the dream [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8616.32s)]
*  We want to see all our loved ones return to us as soon as humanly possible [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8619.32s)]
*  And I'm also watching the video clips [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8622.32s)]
*  Of all of the friends of the returned hostages today [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8625.32s)]
*  Of Emily, Doron and Wormy [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8628.32s)]
*  And I'm also watching the video clips of the friends [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8631.32s)]
*  Celebrating when they finally saw images of them alive [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8634.32s)]
*  And coming out of the transport [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8637.32s)]
*  I couldn't help but cry [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8640.32s)]
*  I couldn't help but cry tears of joy [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8643.32s)]
*  And celebrate with them [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8646.32s)]
*  And I think we should treasure that for the moment [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8649.32s)]
*  And hold on to that and hope that that happens for the rest of us as well [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8652.32s)]
*  Of course, one of the delays [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8655.32s)]
*  That was coming into effect this morning was the fact that Hamas were slow [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8658.32s)]
*  Slower than they should have been under the terms of the agreement [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8661.32s)]
*  To release the names of those three [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8664.32s)]
*  Now, Saki has turned 50 while in captivity [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8667.32s)]
*  So that now puts him into one of the [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8670.32s)]
*  Eligible groups to be released [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8673.32s)]
*  In the next six weeks under the first phase of this [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8676.32s)]
*  In terms of news about him [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8679.32s)]
*  About his condition [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8682.32s)]
*  What have the family heard? [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8685.32s)]
*  And I mean we've had [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8688.32s)]
*  Only the official notification by the Israeli government [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8691.32s)]
*  That Saki is indeed on the list of first [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8694.32s)]
*  Of the phase one part of this deal [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8697.32s)]
*  But we have no confirmation of his well-being [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8700.32s)]
*  His health, his status, we don't know if he's alive or dead [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8703.32s)]
*  And to compound that problem, as you know [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8706.32s)]
*  When he was taken [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8709.32s)]
*  The last trauma that he endured [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8712.32s)]
*  Was to see his firstborn daughter murdered [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8715.32s)]
*  In front of him and die in his arms [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8718.32s)]
*  And so there's a slight worry that during this time [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8721.32s)]
*  During his time in captivity he may himself [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8724.32s)]
*  Feel possibly [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8727.32s)]
*  That the rest of his family didn't survive [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8730.32s)]
*  We don't know if he knows that his children [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8733.32s)]
*  His remaining children and his wife Gali are alive [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8736.32s)]
*  And so I'm also just deeply concerned and anxious [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8739.32s)]
*  For what he knows and what he's expecting to come back to [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8742.32s)]
*  In this whole deal [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8745.32s)]
*  And so there's just so much [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8748.32s)]
*  Royaling emotions going on at the same time [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8751.32s)]
*  Anxiety and joy, fear [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8754.32s)]
*  Guarded optimism, hope [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8757.32s)]
*  Just anger [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8760.32s)]
*  That has taken so long [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8763.32s)]
*  Frustration at not knowing [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8766.32s)]
*  There's still so many details of this [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8769.32s)]
*  The devil is really in the details of this deal [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8772.32s)]
*  And the devil right now is taunting us [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8775.32s)]
*  When you [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8781.32s)]
*  When you experience moments like this [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8784.32s)]
*  We had a ceasefire before, we had hostage releases before [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8787.32s)]
*  Well over a year ago now [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8790.32s)]
*  And you're talking there about the range of emotions [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8793.32s)]
*  That it brings, the fact that these are now your friends [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8796.32s)]
*  These are people that you have drawn support and strength from [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8799.32s)]
*  I've been really struck actually [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8802.32s)]
*  Throughout this process at the way that the [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8805.32s)]
*  Hostage families have worked together [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8808.32s)]
*  As a group, as a team [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8811.32s)]
*  It's quite an extraordinary thing [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8814.32s)]
*  And I think that we've really found [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8817.32s)]
*  An example of community and solidarity [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8820.32s)]
*  And has been so critically important [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8823.32s)]
*  For the families to have one another [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8826.32s)]
*  We've all going through similar [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8829.32s)]
*  Crisis and to have one another to lean onto [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8832.32s)]
*  And support and also the wider family [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8835.32s)]
*  Networks that we've created [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8838.32s)]
*  You know just the other day I had our neighbour Omri Miran [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8841.32s)]
*  Who was also taken hostage with Zahi [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8844.32s)]
*  His brother-in-law was here in London [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8847.32s)]
*  And we've become like brothers ourselves [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8850.32s)]
*  I saw him when I went to the UN General Assembly meeting earlier in the year [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8853.32s)]
*  And he lives in New York and he's now been in London [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8856.32s)]
*  And we share in each other's pain [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8859.32s)]
*  And we prop each other up and we make each other laugh [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8862.32s)]
*  And we find the strength to keep going [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8865.32s)]
*  With Omri's case I think again another issue [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8868.32s)]
*  A sort of tragic element of all this is that [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8871.32s)]
*  Omri and Zahi, two fathers, Omri has two small children [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8874.32s)]
*  Ages one and three and a loving wife [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8877.32s)]
*  Zahi has three children, remaining children and a loving wife [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8880.32s)]
*  The difference between them is only a few years [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8883.32s)]
*  And so Zahi because he turned 50 [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8886.32s)]
*  In April last year he gets to be in phase one [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8889.32s)]
*  But Omri who was taken at the same time as Zahi [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8892.32s)]
*  His family now have to suffer longer [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8895.32s)]
*  And in this ambiguous phase too [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8898.32s)]
*  With all these extra conditions that seem very tenuous [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8901.32s)]
*  And fraught with danger [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8904.32s)]
*  And I think I'm really concerned about all of the hostages [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8907.32s)]
*  Not just my own cousin [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8910.32s)]
*  And there are now 94 hostages still in captivity [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8913.32s)]
*  And I think all hostages families are united [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8916.32s)]
*  Even the ones who are having their loved ones return to them [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8919.32s)]
*  And they will continue to advocate for all of the hostages [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8922.32s)]
*  And they will continue to advocate for all 94 to be returned [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8925.32s)]
*  As swiftly as humanly possible [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8928.32s)]
*  Adam have you ever been to Hostages Square here in Tel Aviv [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8931.32s)]
*  The place I'm speaking to you from now [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8934.32s)]
*  Since October 7th I've not travelled to Israel [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8937.32s)]
*  I've been staying here and trying to advocate for my cousin from abroad [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8940.32s)]
*  But I'm intending to come as soon as humanly possible [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8943.32s)]
*  Once Zahi's returned [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8946.32s)]
*  The only issue I'm trying to do is to stay here [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8949.32s)]
*  So once Zahi's returned [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8952.32s)]
*  The only issue there Anna [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8955.32s)]
*  And again another sort of part of the anxiety we all feel [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8958.32s)]
*  Is that I don't know if I'll be coming to a funeral [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8961.32s)]
*  Or to a celebration and family reunion [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8964.32s)]
*  So it is a very [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8967.32s)]
*  Still a very tumultuous time for us [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8970.32s)]
*  And I will be there soon and I will be [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8973.32s)]
*  Embracing all of the families [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8976.32s)]
*  Who have become like family to me [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8979.32s)]
*  And sharing in their joy and in their pain [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8982.32s)]
*  And also I should say [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8985.32s)]
*  The mothers you mentioned were in [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8988.32s)]
*  The Reim is very near to the site of the Nova massacre [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8991.32s)]
*  And I've become very close with [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8994.32s)]
*  People like the Marlow family [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=8997.32s)]
*  Mike and Lisa whose son Jake was a British citizen [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9000.32s)]
*  Who went to Israel and he was working security at the Nova Festival [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9003.32s)]
*  And who was murdered on October 7th [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9006.32s)]
*  And so I also think about them and I think about [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9009.32s)]
*  The victims of October 7th who still have lost so much [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9012.32s)]
*  And they're rooting for our family [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9015.32s)]
*  They're rooting for all the families but we should also remember [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9018.32s)]
*  How much we've lost and the pain [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9021.32s)]
*  That those families are enduring and never forget [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9024.32s)]
*  What happened on October 7th [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9027.32s)]
*  Before I let you go Adam [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9030.32s)]
*  The reason I asked whether you'd been to this square [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9033.32s)]
*  Because if you hadn't I was going to describe to you [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9036.32s)]
*  Where I am just now, there are various tents [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9039.32s)]
*  Along the side of the square here [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9042.32s)]
*  And there is one of them that is very much dedicated [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9045.32s)]
*  To Saki and to Omri [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9048.32s)]
*  It's very close to where I am now [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9051.32s)]
*  And his picture is all over this tent [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9054.32s)]
*  There's a sign that celebrated his 50th birthday [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9057.32s)]
*  Really close to where I am standing just now [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9060.32s)]
*  And I remember being at a big family rally here [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9063.32s)]
*  Not too long afterwards [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9066.32s)]
*  Where Sharon was here [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9069.32s)]
*  Saki and Gali's second daughter [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9072.32s)]
*  Talking to her for the second time after I met her with Gali [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9075.32s)]
*  Just outside this tent here [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9078.32s)]
*  So you can't see it, you can't picture it [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9081.32s)]
*  But I wanted to just describe it to you because it's here [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9084.32s)]
*  People are around it all the time [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9087.32s)]
*  Saki is very much at the front of people's minds here [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9090.32s)]
*  Thank you so much Anna [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9093.32s)]
*  I'm very familiar with the stall [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9096.32s)]
*  Lots of friends and family who always send me pictures there [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9099.32s)]
*  And a lot of my family are based there [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9102.32s)]
*  I should say also the women of our family [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9105.32s)]
*  Particularly Saki's mother and his two sisters [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9108.32s)]
*  Have been extraordinary throughout this whole time [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9111.32s)]
*  And I think that the women of our family [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9114.32s)]
*  Like Saki's sister Noam have been instrumental [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9117.32s)]
*  In getting legislation passed to support victims [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9120.32s)]
*  Of October 7th who were not necessarily had formal relationships [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9123.32s)]
*  With the loved ones [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9126.32s)]
*  In terms of marriage or partnerships [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9129.32s)]
*  And so ensured that legislation was available for them [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9132.32s)]
*  To get support from the government too [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9135.32s)]
*  So I think that's again for me something that has been [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9138.32s)]
*  A moving part of this past year [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9141.32s)]
*  And why the hostage families are I think [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9144.32s)]
*  The heart and soul of Israel at the moment [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9147.32s)]
*  Is because the solidarity extends widely [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9150.32s)]
*  And much further than just their immediate interest in their family [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9153.32s)]
*  And I think that's what hostage square to me symbolizes [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9156.32s)]
*  And what the hostage families have been demonstrating [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9159.32s)]
*  As a model for Israeli society [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9162.32s)]
*  Probably the best of us in Israel [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9165.32s)]
*  And I think they are leading the way [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9168.32s)]
*  Ademannet thank you for joining us [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9174.32s)]
*  I really appreciate your time this evening here on BBC News [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9177.32s)]
*  And speaking of families as well [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9180.32s)]
*  And as Adam was articulating there what the families have been through [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9183.32s)]
*  I've got some fresh pictures that we can show you now [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9186.32s)]
*  Of the mothers of the three released hostages [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9189.32s)]
*  Who are now in Israeli hands once again today [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9192.32s)]
*  The mothers all together [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9195.32s)]
*  You can see them here these are new pictures [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9198.32s)]
*  That have just been released [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9201.32s)]
*  Those three mums waiting to be reunited [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9204.32s)]
*  With their daughters [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9207.32s)]
*  They only found out for sure [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9210.32s)]
*  It's just worth reminding you they only found out for sure this morning [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9213.32s)]
*  Really at the same time as the rest of the world [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9216.32s)]
*  Found out that their daughters were going to be released today [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9219.32s)]
*  Emily Demary, Romy Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9222.32s)]
*  You're seeing these pictures of their mums [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9225.32s)]
*  When Hamas actually released those names [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9228.32s)]
*  They put them out on their telegram accounts [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9231.32s)]
*  They put them out publicly [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9234.32s)]
*  So actually those women found out [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9237.32s)]
*  At the same time as everybody else [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9240.32s)]
*  That their daughters would be released in the next few hours [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9243.32s)]
*  So these are the latest pictures that we're seeing there [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9246.32s)]
*  Of those mothers waiting to be reunited [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9249.32s)]
*  With their daughters [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9252.32s)]
*  And alongside that of course you're seeing pictures [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9255.32s)]
*  Of the scene here in Hostages Square this evening [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9258.32s)]
*  As people are watching [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9261.32s)]
*  It's worth saying the sound that you can hear in the background [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9264.32s)]
*  Is rolling coverage on Israeli television [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9267.32s)]
*  That people are gathering in front of [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9270.32s)]
*  They're watching the big screen [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9273.32s)]
*  They're getting their information about what is happening [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9276.32s)]
*  And at this stage we know that those three hostages [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9279.32s)]
*  Are now back in the hands of the Israelis [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9282.32s)]
*  If you see these pictures here [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9285.32s)]
*  These live pictures again from Reim in southern Israel [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9288.32s)]
*  That is the military facility [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9291.32s)]
*  From which they will be transferred to the Sheba Hospital [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9294.32s)]
*  Which is just in the suburbs of Tel Aviv [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9297.32s)]
*  Actually not far away from where I'm talking to you now [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9300.32s)]
*  And then those three women will begin [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9303.32s)]
*  A long process of rehabilitation [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9306.32s)]
*  Of physical and mental checks [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9309.32s)]
*  Really working out what they need [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9312.32s)]
*  In terms of medical treatment [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9315.32s)]
*  And psychological support [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9318.32s)]
*  Because there is an awful lot of that [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9321.32s)]
*  That is needed for them [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9324.32s)]
*  And for the other 30 or 40 [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9327.32s)]
*  Hostages who are due to be [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9330.32s)]
*  Released in the next few weeks [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9333.32s)]
*  So we continue to watch those live pictures [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9336.32s)]
*  That we're bringing you live [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9339.32s)]
*  We can speak to David Hale [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9342.32s)]
*  Who is a former US envoy for Middle East Peace [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9345.32s)]
*  Joining us live on BBC News Now [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9348.32s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this evening [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9351.32s)]
*  The events of today [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9354.32s)]
*  What we're seeing now [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9357.32s)]
*  But also the delay in that ceasefire this morning [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9360.32s)]
*  Just give us your assessment of the durability [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9363.32s)]
*  In your eyes of this agreement [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9366.32s)]
*  Well I think the immediate agreement [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9369.32s)]
*  About this first phase is probably relatively durable [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9372.32s)]
*  Obviously there are always spoilers and trouble makers [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9375.32s)]
*  And perhaps differences of opinion about the conditions [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9378.32s)]
*  Of the agreement [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9381.32s)]
*  And the [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9384.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9386.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9388.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9391.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9393.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9396.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9399.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9402.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9405.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9408.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9411.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9414.32s)]
*  The [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9417.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9420.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9423.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9426.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9429.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9432.32s)]
*  The [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9435.32s)]
*  I doubt it [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9439.32s)]
*  The United States has been an essential player [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9442.32s)]
*  In this part of the world for quite some time [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9445.32s)]
*  So United States engagement whether you like it or not [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9448.32s)]
*  Seems to be an essential piece of the equation [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9451.32s)]
*  You know it's one thing to lay out rational ideas [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9454.32s)]
*  What an agreement should look like it's another thing to exercise [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9457.32s)]
*  The kind of leverage and pressure needed to get parties to agree to it [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9460.32s)]
*  And I think the credit first and foremost goes to the Israelis [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9463.32s)]
*  knees. The country's obviously played a critical role behind the scenes, which and they're kind of [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9466.32s)]
*  unsung heroes in this. But the new piece in the equation, frankly, despite all the hard work of [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9471.44s)]
*  the Biden team was Donald Trump's election and his rather stark threat that if by tomorrow this [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9475.92s)]
*  deal had not been put in place, there would be trouble to pay. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9482.0s)]
*  David, in your experience, as we were saying, your former Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9491.36s)]
*  that concept of Middle East peace is something that has proven elusive and enormously difficult [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9496.56s)]
*  to try and achieve for years. What's your assessment of how far away we are from that right now? [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9503.199999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, there's an adage in diplomacy that every crisis is an opportunity. And it is [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9511.68s)]
*  at moments like this where diplomats and leaders should be looking at what is possible. Unfortunately, [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9517.6s)]
*  even before October 7, the differences between not just leaders on both sides, but the people [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9524.0s)]
*  of the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves was as wide as the ocean. And after October 7, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9530.0s)]
*  as you I think you've heard in some of your interviews already today, there's a never again [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9535.84s)]
*  mentality in Israel, which is quite understandable. So they're going to be very reluctant to make [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9540.4s)]
*  compromises on security, which could potentially jeopardize yet again, the citizens of their [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9544.720000000001s)]
*  country. And certainly, obviously, after the decimation of this past campaign, the mood among [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9550.48s)]
*  Palestinians must also be extremely antagonistic and hostile. So I think it's a time to start [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9557.119999999999s)]
*  focusing on the immediate needs, obviously, in Gaza, but also on how do you start to rebuild [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9562.08s)]
*  a climate that might be conducive to modest progress toward that goal that we all have of peace. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9568.08s)]
*  And what changes do you think the Trump administration will bring in for his second [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9574.16s)]
*  time around as president? He has spoken openly. And in fact, we know that both the incoming and [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9585.28s)]
*  outgoing administrations work together to try and get this deal through. Donald Trump made it very, [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9593.119999999999s)]
*  very clear that he wanted the hostages to be released, that he was going to push for that to [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9599.039999999999s)]
*  happen. What are the changes in direction in policy do you think he'll be bringing in? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9603.68s)]
*  Well, I think, as you saw, you just referred to, there's a greater willingness to exercise pressure [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9610.960000000001s)]
*  than I think we've seen in the last year on the parties to make breakthroughs. I think you'll also [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9617.28s)]
*  see a much stronger and forceful approach to Iran, which is, frankly, has been until their own [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9624.880000000001s)]
*  reversals. Really, the actor in promoting malign influence throughout the Middle East, [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9633.279999999999s)]
*  they were largely in charge in setting the pace and the agenda here. That's changed thanks to [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9638.88s)]
*  Israeli action, but it's not finished. And so I think you'll see the Trump administration focus [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9643.039999999999s)]
*  much more intently on how do you actually make permanent the reversals that Iran has suffered? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9647.6s)]
*  How do you end their ability to ruin the day of our friends and our allies and other moderates? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9655.119999999999s)]
*  Secondly, I think there'll be far less inclined to dream the dreams about a two-state outcome [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9660.56s)]
*  and more likely to focus on practical steps needed in order to ensure Israel [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9667.2s)]
*  is secure and to try to bring about a stabilization that may allow us then to return in the long run to [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9671.44s)]
*  goals that we all have. David, thank you for joining us. David Hale, you can hear that the [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9677.2s)]
*  sound of music increasingly loud in the hostages square here in Tel Aviv. I want to bring in our [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9687.76s)]
*  correspondent Jonah Fisher once again, who is at Sheba Hospital in the suburbs of the city. Jonah, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9694.32s)]
*  we've been watching these live pictures of Reim in southern Israel, waiting for those [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9702.56s)]
*  helicopters to take off because the end of the journey for today at least will be when these [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9709.12s)]
*  three released hostages arrive where you are. Yeah, that's right. We are expecting when those [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9714.72s)]
*  helicopters do take off from Reim, which is just alongside the Gaza Strip, they will fly [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9721.84s)]
*  relatively short journey here to the Sheba Medical Center, one of the biggest hospitals [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9729.599999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East. So they will be brought here. Of course, we don't know the medical condition [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9736.32s)]
*  of the hostages. We saw in the footage that they seem to be able to get into the Red Cross vehicle [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9742.88s)]
*  unaided. But there were reports that two of the three hostages had sustained injuries when they [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9749.6s)]
*  were captured on the 7th of October 2023, gunshot injuries. So there are likely to be medical issues [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9757.52s)]
*  related with two of them. Of course, we don't know what it's been like for them the last 15 months [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9764.48s)]
*  being held by Hamas inside Gaza and what the conditions were for them and how they were [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9770.48s)]
*  treated by their captors there. So there may be other medical issues which need to be addressed [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9775.68s)]
*  here at the hospital. We're expecting them to be driven here. I don't know if you can see behind me, [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9780.88s)]
*  there's quite a lot of people milling around. There's also a fence that's been put up, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9786.0s)]
*  which is basically to protect the privacy of the hostages. This is obviously going to be a private [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9792.32s)]
*  moment. I think it's clear that we're probably not going to see them apart from maybe a bus [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9799.84s)]
*  driving through in the background. Most likely we'll be reliant on the Israeli authorities for [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9804.880000000001s)]
*  releasing some pictures and images of exactly what happens here. Because obviously having just [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9810.48s)]
*  emerged from 15 months in captivity, the hostages will most likely have medical and of course [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9817.04s)]
*  psychological issues that may need to be addressed after such a prolonged period [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9825.44s)]
*  and the trauma which has gone with it. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9830.0s)]
*  That's a really good point, Jonah, isn't it? As you were touching on there, it will be a very [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9836.0s)]
*  different experience for every one of those hostages, some of whom were injured at the point [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9841.2s)]
*  at which they were taken into captivity, some of which have had different health issues. It's a very [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9845.84s)]
*  individual path, I think, to recovery from this point, isn't it? [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9851.84s)]
*  Yes, it is. I don't think that we, the media or the public, will really be let in on exactly [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9858.0s)]
*  those aspects of the story. I think this will be very different from the large release of about [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9866.0s)]
*  100 hostages which took place in November 2023, which was about 50 days after the October 7, [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9871.12s)]
*  2023 attacks. It has been much longer. We're now 15 months in. These women, they're in their 20s, [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9880.0s)]
*  they're in their 30s. They may have had, almost certainly will have had, an extremely difficult [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9889.36s)]
*  time. And even if they are in decent physical shape, this is going to be picking up the pieces [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9895.04s)]
*  from this, starting their lives again, getting over the trauma of what's happened. This is [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9905.84s)]
*  something that starts now for them. They've just, we're being told, met with their families at the [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9911.2s)]
*  Reim points just inside Israel from Gaza. But when they come here, when they go in the hospital, [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9917.68s)]
*  that process of trying to adjust to normal life will begin and they'll be surrounded by [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9926.4s)]
*  a huge amount of support by the medical staff here to try and begin that process. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9931.92s)]
*  And as we were saying, Jonah, this is something which will be repeated at intervals over the [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9941.76s)]
*  six weeks or so. There are various hospitals around Israel. We don't know yet whether they [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9947.28s)]
*  all go to that same hospital that you're at now, whether different hospitals will take turns in [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9953.04s)]
*  receiving them. But this is something that they are geared up for to happen at regular intervals [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9958.0s)]
*  for the next 42 days. Yeah, this is the start of a process. It's a process with many moving [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9963.76s)]
*  parts. Effectively, the way it works in terms of the hostages is for every group of hostages that [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9972.88s)]
*  gets released, typically groups of about three, a large number of Palestinian prisoners also get [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9978.8s)]
*  released in return. Today, for example, we're expecting 90 Palestinian prisoners to be released [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9985.6s)]
*  in return for these three Israeli hostages because it's 30 Palestinians to one female [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9992.16s)]
*  hostage. There's a sliding scale of how many prisoners for how many hostages. So we're [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=9998.08s)]
*  having this release today, then there should be a series of releases of three, roughly a week apart [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10004.48s)]
*  through this six week ceasefire and then there will be a large group at the end. I think it's [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10011.599999999999s)]
*  important that we keep emphasizing the fact that what Israel has been saying about these hostages [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10015.92s)]
*  is that most of them are alive. Most of these 33 are thought to be alive. There have been reports [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10021.679999999998s)]
*  that some of them, some of the names on the list have died during their time being held [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10028.64s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. So I think the Israeli public is also being prepared for the fact that [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10035.359999999999s)]
*  as well as hostages being brought back through this process, if indeed it continues without [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10040.16s)]
*  hitches, there's going to be the return of bodies as well. So this is not going to be a process which [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10046.0s)]
*  is going to have a lot of celebrations in it from the Israeli side. These hostages are having to [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10053.119999999999s)]
*  come to terms with their trauma and there's a lot of Israelis who've been cheering on and watching [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10059.039999999999s)]
*  who are also going to have to come to terms with the fact that many of those names on the list are [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10065.68s)]
*  also not going to come home alive. Jonas, stay with us for just a moment. We've just got a new [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10070.960000000001s)]
*  statement from Mandy Demare, the mum of Emily Demare, the British-Israeli dual citizen, one of [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10079.2s)]
*  the three hostages who's been released. Let me read it to you in full. It says after 471 days, [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10086.32s)]
*  Emily is finally home. I want to thank everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily throughout [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10093.759999999998s)]
*  this horrendous ordeal and who never stopped saying her name. In Israel, Britain, the United States [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10098.32s)]
*  and around the world, thank you for bringing Emily home. While Emily's nightmare in Gaza is over, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10103.92s)]
*  for too many other families the impossible wait continues. Every last hostage must be released [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10109.599999999999s)]
*  and humanitarian aid must be provided to the hostages who are still waiting to come home. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10115.199999999999s)]
*  She goes on to say, of course, and this is something that we hear very regularly and always [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10120.08s)]
*  respect, it says we ask that the media please respect Emily's and our family's privacy during [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10124.880000000001s)]
*  this time. Jonah, that is an interesting point and I think a key point that she makes there as well [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10130.16s)]
*  is that the hostage families, in terms of the medical side of this, they have asked repeatedly [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10136.960000000001s)]
*  for access to be given to the hostages in captivity by, well, the name that comes up [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10143.12s)]
*  most often is the Red Cross, the same people who actually help to administer the handover of [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10149.2s)]
*  hostages because we know that for many of those hostages and for many of those families, that they [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10154.160000000002s)]
*  haven't had any medical attention, they haven't had any help and that is something that those [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10161.52s)]
*  families have really been pushing for, for those who remain in captivity to be able to get some [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10165.68s)]
*  kind of medical and psychological help if they need it. Yeah, many of their families have just [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10171.84s)]
*  had fragments of information, maybe a video, maybe a comment from another hostage in a video [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10178.08s)]
*  which has been released by her masters, the only indication perhaps that their loved one has [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10184.8s)]
*  actually managed to survive and has continued living in captivity and I think it's important [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10190.24s)]
*  to stress, Anna, that though we've got 33 names who are on this list and are due to be released [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10196.16s)]
*  in phases throughout the first part of this three-part ceasefire agreement, there are [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10202.72s)]
*  about 60 other names who are not included on the list, we think maybe half of them at most may be [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10210.64s)]
*  still alive, they are men mostly of military age who are not being included and their fate really [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10219.519999999999s)]
*  is tied up with the negotiations for the second part of this agreement which will start 16 days [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10227.119999999999s)]
*  from now and those are expected to be really extremely difficult in terms of the negotiations, [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10233.439999999999s)]
*  they deal with the core issues about the future of Gaza such as who will govern it in the future, [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10239.92s)]
*  Israel's been very clear that it doesn't want Hamas involved, what role will Israel play, [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10247.2s)]
*  where will its military be, where will it pull out of and the concern for the families of those [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10252.640000000001s)]
*  hostages, the ones who are not part of the phase one, is that we may get into a situation where [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10259.76s)]
*  those talks deadlock and their loved ones end up being almost forgotten and left in Gaza for [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10265.28s)]
*  an extremely long period. Our chief international correspondent is still with us, as we continue to [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10273.52s)]
*  focus on these live pictures you can really see the contrast between those two images that we are [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10284.640000000001s)]
*  seeing at the moment, those flashing blue and red lights down there in the south of Israel in [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10290.800000000001s)]
*  Reim as we wait for the hostages to be taken to the hospital that we were just hearing from Jonah [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10298.56s)]
*  at and then the crowd here in hostages square in Tala B, you know watching and waiting for news, [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10304.0s)]
*  two very contrasting images that I think show, don't they, the range of experience [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10310.72s)]
*  that is involved in a moment like this? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10318.24s)]
*  A moment Anna that the families of those three hostages, three hostages who are now free, [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10322.32s)]
*  now they're now ex-hostages, they thought they would never see the first day of the first phase [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10330.4s)]
*  of a very complex political deal, an agreement reached through indirect negotiations between Israel [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10338.720000000001s)]
*  and Hamas described as the humanitarian phase and this is what we're seeing throughout the day and [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10347.439999999999s)]
*  in this moment now if you're just joining us we are providing live special coverage of the release [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10353.119999999999s)]

*  of the deal reached days ago indirectly between Israel and Hamas and the Israeli government [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10368.32s)]
*  Israel and Hamas after Qatari, American and Egyptian mediation. Intensely emotional scenes [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10376.72s)]
*  we've been showing on air the images that have been released to the media by the Israeli [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10384.88s)]
*  defense forces, one of them where the three mothers of the women of Emily, Romy and Dorin [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10392.16s)]

*  captivity in the Gaza Strip, 471 days of captivity which have ended in the past a few hours. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10406.88s)]
*  You understand that they've now been reunited and that there will be images released of those [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10415.679999999998s)]
*  emotional reunions, intensely personal that they have to share with Israel because this is a really [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10423.84s)]
*  a moment of collective happiness in Israel to see the hostages come home again. We understand that [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10430.88s)]
*  they will now get some preliminary medical assessments, two of the three women in their [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10440.56s)]
*  20s early 30s were injured on that horrific day seared in memory in Israel October the 7th [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10446.4s)]
*  so they all get some initial medical care and then they will be taken by helicopter. We've been [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10454.72s)]

*  for people who want to be part of this moment and we've been hearing about the yellow balloons [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10496.880000000001s)]
*  that are in the air, a symbol of solidarity with the with the hostages. An extraordinary [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10502.880000000001s)]
*  moment we've also been broadcasting images of the situation around Ofer prison where [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10511.92s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released over the coming weeks today we understand [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10518.64s)]
*  that 90 will be released 30 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for every Israeli hostage released. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10524.880000000001s)]
*  We're not sure how much live coverage we'll be able to provide you but we were are expecting [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10534.8s)]
*  to get images of the releases there as well the emotional reunions we are also certain to see as [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10539.2s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners which the Israelis which the Palestinians describe as hostages because [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10546.56s)]
*  they've been held many of them without charges under the system of administrative detention [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10552.4s)]
*  some of them have been in detention for years some of them since the start of this war 15 [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10558.0s)]
*  months ago and they too will be walking free today so there you are live pictures from Riyam [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10564.64s)]
*  in southern Israel the kibbutz where the three women are now being given medical attention [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10573.04s)]
*  and on the other side hostages square short distance from those live images is our [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10580.560000000001s)]
*  correspondent Jonah Fisher. Jonah you're still outside the Sheba medical facility we were [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10586.160000000002s)]
*  we were told earlier by the Israeli defense forces that the stop in Riyam should take about an hour [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10593.12s)]
*  that was about it's almost an hour ago any update from your from where you are as to when we should [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10600.88s)]
*  see those helicopters lifting off from Riyam and heading toward the medical facility behind you? [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10607.199999999999s)]
*  Not really Lise but it's a relatively short distance by helicopter to get here the the [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10616.48s)]
*  heliport is you know just five or ten minutes walk just down that way as part of this huge [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10622.88s)]
*  hospital complex the Sheba medical center is one of the biggest hospitals in the Middle East so [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10629.039999999999s)]
*  they are being brought here everything that they could possibly need is really here in terms of [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10635.92s)]
*  medical facilities just so we're just expecting that eventually obviously they seem to be taking [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10641.6s)]
*  some time at Riyam and perhaps understandably they're taking the opportunity to to spend a bit of time [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10646.88s)]
*  with their mothers who are there to welcome them back onto Israeli soils so perhaps there's no [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10652.32s)]
*  rush I mean that might suggest indeed that the medical needs are not so great that they need to [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10659.44s)]
*  be raised here and possibly they're just taking their time just starting to decompress a little [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10664.48s)]
*  bit after what has happened to them and indeed those scenes which we saw when they were handed over [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10670.56s)]
*  from Hamas to the Red Cross inside Gaza images which I don't think will go down particularly [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10677.759999999998s)]
*  well here with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu images of Hamas fighters in masks on vehicles [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10684.8s)]
*  with with armed with their with with weapons pushing the the hostages into vehicles to be [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10695.439999999999s)]
*  handed over this is of course a war which Israel fought on the basis of eliminating Hamas it's [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10703.119999999999s)]
*  ended up making a deal with them to exchange hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10708.32s)]
*  and indeed it was clear that Hamas was was keen to make a PR event if you like of that handover [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10715.84s)]
*  of these three female hostages to the Red Cross and now of course they're in Israeli hands and [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10723.199999999999s)]
*  back inside Israel so we continue to wait for them for them to come here we continue to wait [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10728.88s)]
*  for news that that helicopter those helicopters because there are two of them at Reim are are [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10735.519999999999s)]
*  going to are going to take them off take off and bring them here one would imagine that they and [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10741.279999999999s)]
*  their families will spend the first night of freedom probably somewhere inside this hospital [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10745.359999999999s)]
*  so you mentioned the images where the three women were brought to the international committee [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10750.72s)]
*  of the Red Cross who are the intermediaries in this handover of the of the hostages the images [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10758.72s)]
*  of Hamas fighters brandishing guns in the air with their green bandanas their camouflage uniforms [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10765.439999999999s)]
*  those images as you said have caused upset in Israel members of Prime Minister Netanyahu [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10771.76s)]
*  in Israel members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud party have come out and criticized the [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10778.0s)]
*  images because of course one of the war aims of the Israeli government that has been repeated [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10783.92s)]
*  constantly by Prime Minister Netanyahu and his allies is that they want this to be a war to [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10789.92s)]
*  destroy Hamas but even 15 months of an absolutely blistering war Hamas has certainly been weakened [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10795.04s)]
*  many of their top leaders are now dead but Hamas has not been eliminated but this deal has been [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10801.92s)]
*  done and as we were reporting earlier in the day it is Hamas's civilian police in their blue [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10808.960000000001s)]
*  uniforms which will also play a role going forward in this process but let's focus now [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10814.4s)]
*  Jonah just go back to where you are we expect that they the helicopters will bring [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10823.04s)]
*  the three women they're ex-hostages now to the medical facility and they will then [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10829.84s)]
*  we understand meet other members of their family there will be more emotional reunions [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10837.68s)]
*  have there been any indications as to how long the women may stay in the Sheba medical facility [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10845.28s)]
*  for the medical checkups both physical and mental that they are expected to undergo and [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10853.679999999998s)]
*  not surprisingly given all that they've been through and it's only now that they'll be able [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10860.8s)]
*  to speak to medical professionals in Israel to detail exactly what has been the details of the ordeal [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10865.679999999998s)]
*  now [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10876.16s)]
*  yeah then there's been no indication i think that will depend largely on the assessment that is made [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10878.88s)]
*  of what condition they are in and perhaps it's worth reflecting on what we know about [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10884.4s)]
*  when they were taken hostage by Hamas on in on october the 7th 2023 so Emily Demary for example [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10890.24s)]
*  she's the british israeli national who was taken from kibbutz kifar azar in the hamas attack on [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10899.76s)]
*  that kibbutz now there were reports at the time that she'd been injured that her in her leg and [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10908.72s)]
*  on her hand and so there and that would have been a gunshot injury so you know obviously it's 15 [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10914.4s)]
*  months later but it's very unlikely that she will have received anything approaching decent medical [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10920.48s)]
*  care inside Gaza during that period while being held by Hamas so again unlikely that she will be [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10926.0s)]
*  likely that she will need medical attention if not just to do with that but to to do with how [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10932.8s)]
*  she has been treated throughout the 15 months another of the hostages who's been recently [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10937.76s)]
*  Romy Gonen well she was actually on the phone to her mother when she was she was at the nova music [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10942.48s)]
*  festival and was attempting to flee the Hamas attack and was on the phone to her mother and [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10950.16s)]
*  at the time she said they shot me mum and i'm bleeding everyone in the car is bleeding so [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10955.44s)]
*  it's likely again that that that Romy will need to have some follow-up on that kind of [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10961.76s)]
*  injury that she suffered when she was being taken prisoner on october the 7th 2023 so you know those [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10968.08s)]
*  are injuries from 15 months ago who knows what other issues they may have developed during 15 [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10974.720000000001s)]
*  months in captivity we you know we can only imagine how they were treated what life was like [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10981.92s)]
*  for them quite possibly living in tunnels underground in Gaza and you know there may [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10986.960000000001s)]
*  be many other issues which need to be tackled and probably only once they get here to the [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=10994.72s)]
*  shiba medical center later this evening that you know they will be able to be fully assessed but [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9Z3Zzf2tE&t=11000.8s)]
