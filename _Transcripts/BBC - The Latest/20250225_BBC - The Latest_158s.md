Video Description: The BBC board has apologised over "missed opportunities" to tackle "bullying and misogynistic behaviour" by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood.
 
An independent report into what the BBC knew about Mr Westwood's conduct was published on Tuesday, highlighting a series of incidents and allegations it said amount to a "considerable body of evidence" which it failed to investigate properly.
 
The BBC had previously acknowledged six complaints about bullying and sexual misconduct. 
 
In a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ said: "It's all false allegations."
