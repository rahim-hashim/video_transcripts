Video Description: Levels of the most significant planet-warming gas in our atmosphere rose more quickly than ever previously recorded last year, scientists have said.
 
Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are now more than 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.
 
Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere.
 
The rapid increase in CO2 is "incompatible" with the international pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Met Office said.

# Climate change: Carbon dioxide rises more than ever in 2024 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw)
*  Last year saw the fastest annual rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=0.0s)]
*  atmosphere. That's according to data collected and analysis from a research station in Hawaii. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=7.0s)]
*  The study from the UK's Met Office has warned that CO2 at current levels are incompatible [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=15.16s)]
*  with the target of keeping global temperatures below 1.5 degrees. Concentrations of CO2 are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=23.36s)]
*  now 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Last [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=30.0s)]
*  year was the hottest on record with global temperatures 1.6 degrees above pre-industrial [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  levels. Let's speak now to Professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=44.0s)]
*  also chair of the Global Carbon Project, Rob Jackson. Mr Jackson, hello, welcome to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=49.6s)]
*  the programme. How worried should we be? How worried should we be? What do those figures [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=55.28s)]
*  mean? We should be very worried. This is a much larger increase in atmospheric carbon [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=60.92s)]
*  dioxide than we're used to. We're breaching safe temperature levels well past them. And [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=67.68s)]
*  I think the most troubling thing about the increase this year is that it's not caused [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=75.84s)]
*  primarily by a surge in fossil fuel emissions. We estimate fossil fuel emissions are up about [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=80.0s)]
*  1% last year in 2024. But normally the Earth's lands take up about one third of fossil carbon [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=85.64s)]
*  pollution through tree growth and other things. And the Earth is starting to fight back. The [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  El Nino last year meant thousands of additional fires in the Amazon, record droughts in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=98.32s)]
*  elsewhere. Plants are not growing as fast and we're seeing forest death in places. So [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  the Earth is starting to rebel, if you will, and that's deeply troubling. You say the Earth [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=110.2s)]
*  is fighting back. I mean, the Earth's just going to get on with things, isn't it? It's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=117.56s)]
*  us that's going to suffer. It's going to correct itself somehow. This figure of 1.6 degrees, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=121.32s)]
*  you know, I think it's accepted now, isn't it, that we're going to be heading above 2.5. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=129.32s)]
*  That is the most realistic figure of a temperature rise that we'll be able to attain. Is that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=136.48s)]
*  the agreed level? Well, I hope not. Certainly we are heading towards that now. We're not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=143.0s)]
*  slowing down at 1.5. A couple of decades ago it would have been inconceivable that we would [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  have so casually and cavalierly blown by the 1.5 sea threshold where we are now, but we [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=154.84s)]
*  did and we may do the same for 2.0 and head above 2.5, which is a deeply troubling world [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=160.8s)]
*  with sea level rise, ice melt and extreme weather. We do not want to go there, but we [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=168.04s)]
*  just seem to be sort of whistling down the street ignoring what's happening around us. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=172.8s)]
*  Okay, so in terms of what is happening, why are we seeing this fastest rate of carbon [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  dioxide entering the Earth's atmosphere? I mean, we've got the COPs, we've got the statements, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=183.64s)]
*  we've got the increase in renewable energy. Why are we still burning more fossil fuels [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=189.48s)]
*  and where? Where is this concentrated? Well, we're burning more fossil fuels in almost [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=195.72s)]
*  all regions of the Earth. Europe is the primary region, really the only region where fossil [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=202.78s)]
*  fuel emissions have actually decreased, so thank you for all of your efforts. But elsewhere [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=207.48s)]
*  we're burning more. One thing we're doing around the world is producing more and more [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=213.44s)]
*  energy, so we're building wind turbines and solar panels, but because there's so much [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=218.4s)]
*  extra demand for energy, that renewable infrastructure does not mean that we're taking fossil plants [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=223.64s)]
*  like natural gas and some places coal offline and we need to take fossil plants offline [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=230.04s)]
*  and replace them with clean energy. Are we going to do that? Do you think it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=235.52s)]
*  attainable? Because it looks as if man's development and what needs to be done to protect the Earth, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=240.16s)]
*  they don't correspond at all. One of the latest concerns is that the growth of AI and the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=246.88s)]
*  energy needed, of course, to cool those huge sources and the power that's needed to generate [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=253.04s)]
*  and all the processing, the energy that's needed there, where is this energy going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=262.52s)]
*  come from? Fossil fuel, isn't it? To some extent there's a discussion here in the United [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  States about extending the lifetimes of coal plants that were scheduled to be taken offline [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=273.52s)]
*  in the next few years because of so much extra demand for energy, partly coming from data [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=278.96s)]
*  centres and AI and things like that. We have an insatiable appetite for energy and that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=284.2s)]
*  appetite means we need renewables and nuclear and we're still burning fossil fuels instead [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  of reducing emissions. Okay, Professor Rob Jackson, I was about to get onto nuclear there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=296.16s)]
*  but I've run out of time. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQGoXIkTlw&t=302.84000000000003s)]
