Video Description: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has faced backlash since he was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency and charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.
 
Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f√ºr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, and launching online attacks on British politicians. 
 
Some who do not share his views, have protested outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.
 
What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.

# Tesla faces challenges after protests over Elon Musk controversy | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA)
*  Tesla was once a tiny Silicon Valley startup with big dreams to revolutionize the motor industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=0.0s)]
*  Today it's grown into the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles and a leader in sustainable technology. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  CEO Elon Musk has been at the heart of Tesla's success, but he's also been a controversial figure [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=12.36s)]
*  and some of his recent actions are now raising questions about the company's future. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=17.8s)]
*  With me in the studio is Theo Leggett, our international business correspondent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=22.04s)]
*  So, Mr. Theo, we've seen so much on Tesla, who is buying it, who is perhaps not buying it, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=25.96s)]
*  who is selling their cars if they've got them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=31.8s)]
*  Politics and business have collided, haven't they? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=34.56s)]
*  They have, and that's largely because of the role currently being played in the US government by Elon Musk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=36.92s)]
*  If you step back a bit, what Tesla has achieved in little more than two decades is truly remarkable. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=42.8s)]
*  It was just a handful of people with, as you said in your queue, big dreams. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=48.2s)]
*  They wanted to produce electric cars and revolutionize the motor industry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=52.08s)]
*  Arguably, they've done quite a lot of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  They took electric cars from being seen as pretty uninspiring, mundane, short-range things [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=59.44s)]
*  that you wouldn't want to have on your drive to being exciting and fun, putting them in the mainstream. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=65.84s)]
*  I mean, I remember when I first drove a Tesla Model S back in 2012 or 2013, it blew me away [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=71.36s)]
*  because it was completely different from anything we'd seen before. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  So Tesla has grown massively, and Elon Musk has been a big part of that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=80.0s)]
*  He's been the absolute central figurehead of this company, and he has a very loyal following. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  But what we've been seeing since 2022 when he took over Twitter, now known as X, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=88.96s)]
*  and much more in recent weeks as he's first of all been part of the Trump election campaign [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=94.16s)]
*  and then one of President Trump's closest acolytes in charge of the government's Department of Efficiency, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  is that he's become a polarizing figure. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  He's been promulgating his views on X. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=108.2s)]
*  He's been standing up for a government that wants to go out and dismiss lots of federal government employees. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=110.64s)]
*  Some people like that, some people don't. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=115.8s)]
*  But it's made him into a polarizing figure. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=117.64s)]
*  And the question is really whether that's been affecting Tesla's business. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And what is the business doing now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, Tesla, in some ways, it's in very good health. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=125.92s)]
*  The Model Y was the biggest selling car worldwide last year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=128.64s)]
*  But for the first time in more than a decade last year, we saw Tesla's sales fall. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=131.84s)]
*  Now, it wasn't a big fall. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=136.92s)]
*  There was nothing to panic about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=138.0s)]
*  But this is a growth focused company. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  Its valuation depends on it growing fast. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=141.28s)]
*  So it was a bit of an alarm bell ringing there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=144.28s)]
*  And then at the start of this year, in some markets, particularly in Europe, we saw big falls in sales. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Not, I should say, the UK. That's an outlier. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  Sales here rose 21 percent. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  But across Europe, it was down 45 percent in January. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=155.48s)]
*  And we've seen other big falls in February. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  And there is some evidence that Tesla's brand is being hit by what Elon Musk is doing, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  how he's speaking in public, things like, for example, appearing in a video at a rally of Alternative [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=166.48s)]
*  of Few Deutschland during the German election campaign. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=172.32s)]
*  That's a far right group. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=174.92s)]
*  Some people did not like that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=176.72s)]
*  So there is some evidence that people who might previously have bought Tesla's are moving away from the brand. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=178.64s)]
*  But that is not the sole reason why Tesla's sales have been struggling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  What are the other reasons? Because I was going to say, you know, are customers still slightly separating in their heads [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=189.04s)]
*  the allure of what is still a very elite brand Tesla and those who are committed to doing something more environmentally [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=195.24s)]
*  friendly when they're driving to Elon Musk's politics? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=202.36s)]
*  Because that's that's the big question. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, some people are clearly able to separate those two things and have no problem with it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=208.28s)]
*  You know, people are still buying Tesla's. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=212.28s)]
*  But if you look at the wider market, there are other factors being involved. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=215.4s)]
*  So, for example, some of Tesla's model range, which was what was once groundbreaking, now looks a little bit dated. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=218.8s)]
*  The Model S has been on the market for an awful long time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=225.72s)]
*  So has the Model X. The Model Y has just had a refresh. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=228.08s)]
*  But, you know, there are mixed opinions about how good that is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  Some people may, incidentally, have been holding off buying cars because they knew this refresh model was coming up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  But if there's an awful lot of competition on the market now, if you look at what established car makers are doing, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=239.44s)]
*  they've been spending tens of billions of dollars on making their own exciting electric cars. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=245.04s)]
*  And then in China, you have a whole array of new brands. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=250.16s)]
*  Think of Xpeng, think of NIO, think in particular of BYD that are taking moving out into the international market and potentially taking market share from Tesla. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=253.28s)]
*  So there's a lot going on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=263.2s)]
*  The market is changing and Tesla is no longer seen as the way out in front innovator that it used to be. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=264.72s)]
*  And then when you look at the leadership of the company, irrespective of its politics, Elon Musk has a lot on his plate right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=271.32s)]
*  He's leading Tesla, yes, but also X, also XAI, the AI company, and also SpaceX. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=277.96s)]
*  There's an awful lot he's doing. And now he's in Doge, the Department of Government Efficiency, as well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=285.4s)]
*  He said in an interview the other day in answer to a question, how are you juggling all of this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  He said with great difficulty. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=294.55999999999995s)]
*  So there are some concerns that maybe he's got too much on in order to focus solely on Tesla and that Tesla maybe could do with new leadership that was more devoted to the company itself. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=296.12s)]
*  It's a fascinating story, Theo Leggett. Thanks very much. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  I know you've written for the website. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=308.56s)]
*  There's a great long read by Theo. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=310.72s)]
*  Do you have a look there on the extraordinary rise of Tesla and what Elon Musk has accomplished and the current political impact of his work on his business? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l41rWLypsxA&t=314.48s)]
