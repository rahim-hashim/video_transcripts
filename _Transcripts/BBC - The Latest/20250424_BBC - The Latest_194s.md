*  The fathers of two of the girls killed in last July's Southport attack are running the London Marathon on Sunday to raise money for projects set up in memory of their daughters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=0.0s)]
*  Sergio Aguiar and David Stankham, the dads of Alice and Elsie, will be supported by friends and family, including the girls' mothers and the parents of the youngest victim, Bibi King. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=12.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Sarah Campbell has the story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=24.0s)]
*  When me and Elsie last year watched the London Marathon, I remember it like it was yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=28.0s)]
*  And Elsie literally sat next to me on that day and said, Dad, run it for Nanatee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=34.0s)]
*  A little bit of me was like, oh yeah, all right, Els. Yeah, I just never thought I'd be running it for these reasons. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=40.0s)]
*  For David, Elsie's dad, the marathon has provided a focus. The same is true for Sergio, father to Alice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=48.0s)]
*  26 months, I've never done nothing before like that. But for my girl, I'll do 26 or 50, whatever. Doesn't matter, pain or whatever, I'm going to do it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=56.0s)]
*  I am so proud of him for his courage to do this. I'm happy to be there to support him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=70.0s)]
*  I'm so proud of you now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=78.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=81.0s)]
*  I can't wait to see you running down the mile. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=83.0s)]
*  It's just going to be so amazing watching you turn that corner and come down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=86.0s)]
*  Elsie was unforgettable. It is an honor to be a mum. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=93.0s)]
*  Beautiful, intelligent, the best daughter we could ask for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=99.0s)]
*  Bibi was pure joy. Everything was in a dance. She just had this sparkle. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=104.0s)]
*  And running the marathon is raising money and awareness of projects set up in memory of the girls. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=112.0s)]
*  We established Elsie's story. So it's a grant giving charity, giving to causes that bring joy, happiness, support to young children in the community. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=118.0s)]
*  We know that Elsie wouldn't want it any other way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=130.0s)]

*  It will be a permanent memorial to former pupils Alice and Bibi. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=141.0s)]
*  My husband and I will be at the marathon supporting Sergio and David. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=146.0s)]
*  It is just incredible what they are both doing to leave a lasting legacy for the girls. And we want to be a part of it every step of the way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=152.0s)]
*  Elsie would be so happy to see me cross the finish line, especially for the London Marathon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=164.0s)]
*  Sometimes I talk to her, tell her, you know, keep going with me. We're going to do this together. You're going to be with me always. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4-Y9FGAGw&t=169.0s)]
