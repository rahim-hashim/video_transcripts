*  Well, joining me now is Justin Carter, reporter and host at The Shade Room, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=57.44s)]
*  an African-American focused news and entertainment outlet. Thanks for joining us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=61.44s)]
*  I see you've taken the tailored dress code theme there. You're looking very sharp indeed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=66.0s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about the dress code for tonight and what it means. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=72.56s)]
*  Oh my goodness. You know I had to take up this opportunity to rock the dandyism of it all. That [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=76.88s)]
*  is the theme, Katrina. So nice to join you this evening here in the States. Yes, the theme is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  tailoring black style. The dress code is tailored menswear dandyism, the focus of this night. And [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=90.24s)]
*  again, like you said, it is fashion's biggest night. I mean, the Super Bowl of fashion really. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  When you're talking about $75,000 a ticket, $350,000 just to have a whole table for this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  event, this fundraising event for The Met in New York City, it is just a sight to see. So many [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=112.96s)]
*  looks. It's happening right now as we speak. And really, you know, when you think about dandyism, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  you have to think about the formation of black identity from the 18th century onwards. It's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=124.56s)]
*  about joy. It's about moving forward, propelling forward. It's about showing yourself your true [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=130.16s)]
*  identity and fashion form, regardless of where you come from, regardless of where you've been. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=136.64s)]
*  It's about pushing forward and showing your true self. And that is what we're seeing on the on the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=143.44s)]
*  carpet tonight. And Justin, just as we're speaking, we're looking at some of the celebrities arriving. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=147.6s)]
*  Diana Ross just arriving there now in quite a creation, a big long train with white fluffy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=154.16s)]
*  feathers. I mean, the Met Gala is always about trains for the women, isn't it? The longer, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=160.64s)]
*  the bigger, the gown, the better. And we've seen plenty of those this year so far. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=165.04s)]
*  Yes, we have seen trains and we've seen trains, Katrina, from men to listen, men can wear trains, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=169.6s)]
*  women can wear trains. It's all about how you see yourself in the fashion, how you see yourself [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=175.92s)]
*  in this theme. So, yeah, we're seeing menswear on women. We're seeing trains on men. It is really [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=182.0s)]
*  unbelievable. I can't even see it right now because my TV isn't turning to work. But we've been seeing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=188.08s)]
*  so many amazing looks so far. Nicki Minaj, the rapper Nicki Minaj, she's set to appear on the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=193.36s)]
*  red carpet very soon. She just got out of the Mark Hotel and she was in an engaged box. So you really [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=199.12s)]
*  couldn't see her, but she's really always bringing it. Coleman Domingo is someone that was on my list [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=205.92s)]
*  of just, he just knocked it out of the park. When you think of the actor, the Academy nominated actor, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=213.92s)]
*  Coleman Domingo, you think of Dandyism. He is really the embodiment of it. And he had an outfit [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=219.27999999999997s)]
*  change. He is in custom Valentino. I mean, amazing looks. He, again, was wearing Valentino, royal blue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=225.27999999999997s)]
*  It was a royal blue robe with some jewelry. He said that it reminded him of back in the day when [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=233.76s)]
*  he went to church and all of the men wore rings and jewelry just to show up and show up for church, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  show up for God. And that was his nod to the black church. So that was his look through his lens. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=248.0s)]
*  And another one that has made quite the stir tonight is Coco Jones. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=254.48s)]
*  Yes, Coco Jones. She's in a custom creation by an Indian designer, Manish Malhotra. Yeah, the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=259.76s)]
*  ensemble, it was, it's a custom look. She said that the designer traveled miles and miles, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=266.79999999999995s)]
*  hours and hours just to do it for her. It was a floor gazing ensemble, embroidery top to bottom, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=272.32s)]
*  ivory coat with the pants. Our viewers at the Shade Room, we have 30 million followers at the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=279.12s)]
*  Shade Room. They are in awe of Coco Jones. She's a singer that really we follow closely as her [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=284.72s)]
*  career is catapulting right now, her music career. And she did a 10 out of 10 job. It's tailored to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=290.48s)]
*  perfection. So Coco Jones, definitely somebody that I have my eye on. And Teyana Taylor as well. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=297.68s)]
*  She was one of the ones you've picked out tonight so far. And we have to say people are still [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=304.72s)]
*  arriving so we haven't seen the full collection yet. I know it's so hard because people are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=309.52s)]
*  arriving as we speak. So yeah, it's happening in real time. But yes, Teyana Taylor, somebody who [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=314.64s)]
*  was one of the early arrivals. She had a black suit on. It was a pinstripe suit by Marc Jacobs. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=319.52s)]
*  It was a traditional menswear look, but something that really stuck out to me, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=326.64s)]
*  Katrina, with Teyana Taylor is that she had the durag on. That red durag that she had on top of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  her head, that was just like just a nail on the head for me because when I think about custom, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=336.0s)]
*  when even when you think about durags, durags are something that maybe a lot of men wear at night [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=343.28s)]
*  before we go to bed. But you know, sometimes people like to wear their durags tight. Sometimes [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=348.56s)]
*  people like to wear them loose. It just depends on how you are. So really kind of I think leaned [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=353.28s)]
*  into the whole tailored, the tailoredness of the menswear look. And I love Teyana Taylor. It's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=357.44s)]
*  getting a lot of mixed reaction right now on our page at the Shade Room, but she's sticking true [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=364.32s)]
*  to it. She's true to herself and that's all you can ask for. There's a lot of attention to detail [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=370.56s)]
*  on her outfit as on all of them. And Justin, the co-chairs this year are all, or most of them anyway, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=375.92s)]
*  are very, very successful black men. What does that say to black men in America that they are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=382.96s)]
*  being put on a pedestal in this way on fashion's biggest night? Oh my goodness. I mean, it is an [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=388.88s)]
*  amazing, I got chills when I see this, when I saw who the co-chairs are who had an integral part [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=395.04s)]
*  of making sure that this was a success. This event, also this fundraising event, over $31 million [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=401.44s)]
*  raised, which is the most that has ever been raised. So it just goes to show that there is power in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=408.24s)]
*  black voice, especially with black men who have been marginalized in America. So it is a sight to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=413.36s)]
*  see for sure. All four co-chairs, all four chairs, with the exception of Anna Wintour, who of course [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=421.76s)]
*  puts this on, are black men. You got Pharrell, the famous music producer and artist. Coleman Domingo, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=427.92s)]
*  again. You got Asap Rocky and you got Lewis Hamilton. LeBron James, the NBA basketball [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=434.8s)]
*  superstar, also an honorary chair as well. So a lot of different voices from sports, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=440.48s)]
*  acting, music, all of it. It's a great night indeed. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m01nkV2ddw&t=447.52000000000004s)]
