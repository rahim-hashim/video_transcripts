# The Defenders of Donbas: Ukraine war frontline report - BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I)
*  They're one of Ukraine's most decorated brigades, in a daily battle to hold back Russia on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=0.0s)]
*  Eastern Front. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=9.52s)]
*  For the 1st Tank Brigade, it's the fight of their lives. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=10.52s)]
*  Under constant attack from air and ground, they gave us unprecedented access to their [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=18.44s)]
*  front lines. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=26.28s)]
*  While they fight to keep Russia out from a town under constant attack. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=28.16s)]
*  The bombing is relentless. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=39.8s)]
*  Shallow trenches offer the barest of protection from Russian fire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=44.32s)]
*  We follow closely in their daily life and death struggle to halt their enemy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=53.4s)]
*  Outgunned and outmanned, they refuse to give ground. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=62.28s)]
*  They are the defenders of Donbass. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=66.6s)]
*  First light on the Eastern Front. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=77.68s)]
*  And the opening battle of the day for Ukrainian forces heading forward is with the mud. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=80.0s)]
*  War has left Donbass ploughed and churned. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=95.2s)]
*  This is their second spring since Russia invaded. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=99.12s)]
*  The second season of muck and misery. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=102.36s)]
*  And their second year in their struggle to keep their country free. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=104.92s)]
*  Ukraine's Eastern Front stretches for nearly a thousand kilometres. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=111.96s)]
*  Mostly across the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Donbass. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=116.6s)]
*  Capturing here is now Russia's principal war aim. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  We met up with Ukraine's first tank brigade on the Zero Lines just outside Velika Novosilka. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=128.64s)]
*  Few know how to handle this heavily contested ground better than them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=134.64s)]
*  With aged armour the battle hardened crew get ready to fuel up and face their foe. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  It's familiar territory. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=150.76s)]
*  They've been fighting Russia in one form or another in Donbass for eight years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=151.76s)]
*  But the threat hangs heavier now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=158.88s)]
*  Their enemy is close by and Ukraine's forces are outmanned and outgunned. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Still they show no fear. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=168.16s)]
*  But does Russia have a chance of winning this war? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=181.76s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=189.2s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=191.2s)]
*  Ukraine will be left alone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=193.2s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=195.2s)]
*  And the Russian army is ready to fight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=197.2s)]
*  They have a lot of troops. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=199.2s)]
*  They have a lot of troops. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=201.2s)]
*  They have a lot of troops. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=203.2s)]
*  They have a lot of troops. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=205.2s)]
*  They have a lot of troops. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=207.2s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=209.64s)]
*  And this is a well-worn routine for Tank Commander Serhii. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=211.64s)]
*  First he faced Russian separatists in Donbass and now it's the Russian army. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=216.32s)]
*  Since the invasion he's only had a week away from his tank and crew. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  His brigade is one of the most decorated in the Ukrainian army. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=230.0s)]
*  Today they're out to hit Russian observation posts near their lines. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=235.0s)]
*  The tanks may be old but they've barely given the Russians an inch of territory here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=242.0s)]
*  It's a fast game of cat and mouse, life or death. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=249.0s)]
*  And it's left as deep an imprint on the landscape as it has on the men. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=253.0s)]
*  The shell craters stretch for miles. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=259.0s)]
*  And Serhii and his crew are soon in the thick of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=263.4s)]
*  They've found their target across the next field over 500 metres away. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=270.4s)]
*  And they unleash everything they've got. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=276.4s)]
*  Watch as Serhii's rounds hit top right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=293.4s)]
*  Seconds later they lay down a smoke screen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=299.4s)]
*  The orders are get in, get out and take cover. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=304.4s)]
*  Before Russian guns can start working on their positions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=310.4s)]
*  A response is expected so it's time to move. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=315.4s)]
*  And to seek cover wherever it can be found. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  These fierce battles happen daily and have created a wasteland. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  Go! [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=331.2s)]
*  Drones, quickly! [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=339.2s)]
*  It could be a reconnaissance drone or armed. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=347.2s)]
*  They don't wait to find out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=352.2s)]
*  Go to position, go quickly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=355.2s)]
*  Go quickly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=358.2s)]
*  Open ground is their enemy's friend. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=361.2s)]
*  The radio station has told us that our tank has successfully worked on the enemy artillery. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=369.2s)]
*  So we're waiting for the time to get under the artillery fire. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=380.2s)]
*  120th mine has just arrived. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=391.2s)]
*  About 20-30 metres away from us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=395.2s)]
*  I've stolen one more exit from the hour. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=399.2s)]
*  The radio station has told us that we've got an exit. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=403.2s)]
*  We're waiting. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=408.2s)]
*  With God's help we're waiting and everything will be fine. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=410.2s)]
*  We're waiting for 6 o'clock. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  And the Tank Brigade doesn't just have tanks at its disposal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  They're using everything they've got to defend the town of Velika Novosilka. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  The reminders of lives once lived here are scattered everywhere. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  But the rubble of the town is now as much of a front line as the trenches. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=434.0s)]
*  This was the local kindergarten. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=444.0s)]
*  It's now the temporary base for the Brigade's armed drone team. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=449.0s)]
*  There are small groups of people who are on duty. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=456.0s)]
*  You have a helicopter without a wave. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=459.4s)]
*  Don't touch it! [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=469.4s)]
*  We're moving away. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=489.4s)]
*  Unlike the tanks, they're on the hunt for smaller targets. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=497.4s)]
*  At the town's edge, a trench comes into their crosshairs. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=505.4s)]
*  It's a direct hit. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=512.4s)]
*  Russian vehicles are next. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=515.4s)]
*  It's deadly effective. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=519.4s)]
*  But their enemy is using these same tactics. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=524.4s)]
*  War now occupies every inch of Velika Novosilka. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=531.4s)]
*  And months of Russian bombardments are tearing apart what's left piece by piece. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=537.4s)]
*  Its people have mostly fled. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=543.8s)]
*  The pets they have left behind, driven wild by Russian shelling. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=546.8s)]
*  At a secret location, we head to a mobile command post. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=553.8s)]
*  To meet the man charged with holding the town. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=561.8s)]
*  Your men have seen something. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=565.8s)]
*  To meet the man charged with holding the town. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  Your men have seen something really hard fighting. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  As a leader, how do you keep your men motivated? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  This is what a year of Russian shelling does to a town. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  War's burden is crushing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  And for most of the people who lived here, it was too much to bear. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  Russian shelling has blown the life out of this place. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  And along 600 miles of the Eastern Front, the Ukrainian army is absorbing Russia's blows. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  But its enemy isn't just targeting the town. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  But its enemy isn't just targeting soldiers. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=626.2s)]
*  It's targeting towns and villages. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=628.6s)]
*  It's targeting civilians. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=630.6s)]
*  Now, Velika Novosilka, where we are now, was nothing special. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=632.6s)]
*  But the people who lived here are very proud of their new school. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=636.6s)]
*  They sent their kids to the local kindergarten. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=640.6s)]
*  Russian bombs mean that all of that's gone now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=643.6s)]
*  Emptied of life, the streets still have traces of a thriving town that once existed here. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=648.6s)]
*  But few dare linger out in the open. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=656.6s)]
*  As abandoned as it is, Russian bombs still fall here. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=658.6s)]
*  A mortar lands to the left of our car. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=664.6s)]
*  Bombs fall everywhere they can. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=686.6s)]
*  The bomb shelters feel safe. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=694.6s)]
*  There used to be 100 people there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=699.6s)]
*  Now there are about 40. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=701.6s)]
*  They have a leader. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=705.6s)]
*  A teacher, a piano teacher, who taught the kids. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=708.6s)]
*  Now there are about... [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=713.0s)]
*  ...summer people who live in this school. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=719.0s)]
*  Another mortar lands even closer. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=743.0s)]
*  They're zeroing in. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=752.0s)]
*  Any movement here captures Russian attention. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=755.0s)]
*  So speed matters. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=759.0s)]
*  Out here in the open, a moment's hesitation can prove fatal. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=762.0s)]
*  So we move fast in search of cover. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=767.0s)]
*  The school lies broken and forlorn. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=773.0s)]
*  The last children were removed a few months ago. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=778.0s)]
*  But the piano teacher clings on. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=783.0s)]
*  Across empty playgrounds and through silent hallways, her music echoes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=788.0s)]
*  Russia has shattered her town. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=798.0s)]
*  It has dulled and deadened her piano. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=800.4s)]
*  But it hasn't broken Irina Babkina. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=805.4s)]
*  The memories of the town that she loved and the children that she taught [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=810.4s)]
*  keep her here despite the hardship. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=814.4s)]
*  Irina takes us to one of the town's remaining shelters. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=830.4s)]
*  It's very cold. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=834.4s)]
*  The conflict raging above has driven them down here. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=838.4s)]
*  In the darkness, they've made their home. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=842.4s)]
*  They can survive, but it's a place of emptiness and sadness. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=845.4s)]
*  The children are still in the school. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=851.4s)]
*  They're still in the school. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=855.4s)]
*  It's a place of emptiness and sadness. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=857.8s)]
*  And almost unseen, in a far-off corner, a woman sits alone and bereft. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=861.8s)]
*  What was life like here before? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=871.8s)]
*  The children are still in the school. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=887.8s)]
*  Can you tell us what happened to your husband? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=904.8s)]
*  He was fine. He was retired. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=917.8s)]
*  He was shot and shot by a shell. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=921.8s)]
*  He was shot and killed. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=925.8s)]
*  He was wounded and died. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=929.8s)]
*  He bled and died. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=933.8s)]
*  I was here. He was at home. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=936.8s)]
*  I came in the morning. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=939.8s)]
*  He was gone. He was lying dead. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=942.8s)]
*  He was buried. What can I say? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=947.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=950.8s)]
*  We head back out in the fading light. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=957.8s)]
*  Slowing only for broken bridges, Russian guns are still within range, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=961.8s)]
*  and barricades and tank traps along the road. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=966.8s)]
*  And we arrive at war's familiar stricken landscape. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  Here, Russian eyes are always watching. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  The torn limbs of trees are a reminder of the reach of Russian artillery and grenade fire. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=981.1999999999999s)]
*  We're heading to Zero Line, the closest trenches to the Russian positions. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  Brigade Infantryman Dima, he's just 22 years old, is escorting us forward. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=995.6s)]
*  Mortars, tank fires, grads, they get hit by everything here. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1007.6s)]
*  Dima's just told me the village over here is half held by the Ukrainians [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1013.0s)]
*  and half held by the Russians. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1020.0s)]
*  We're told to tread carefully. Landmines litter the ground. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1023.0s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to get through. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1029.0s)]
*  We're going to have to be careful. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1033.0s)]
*  We're going to have to be careful. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1036.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to be careful. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1038.4s)]
*  And we're going to have to be careful. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1041.4s)]
*  As we move closer, Russian fire begins to fly overhead. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1048.4s)]
*  It's time to head for cover. Even the shallowest trenches will do. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1056.4s)]
*  But the team is split up after the first strike and some of us are left exposed out in the open. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1068.4s)]
*  We can go. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1090.4s)]
*  We can go. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1091.4s)]
*  The Russian team is moving towards the trench. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1121.8000000000002s)]
*  Come here, Luba, here. Luba, fast, fast, fast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1125.8000000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1131.8000000000002s)]
*  Let's go to that trench, quick. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  Stu, there's a bunker here. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1135.8000000000002s)]
*  This way. Come on, run. Run. Run. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1139.8000000000002s)]
*  Straight to me. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1143.8000000000002s)]
*  Come on. This way. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1147.8000000000002s)]
*  Down, down, down, down. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1151.8000000000002s)]
*  Get in, get down. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1154.8000000000002s)]
*  That's two Russian shells that have just come in. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1159.8000000000002s)]
*  I think it's tank fire. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1164.8000000000002s)]
*  Landing very close to these positions gives you an idea of how exposed it is here. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1166.8000000000002s)]
*  There's absolutely no tree cover. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  The safest place for these men is in the trenches. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1175.8000000000002s)]
*  They've already taken a couple of casualties here in the last week. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1181.8000000000002s)]
*  There's no time to pause for breath. Deema leads the way to better cover. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1197.8000000000002s)]
*  These few logs offer some protection, but it's already packed tight in here. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1203.8000000000002s)]
*  One, two, three. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1208.2s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1211.2s)]
*  That was even closer. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1213.2s)]
*  They grab every inch of shelter they can. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1216.2s)]
*  And when the next distant boom might end in a direct hit, it's hard not to flinch. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1222.2s)]
*  We're standing on the position of zero. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  Now we're being shot by mortars. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  We were walking along the road, the group saw us from the drone. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  And mortars are shooting us. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1245.6000000000001s)]
*  I think mortars will fire soon. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll sit down and move on. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1250.0s)]
*  All alive and well. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1254.0s)]
*  I always think about my family. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1258.0s)]
*  I have no family yet. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1262.0s)]
*  I have the closest family. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1264.0s)]
*  I have no one else. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1268.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'll be able to go back to the camp. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1270.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'll be able to go back to the camp. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1274.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'll be able to go back to the camp. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1277.4s)]
*  I think I try to call as often as possible, but I call twice a day, morning and evening. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1281.4s)]
*  I don't tell everything. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1289.4s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1302.4s)]
*  I think I should ask the military about this. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1304.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes, good. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1309.8000000000002s)]
*  Good. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1311.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you think she'll be able to do it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1314.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. There are many things like that. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  They have unlimited shells. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1325.8000000000002s)]
*  They have whole warehouses. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1328.8000000000002s)]
*  They can't be stupid all day. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1331.2s)]
*  And we have nothing. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1334.2s)]
*  They say the war will end on the 23rd. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1336.2s)]
*  They are forming storm brigades. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1340.2s)]
*  They gave us tanks. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1343.2s)]
*  Armaments. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1346.2s)]
*  I think we'll win with them. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1349.2s)]
*  We have the Cossacks, so we have brave guys. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1353.2s)]
*  Darren, you and Mitya together. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1361.2s)]
*  I'll go with another group. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1366.2s)]
*  It's working. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1377.2s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1381.2s)]
*  We won't go yet. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1386.2s)]
*  And already war's toll is written plainly across his face. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1391.2s)]
*  Colonel, what's your message to the men out there? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1398.2s)]
*  The men that are in the trenches, the men that are in the tanks, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1401.2s)]
*  your men that are fighting every day. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1404.2s)]
*  What's your message to them? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1406.2s)]
*  If we don't do it now, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1408.2s)]
*  our grandchildren will have to take up arms [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1412.2s)]
*  and defend their freedom of rights. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1416.2s)]
*  So, it would be difficult for us, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  but let's do it now, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1422.6000000000001s)]
*  so our children don't do it tomorrow. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  And the message to the whole world. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  We have to defend our freedom. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1438.6000000000001s)]
*  It would be priceless. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  But the freedom is worth it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  Freedom to speak, to live, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1448.0s)]
*  and if you want to be a free person, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1451.0s)]
*  it's worth it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1457.0s)]
*  We have to fight for it, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1459.0s)]
*  and we're fighting till the end. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1461.0s)]
*  And the second thing. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1465.0s)]
*  I wish there was never a war in their territories, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1468.0s)]
*  in their countries. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1470.0s)]
*  Let them live. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1472.0s)]
*  They don't know what a war is. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1474.0s)]
*  The war consumes every waking hour in Ukraine. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1478.0s)]
*  A day on the zero line can feel like a lifetime. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1483.0s)]
*  But the cover of darkness brings Dima relief, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1490.0s)]
*  for now. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1493.0s)]
*  In the gloom beyond lies a constant threat. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1495.0s)]
*  Russia could attack again at any moment. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1499.0s)]
*  And while its guns are silent, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1503.0s)]
*  Dima shows us the path out. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1505.4s)]
*  But Dima will stand his ground here. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1514.4s)]
*  And he's not alone. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1517.4s)]
*  A shift change brings fresh reserves to the front. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1519.4s)]
*  For the defenders of Donbass, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1524.4s)]
*  this is more than just the fight of their lives. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxrCEylb2I&t=1526.4s)]
