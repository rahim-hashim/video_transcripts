# How are Iran's civilians responding to Israeli strikes | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY)
*  As Iran and Israel carry out strikes on each other, civilians are being urged to seek shelter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=0.0s)]
*  with the Iranian government using mosques, metro stations, schools and other buildings. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=6.0s)]
*  Iran's government currently limits access to the country for journalists, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=11.0s)]
*  but the BBC's Persian service provides news to Iranian audiences in Farsi. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=15.0s)]
*  Farham Ghobadi is a senior reporter at BBC Persian, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=20.0s)]
*  and earlier he updated me on what people in Iran are telling him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=24.0s)]
*  Many people who have texted me in the past 24 hours, they were complaining about that, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=28.0s)]
*  that our voices are not heard, people don't know what we are going through. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=32.0s)]
*  For example, one of the things that Iranian people are extremely worried about is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=36.0s)]
*  what the Israeli defence minister has said recently after the last night barrage of missiles [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=41.0s)]
*  that Iran shot at Israel and at least eight people, Israelis, were killed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=47.0s)]
*  Iranian defence minister said that residents of Tehran will pay the price for that, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=52.0s)]
*  and soon they will pay the price for that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=57.0s)]
*  Right after that, there was a report by Jerusalem Post saying that they expect that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=59.0s)]
*  Israel will ask certain neighbourhoods in Tehran to evacuate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=63.0s)]
*  And things like that has worried a lot of, especially residents of Tehran, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=67.0s)]
*  because they are saying that we are not the ones who are shooting missiles at you, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=72.0s)]
*  we are, many of us, are oppressed by this regime as well, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=75.0s)]
*  and now we are the ones who are paying the price for that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=78.0s)]
*  So there are several things that they are worried about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=81.0s)]
*  One thing is that, that overnights they cannot sleep, they've got sleepless nights [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=85.0s)]
*  because of attacks that are taking place across from Tehran and other cities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=90.0s)]
*  We at BBC Persian received videos last night that Fordow, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=95.0s)]
*  one of the important nuclear sites, was attacked. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=99.0s)]
*  Iranian officials are saying that Natanz, the other site near Esfand, was attacked again, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=102.0s)]
*  and anti-air defence system was activated over there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=107.0s)]
*  But residents of Tehran, many of them are fleeing the capital city, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=111.0s)]
*  however the roads are blocked, some of them, they run out of fuel [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=115.0s)]
*  because they get stuck in the traffic jam for so many hours, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=120.0s)]
*  so they cannot even manage to leave the city. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=123.0s)]
*  So what people are concerned right now is to stockpile food and find a way to escape Tehran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=126.0s)]
*  We know, don't we, that there has been unrest between the people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=131.0s)]
*  and the Iranian regime over the last few years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=135.0s)]
*  Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has been talking about the fact that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=138.0s)]
*  the people aren't with the regime. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=142.0s)]
*  Do you get that sense that this might unite the Iranian people? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=145.0s)]
*  Are we able to get any of that sense? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=150.0s)]
*  I get your point because usually at the time of war there is this rally around the flag effect. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=152.0s)]
*  However, it's I think too early to see that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=158.0s)]
*  What I see when you talk to people, they just are saying that they are in a state of panic, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=161.0s)]
*  they are in a state of shock, so to expect Iranians to go on the streets [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=167.0s)]
*  and protest right now, I don't know how realistic that is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=171.0s)]
*  That was Param Gabbadi from BBC Persians speaking to me a little earlier. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=174.0s)]
*  And just to let you know, on the BBC News live page there are lots more reports [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=179.0s)]
*  from people inside Iran and the effects of the strikes on them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=183.0s)]
*  Do stay with us here on BBC News. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CAA1ntysY&t=187.0s)]
