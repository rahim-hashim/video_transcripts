Video Description: Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered the second-largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Bukavu, after previously capturing Goma in January.
 
Some people were seen lining the streets to clap and cheer the fighters as they marched and drove into the city centre without resistance - seizing the regional governor's office.
 
The Congolese government has acknowledged its fall and urged residents to stay at home "to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces".
 
The UN and European countries have warned that the latest offensive, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes, could spark a wider regional war.

# Rwanda-backed rebels capture second city in DR Congo | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0)
*  Hello, you're live with BBC News. The Democratic Republic of Congo says Rwanda is ignoring calls [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=0.0s)]
*  for a ceasefire after M23 rebels seized a second city. The government says Rwanda is violating the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=5.76s)]
*  DRC's territorial integrity. The fall of the city of Bukavu gives the M23 total control of Lake Kivu, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=12.56s)]
*  following its capture of Goma at the end of January, and has highlighted growing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=19.84s)]
*  fears about the escalation of the war in the mineral-rich region. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  We can now speak to Fred Bouma, the executive director of Buteli, a research institute based [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  in Kinshasa, focusing on politics and governance in the DRC. Thanks for joining us on BBC News. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=34.56s)]
*  What's your assessment of what's happening on the battlefield? Because what we're hearing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=41.84s)]
*  is reports of government forces simply retreating when challenged by the rebels. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=46.64s)]
*  Yes, what we've seen on the battlefield in the last weeks, if we can say, is the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=51.52s)]
*  retreats of the DRC, the Congolese army, but also of the local militia, there was Zolendo and the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Burundian force that was supporting them all the way from the mountains in Kalehe, in South Kivu, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=69.12s)]
*  to Bukavu. And now the M23 has reached Bukavu and it's continuously controlling. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=76.56s)]
*  And we're hearing they're also thinking of putting an administration in Bukavu, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=87.84s)]
*  as they did in North Kivu. And just to take a step back, these are incredibly mineral-rich parts [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=93.44s)]
*  of the DRC, North Kivu and South Kivu, places that have minerals that we use in many of our devices, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=100.88s)]
*  like mobile phones, laptops. Now the US, the EU, the UN Security Council are all calling for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=105.6s)]
*  a ceasefire in the eastern DRC. That hasn't worked so far. So what can be done? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=112.48s)]
*  So far there have been a lot of strikes, but we're still seeing the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=121.2s)]
*  so far there have been calls for ceasefire, not only by the US and Europe, but also by [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  the SADC and its African community that recently. But there is no enough pressure on both parties to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  to seize the attack, especially on M23 in Rwanda. And without that, it's very likely, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=147.04s)]
*  it's less likely that there will be any ceasefire in coming days. And I think M23 is slowly, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=157.84s)]
*  and AFC is slowly reaching its objective of controlling a large part of North Kivu and South [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=167.2s)]
*  Kivu. And unfortunately, without a proper response from the Congress government and the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=174.4s)]
*  international community, this may go in other provinces as well. Fred, as we're speaking, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  I just want to let our viewers know that we also have live pictures on the screens at the moment. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=187.12s)]
*  This is from Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, and this is the plane that is carrying Marco Rubio, the US [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=193.6s)]
*  Secretary of State. So he's just arriving there in Saudi Arabia, and of course, he'll have key [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=200.72s)]
*  meetings, crucially those meetings between US officials and Russian officials about ending the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=206.0s)]
*  war in Ukraine. He'll also be talking about the war in Gaza and the future for the territory. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=212.56s)]
*  Fred, just going back to you and the situation there in eastern Congo, you're from Goma, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=219.52s)]
*  the major city of eastern Congo that has been taken over by M23. What are you hearing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=225.36s)]
*  from people there about the impact of the war? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  And the impacts of the war has been dramatic on populations of Goma. As you know, before M23, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=236.0s)]
*  since Goma was almost under siege for about a year, the cost of community increased significantly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  Almost 800,000 refugees, displaced people around Goma, so the life of those people in Goma, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=255.36s)]
*  citizens, was also equally difficult. Now, the banking system in Goma is not functional yet. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=264.16s)]
*  People have difficulty to have access to the small economy that they have in the bank. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=273.36s)]
*  Even if the daily life is starting slowly, but there's still a lot of issues to resolve [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  and a lot of uncertainty, especially for people who do not know where all this is going. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=290.08s)]
*  So, yeah, it has been a tough year, and it continues to be a tough time for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  people who are in Goma and other places. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Fred Baumer, political analyst in Kinshasa, thank you so much for joining us on BBC News. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=309.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LC5bcezAA0&t=315.84000000000003s)]
