# Pokémon's CEO and fans reveal why they think the franchise is still so popular | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ)
*  Pokemon Day is celebrated on February 27th every year to commemorate the release of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  first two Pokemon games back in 1996. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=4.68s)]
*  We're here at the Pokemon International Championships to ask fans, what's kept you so engaged for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=8.92s)]
*  almost 30 years? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=13.84s)]
*  I love the fun, I love the social side, I love watching the games. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=23.84s)]
*  It's just such a good atmosphere I think. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  It started around about 2006, probably 2005 when I was in primary. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=29.56s)]
*  I first started watching the anime in around maybe 2003, 2004. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=35.64s)]
*  On the second season of Johto Journeys, I just loved all the different Pokemon, all [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  the designs, they were just really, really, really cute. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=44.16s)]
*  1998. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  I was about seven or eight years old. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  I remember watching Pokemon on TV, which made me become a fan and I bought the first game, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=51.12s)]
*  Pokemon Blue. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=56.68s)]
*  And how long have you been a Pokemon fan? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=57.68s)]
*  Since I was about five years old when I first started collecting the cards. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=59.48s)]
*  It's been a few years after they came out, but I've started probably around Gen 2. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=63.36s)]
*  When I was young, I always had a sense of longing, kind of like FOMO. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=67.0s)]
*  I used to always see conventions like this that were similar and I always wanted to kind [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=71.08s)]
*  of go to these events. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  So being able to be here and network and make friends has been such a blessing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=76.84s)]
*  I've been a Pokemon fan since it came out back in 1996, so almost 30 years, so you're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=82.76s)]
*  talking 29 years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=87.2s)]
*  Pokemon is the biggest brand in the world with millions of fans all over the globe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Thousands of them have descended upon the XL to celebrate the Pokemon International [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=93.36s)]
*  Championships. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  At the event, we not only have Pokemon Center, but also the Pokemon Museum, cosplay events, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  as well as obviously card trading. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=105.32s)]
*  Card trading is big business and a huge part of this event. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  Logan Paul recently spent over five million dollars on a Pokemon card that he bought in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=111.16s)]
*  a WWE match. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=115.28s)]
*  Coming to events like these, you may be surprised by the age demographic of the people that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=116.68s)]
*  are here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=120.64s)]
*  People who grew up with these games when they were younger traded the Pokemon cards in a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=121.64s)]
*  playground, even if we didn't quite know how to do it, and now are passing on that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=125.76s)]
*  love of Pokemon to their own kids. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=129.68s)]
*  So Pokemon, 29 years, how do you think it's remained so relevant and so popular over all [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=131.76s)]
*  that time? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=136.36s)]
*  You know, we're a family-friendly entertainment property and I think part of its popularity [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=137.36s)]
*  relates back to, if you go back to the very, very first game, it was about trading with [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=143.8s)]
*  your friends. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  And so you make friends through playing Pokemon, and over the years, you know, we've had Pokemon [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Go in 2016. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  That brought more people into the brand, partly because, you know, now millennials, they're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=155.92s)]
*  adults, they have their own kids, they're teaching their kids to play, spreading the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=159.16s)]
*  love of Pokemon, and I think through families, through friendship, is really what's been [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=163.84s)]
*  sustaining the brand. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=168.52s)]
*  You know, our mission as a company is to bring people together through Pokemon, and I think [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=169.76s)]
*  that's the secret. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=173.28s)]
*  So for Pokemon, this event has over 5,000 attendees. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=177.92s)]
*  We have 50 different countries and regions participating at this show. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=182.24s)]
*  Most others are much smaller events and more exclusive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=186.76s)]
*  We're running an open tournament that allows people from all over the world to compete. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=190.76s)]
*  So this is one of the largest eSport events in the world as a result. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=195.48s)]
*  BBC journalist Mariko Ooi recently managed to get an interview with the CEO of the Pokemon [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=199.44s)]
*  company where they spoke about lots of different things, but most importantly, what's Ash [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=204.28s)]
*  up to now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=209.56s)]
*  I believe the original game was groundbreaking because it allowed users to exchange Pokemon [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=210.56s)]
*  that you catch with your friends and other players. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=215.72s)]
*  So it wasn't an introverted activity, but it became a tool to actively communicate with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=218.44s)]
*  others. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=222.44s)]
*  The number of Pokemon which started at 151 has increased to more than 1,000 today, and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=223.64s)]
*  their fans also grew and now span across several generations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=228.92s)]
*  Our mission statement is to enrich both the real world and the virtual world with the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=233.2s)]
*  Pokemon characters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=237.16s)]
*  Pokemon Go is the perfect example because you can look for Pokemon in the real world. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=238.16s)]
*  What about counterfeits and patent infringement? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  You recently sued the maker of the hit survival adventure game, Pall World. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  What are you doing about those fake Pokemon? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=250.44s)]
*  We've been fighting fakes since the beginning. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  The more popular Pokemon became, the worse the problem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=256.6s)]
*  It affects our creativity and our customers get disappointed when they receive products [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=259.36s)]
*  that aren't authentic. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  But that's not their only challenge. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm at one of two dozen Pokemon centers where they sell toys, stationeries, cars, you name [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's a separate resale market where Pokemon cars change hands at astronomical [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  price tags. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Influencer Logan Paul currently hauls the world's Guinness records for the most expensive [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=282.92s)]
*  Pokemon trading card, which he bought for more than five million dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=287.8s)]
*  If the cards are rare or seen as vintage, their value goes up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=294.84s)]
*  But it's not our place to say that they are not valuable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  To us, the true value of Pokemon is to play, have fun and communicate with friends. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=301.08s)]
*  Along with Hello Kitty and Super Mario, Pokemon is one of Japan's three big soft power. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=306.52s)]
*  And the Pokemon company is the only one that remains private despite its huge revenue. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=312.64s)]
*  Hello Kitty is one of the characters for Sanrio, and Super Mario is one of the characters for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=319.52s)]
*  Nintendo. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=324.0s)]
*  But Pokemon is the only thing we do at the Pokemon company. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=325.0s)]
*  So whatever profit we make from Pokemon gets reinvested in Pokemon. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=328.64s)]
*  If we go public, we have to focus on growing our profitability. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  And our investors might ask, what are you going to do when the popularity of Pokemon [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=336.0s)]
*  dies down? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=339.44s)]
*  And our answer will be, we'll go bust when Pokemon is no longer popular. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=340.64s)]
*  I've got some questions from my kids who are big Pokemon fans. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=344.32s)]
*  There have been some controversies over the decision to retire Ash or Satoshi in Japanese. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=348.64s)]
*  They want to know what happened to him in his retirement. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=354.62s)]
*  That's the hardest question you asked today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=359.56s)]
*  Well, Ash and Pikachu's journey might have ended on camera, but it's only what you see [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=361.44s)]
*  on TV. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=365.44s)]
*  Even though the TV camera might not be following them, Ash's journey is continuing and his [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=366.84s)]
*  partner Pikachu is right next to him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  We asked a few cosplayers if they had any ideas about what Ash is up to now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  I think he's chilling honestly because he's got on the highest grade, he's up there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  So maybe he's chilling or perhaps maybe he's training the younger generation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  Because I'd love to see him in the new anime because I'm watching that now on BBC iPlayer [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=387.32s)]
*  actually, Pokemon Horizon. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  So make sure you watch that because it's really good. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=392.96s)]
*  Shout out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=395.4s)]
*  I think Ash is living the quiet life. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  I think he's taking retirement to heart and he's using his Pokemon just to help him with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=398.64s)]
*  household chores. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=404.12s)]
*  Maybe if he pops to shops he jumps on Dragonite's back or he uses Gengar to maybe help him do [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=405.56s)]
*  shopping. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  I think he still wants to become, aim to be the best Pokemon master but obviously going [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  on his own journey with Pikachu. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=418.32s)]
*  I think I can see him helping out Professor Oak, being an assistant to him. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=420.24s)]
*  That would be really nice, going back to the roots of things. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=428.24s)]
*  That would be really cool. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=430.84s)]
*  I imagine he's still probably adventuring around the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=432.2s)]
*  I just hope he started aging up a little bit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=434.76s)]
*  Well my personal hopes is that he went on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  If I'm honest I'd like to say he went back to Kalos for Serena. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=442.12s)]
*  I know people online might get a little upset about that but that's what I would hope maybe [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=446.2s)]
*  settle down and grow out to bring out a new generation of champions. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=450.68s)]
*  Speaking to Pokemon fans today you really start to realise this isn't just about nostalgia, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=456.92s)]
*  this is about community. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-OUhOYDhQ&t=462.71999999999997s)]
