*  agree to the ceasefire proposal. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say military aid and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=31.68s)]
*  intelligence sharing from the US have resumed since agreeing to the proposal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=37.6s)]
*  Just hours after the agreement in Jeddah, Russia's attacks on Ukraine continued despite [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=43.04s)]
*  the ceasefire proposal. A woman was killed overnight in a missile strike on Kriviri, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=48.56s)]

*  Here's Tom Bateman in Jeddah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=70.56s)]
*  The talks lasted into the night and ended with a ceasefire proposal far broader than anyone [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=74.72s)]
*  expected, demanded by the Americans and accepted by the Ukrainians. But agreeing a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=80.48s)]
*  truce plan with only one side won't stop a war. Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=92.0s)]
*  in a way that's enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interests, their security, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=98.0s)]
*  their ability to prosper as a nation. And hopefully we'll take this offer now to the Russians [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=102.56s)]
*  and we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=107.44s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky said he welcomed the U.S. truce plan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=111.2s)]
*  The American side understands our arguments, perceives our proposals, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=117.28s)]
*  and I want to thank President Trump for the constructive conversation between our teams. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=121.2s)]
*  He was in Saudi Arabia but not at the talks, in which the U.S. has announced it will immediately [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=126.32s)]
*  reinstate its weapons supply and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Ukraine, ceasefire, Ukraine, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=131.68s)]
*  ceasefire, just agreed to a little while ago. Now we have to go to Russia and hopefully President [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=140.16s)]
*  Putin will agree to that also and we can get this show on the road. The talks at this table lasted [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=145.68s)]
*  more than eight hours. This is where they arrived at the proposal for an immediate ceasefire. But [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=151.52s)]
*  many in Europe have been deeply concerned about that, about the idea of moving to a quick truce [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  without first negotiating the mechanism to enforce it. The talks here have grabbed the focus even as [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=163.84s)]
*  the three-year war they seek to end intensifies. Mr. Trump's officials will take his plan next to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=171.84s)]
*  Moscow, a president who wants an immediate ceasefire but on whose terms. Tom Bateman, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  BBC News, Jeddah. Our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse is in Kiev and explained what a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=184.16s)]
*  difference 11 days have made since those disastrous scenes in the Oval Office between President [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=190.16s)]
*  Zelensky and Trump. I think just hearing the language from the American delegation there that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  they would look to put the ball back in Russia's court and apply pressure on Moscow for the first [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=201.12s)]
*  time. The idea that Ukrainian security would be central to this agreement, it seems that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=206.56s)]
*  after Ukraine's European allies wanted Kiev to mend their cooperation, that seems to have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=213.84s)]
*  happened. And just maybe this could extend into Ukraine having a shot at existing as an [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=221.2s)]
*  independent country, albeit with less territory in the long-term future. I think it's littered [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=227.84s)]
*  with caveats, but I think the resuming of military aid and intelligence from America will be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=235.12s)]
*  welcomed. But this is a country used to war and it's also used to failed ceasefires. Today we've [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=240.56s)]
*  learned that the Kremlin has already had conversations with the director of the CIA, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=246.56s)]
*  for example, so there is a channel of communication there. But this is all on what Russia makes of it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=251.6s)]
*  and whether it wants to cooperate immediately with the idea of a month-long ceasefire. Russia's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=256.64s)]
*  foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has repeated his demand, his assertion that the idea of foreign [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=264.4s)]
*  troops, NATO troops being in Ukraine after a ceasefire is agreed, is still a non-starter, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=270.23999999999995s)]
*  it is still in his words unacceptable. So there are huge tension points down the line. So we wait to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  see what Moscow will say, what its position will be. But crucially, right now there is clearly [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=282.0s)]
*  ongoing dialogue between America and Moscow and this time around it also seems to be in Ukraine's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=289.6s)]
*  corner as well in looking to try and look after its interests. It's a diplomatic turnaround but [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  of course in the era of this Trump administration things can change quickly but it was undoubtedly [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=301.92s)]
*  a moment from Jeddah and Saudi Arabia yesterday. James Waterhouse in Kiev. Let's speak to James [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=308.0s)]
*  Nixie, he's the director of the Russia Anurasia Program at Chatham House. James, good to have you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=315.04s)]
*  with us here on BBC News. We've heard various lines coming out of the Kremlin, they're saying, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, let's not get ahead of ourselves with regard to this proposal but a call between Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=327.92s)]
*  and Putin could take place quickly. How should we read that? Yes, that's right. Well, I think it's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  very difficult to read of course. The conditions change so frequently, so often and so radically [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  but it's like trying to nail water to a wall right now. So we should be a little bit careful [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=344.56s)]
*  of every statement that comes out of either the White House or of the Kremlin. But clearly, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=348.48s)]
*  Kremlin is on the back foot in terms of Russia's, in terms of America's diplomatic efforts right now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=353.12s)]
*  It does suffer from President Trump's unpredictability just as much as the rest of us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=360.96s)]
*  It always said that Biden was a more predictable partner and it preferred Biden. You can argue [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=365.2s)]
*  that one any which way you will of course. But as far as this is concerned, then it is very [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=369.68s)]
*  unclear to me at least why Russia should agree to a ceasefire imposed by the US. Think about it this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=376.08s)]
*  way. The US wants peace on any terms but Russia wants peace on its terms and those terms are very [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=385.04s)]
*  specific and of course to Ukraine's huge detriment. And to refer to the point made by your previous [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=391.52s)]
*  correspondent, then it does not wish to see Ukraine exist as an independent sovereign state. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=397.36s)]
*  That is its sine qua non, its red line. It must subjugate Ukraine one way or another, physically, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=403.04s)]
*  militarily or politically. It doesn't matter too much which. But so and whilst that might be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=409.68s)]
*  acceptable to the Americans, it doesn't necessarily need to see a sovereign Ukraine in the way that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=417.12s)]
*  the Europeans and of course the Ukrainians do, then there is a lot of wriggle room as far as the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=422.16s)]
*  Americans are concerned. So the Kremlin is clearly considering this at length right now, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=427.68s)]
*  worrying about what to do, not wishing to look overly obstinate but nonetheless being quite clear [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=433.6s)]
*  that this will be decided in Moscow, not in Washington. What then can the United States do [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=440.48s)]
*  to encourage or force Russia to get on board? Well it doesn't have many levers and I know you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=447.04s)]
*  could come back at me and say well actually surely there are sanctions and Trump has indeed threatened [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  sanctions and tariffs on Russia as you wouldn't believe. So that remains a possibility even though [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  we see it on off as we see it in other cases in the world right now. So the Russians will be [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=463.12s)]
*  mindful of that but at the same time they have shown an ability to exist throughout this war on [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  very difficult premises with a very adverse economic situation. They've learned to counteract [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=475.84s)]
*  the effects of sanctions so I don't think that is as important to them as their main drive of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  ultimately having a sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union. So America's ability to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=487.2s)]
*  put pressure on Russia is ultimately limited. True it does not wish to see the US go full out [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=495.12s)]
*  onto Zelensky's, onto Ukraine's side but that's not as important as Russia's overall aims, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=501.68s)]
*  ambitions and appetites. I mean you've alluded to sanctions is that the only thing that we're [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=507.12s)]
*  likely to see then if Russia says no we're not having any of this? Well Trump has also said of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=512.88s)]
*  course that he would be willing to arm Ukraine to the teeth, arm it like you've never seen it before, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=518.32s)]
*  the usual hyperbole and again that would be to an extent worrying to the Russians who are only just [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=521.84s)]
*  able to hold the line, make incremental gains in Ukraine and incidentally in its own Kursk region [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=530.08s)]
*  which, or part of which is occupied by Ukraine. So yes there is a concern there, the war is not [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  exactly going swimmingly well for Russia both militarily and of course in terms of its perception [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=543.6s)]
*  amongst the populace at large. So at some point Putin has to sell a victory to his people and if [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=547.76s)]
*  he hasn't made any significant gains then it would be a political risk to him personally and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=556.72s)]
*  politically. So the Russian room for maneuver has radically reduced in the past couple of days and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=562.24s)]
*  especially of course with the news that the Ukrainians are now recipients once again of US [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=569.92s)]
*  intelligence sharing. James good to talk to you thank you very much, James Nixie from Chatham House. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba3PbsOe-0&t=574.48s)]
