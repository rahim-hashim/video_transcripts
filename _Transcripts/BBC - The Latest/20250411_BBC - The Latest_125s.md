Video Description: #MahmoudKhalil #US #ColumbiaUniversityThe Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained last month over his role in pro-Palestinian protests, a US judge has ruled.
 
Mr Khalil, a permanent legal US resident, has not been charged with a crime - in a letter written from the facility, he has said his "arrest was a direct consequence" of speaking out for Palestinian rights.
 
The government has cited a Cold War-era immigration law, declaring that his presence in the US was adverse to American foreign policy interests.
 
The activist has been held at a Louisiana detention centre since 8 March, when immigration officers told him he was being deported for taking part in protests against the war in Gaza.

*  We want to bring you some developing news in the last hour on a story we mentioned a little bit earlier. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=0.0s)]
*  A US immigration judge has ruled that the student Mahmoud Khalil, who led pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York last year, can be deported. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Mr Khalil has been in custody since March 8th when he was told by US immigration officers he was being deported for taking part in campus protests against the war in Gaza and the university's investment ties to Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=15.0s)]
*  His legal team accused the US government of trying to silence people over speech it doesn't support. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=27.8s)]
*  Here's Mr Khalil's lawyer speaking late last month. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=33.8s)]
*  This is a case where the United States government has created a policy targeting Palestinian activists and specifically Mahmoud Khalil for arrest, detention and potential removal because the United States government disagrees with his constitutionally protected right to dissent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, this all comes as universities are coming under increasing pressure by the Trump administration as it seeks to reshape the higher education system. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=56.8s)]
*  Latest developments on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration is looking into an arrangement that would put Columbia University under a consent decree, which would legally bind the school to follow federal guidelines in how it combats anti-Semitism. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=67.8s)]
*  The university has already agreed to some of Trump administration's demands for reforms after it pulled $400 million in federal grants and contracts over allegations of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=82.8s)]
*  It's important to say that Columbia University is alone here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=94.8s)]
*  In March, the Trump administration sent letters to 60 higher education institutions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=98.8s)]
*  It said we're facing potential enforcement actions for what it described as a failure to protect Jewish students on campus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtTWz2htf90&t=103.8s)]
*  Earlier this week, the White House announced it was freezing more than $1 billion in federal funding for Cornell University and almost $800 million for Northwestern University while it investigates alleged civil rights violations.
