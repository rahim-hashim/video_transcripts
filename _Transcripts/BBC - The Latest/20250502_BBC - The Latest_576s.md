# Why cost of living is a major issue in Australia election | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg)
*  In Australia, voters will head to the ballot box on Saturday to cast their vote in the country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=0.0s)]
*  federal election. Among the critical issues for voters is the high cost of living. Both Prime [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=5.12s)]
*  Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader Peter Dutton have been making big spending [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=10.08s)]
*  promises. My colleague Steve Lye is in Sydney and told us earlier what the mood is like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It's just about 6.10 in the evening here, the day before polling day, although early [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=22.0s)]
*  polling has been available to Australians here for the last two weeks or so. We understand [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=27.44s)]
*  that about 6 million people have already cast their votes. That's out of 18 million eligible [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=32.08s)]
*  voters. So quite a sizable proportion of the electorate have already cast their votes even [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=36.56s)]
*  before polling day has yet to begin. You mentioned housing affordability and the cost of living very [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  much on the minds of many of the electorate. Worth to note as well that the demographics of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=46.24s)]
*  this election are certainly interesting because it's the first time that millennials and Gen Z [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=51.92s)]
*  voters will be outnumbering baby boomers, comprising approximately 47% of the electorate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  So what matters to young people in this election is something that will be on the minds of those [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=63.28s)]
*  political candidates as they've been making their campaign speeches and campaign pledges as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=68.56s)]
*  Now we talked a bit about the cost of living and housing being on the minds of voters, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  but that's not the only thing. There's also the geopolitics, geopolitical side of things as well [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=77.44s)]
*  that has really sort of come to the fore. So it's not just the Russia-Ukraine war. It's not just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  what's been happening in the Middle East that we've just been reporting on, but it's really [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=87.44s)]
*  U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariffs agenda that has really shaken things up. We've seen how [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=90.96s)]
*  it's played out in the Canadian election. Will it have an impact here in Australia as well? That's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=95.12s)]
*  something that candidates are trying to assess and determine what Australia's place in the world is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  going to be and how they present that to the electorate. It's certainly going to be on their [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=106.24s)]
*  minds. My colleague Katie Watson has been speaking to voters from across Australia to get their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  thoughts on what matters to them. Welcome to the Wild West. Well, not quite. This is Western [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=115.52s)]
*  Sydney and Australians here are enjoying some Americana. Politics here has been a bit of a wild [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=124.56s)]
*  ride. Every day, candidates trying to control their message, but not always successfully. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=131.6s)]
*  One thing's clear though, U.S. politics and Donald Trump have thrown this campaign somewhat off [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=138.72s)]
*  course. Tariffs are great. It protects, but we should have had terrorist protections many years [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=144.56s)]
*  ago. It looks bad now because they used to have a system where you sell off assets overseas. America's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=149.68s)]
*  fantastic. Trump's the best thing of America. It's going nuts. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just sitting [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=155.04s)]
*  back and watching. It's a bit like a show. I'm just watching. It's quite interesting to watch. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=160.56s)]
*  It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=167.2s)]
*  Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and rival Peter Dutton have repeatedly had to answer [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=171.44s)]
*  questions on Trump. Not everyone though satisfied with the answers. Which is why independent [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=177.04s)]
*  candidates and smaller parties are doing well. Voters fed up with traditional politics. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Since Trump has come in, we've seen a huge shift in the global geopolitical order. And Australia's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=190.24s)]
*  in this position where the U.S. is a close ally and has been for 80 years, but China is our major [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  trading partner. So we have to balance these interests very carefully. Canvases are eager to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=203.84s)]
*  sway any voters who are still undecided. It's like overall economy and also defence. Energy policy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=210.24s)]
*  and cost of living. I care a lot about climate change and also queer rights. A lot of the world [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=218.08s)]
*  is turning very conservative, I guess. That's very scary to me. And global politics is increasingly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=222.8s)]
*  hard to ignore when it comes to casting a vote. Initially the focus was on the cost of eggs, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  the cost of living in general, the cost of energy. But there are some things that are more important [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  than the cost of eggs. And so democracy itself. Canada is a good example. Its Liberal Party was [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  unelectable six months ago. But their elections this week were totally transformed by Donald Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=248.0s)]
*  People here haven't been affected as much by Trump's policies. But what we saw early this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  week in Canada, this leaning towards incumbents, the familiar in an uncertain world, well, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=259.12s)]
*  polls predict that scenario will play out here too. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Australia prides itself on mateship. Staying on side with its friends matters. There may not be [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  much of a team spirit among allies right now. But voters here will be keen to see how their [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  next leader rides out this unpredictability. It really is fascinating to see how events unfolding [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=280.4s)]
*  all the way across on the other side of the world can have an impact here on domestic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=290.24s)]
*  issues here in Australia. We can discuss this a bit further with Conrad Benjamin. He's creator, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  editor and presenter of the punters politics podcast. That's a good tongue twister. Conrad, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=298.64s)]
*  thanks so much for joining me today to talk about this. You've been speaking about the elections in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=304.08s)]
*  the run up to this quite extensively. Tell us what some of your listeners and voters you've [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=309.04s)]
*  been speaking to about their main concerns leading into this election. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=313.92s)]
*  Conrad Benjamin I think the main concerns are the fact that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=316.88s)]
*  society in general in Australia, things are getting more expensive. Housing is now impossible [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=321.04s)]
*  to get into if you're millennial Gen Z. You're now 10 years away from saving to get your deposit, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=325.12s)]
*  even if you started 10 years ago. A lot of my audience and the things I talk about is how the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=330.56s)]
*  system is fundamentally broken and we're sick of politicians who seem to be passing laws that keep [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=335.2s)]
*  this broken system going that benefits their vested interests and their corporate interests, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=340.8s)]
*  and it's just beating down the everyday Aussie punter. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  David [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=347.84s)]
*  The best thing about our political system is that we force everyone to vote and you get to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=364.88s)]
*  preferentially list. I can go top to bottom if the major parties are just tinkering around the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=370.48s)]
*  edges and serving their corporate donors. I get to put a minor party or an independent and then [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  in my electorate, if they don't get up, my vote will flow to who I would rather do. I want to slap [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  in the face or kick in the nuts, I get to choose in the end. Ultimately, I can put who I really want [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=386.48s)]
*  without wasting my vote, which I know in the UK and the US, it's a different system. I think a lot [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=392.48s)]
*  of Aussies are very happy with our voting system that allows us to do that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=397.6s)]
*  Yeah, it does really enable young voters or voters across the spectrum in Australia to really [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  properly engage with the process and understand it's compulsory as well to vote. Do you think then [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=408.72s)]
*  there must be a frustration then from your listeners and for the young people here in Australia [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=416.8s)]
*  to really make their voices heard? What are they doing? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=421.36s)]
*  Yeah, major parties have been horse trading back and forth. Let's take housing for the last 20 [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  years. We have some of the most expensive housing in the world. You wouldn't know we live in a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=431.44s)]
*  country with heaps of land, but for 20 years, the housing crisis has gotten worse and worse and worse [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  to the point where millennials and Jed Zett are just completely locked out. When you look at voting [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=441.84s)]
*  trends at the moment, Albo with his last federal election won with the lowest primary vote in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  history. So as much as he won, confidence in the major two party system is dripping away. And we're [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=453.92s)]
*  going to find out tomorrow whether that trend will continue, whether generations like myself [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=459.6s)]
*  are looking for politicians to actually start fixing broken systems rather than handing us a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  couple of bucks and tinker around the edges and kicking the can down the road. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=469.76s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think it would take for them to address or to make significant reforms [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=475.44s)]
*  that would help? I think they have to lose. Politicians seem to only want one thing and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=479.2s)]
*  that's power. And we need to just take it off them for them to lose an election, to lose votes, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=485.2s)]
*  to lose seats. So they wake up and go, oh, how do we get votes? Well, let's look at where the votes [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=490.88s)]
*  went. Let's look at these independents that don't take corporate cash. Let's look at these [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  independents that don't go work for oil and gas lobby groups just after they made the rules for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  it. So I think the only thing that teaches these politicians a lesson is losing. And let's hope [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=506.0s)]
*  that there are lessons to be taught from the Aussie punter to the politician tomorrow. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=511.52s)]
*  All right, Conrad, we'll leave it there. But thanks very much for your insight to annual [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=519.36s)]
*  perspective. Do appreciate your time with us. Conrad Benjamin, creator, editor and presenter [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=522.0s)]
*  of the Punters Politics Podcast. Yeah, Martín, so you can see there's quite a bit of frustration [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=526.16s)]
*  in the younger population here in Australia that their voices perhaps aren't being heard and their [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=533.36s)]
*  concerns aren't being appropriately addressed. And we'll have to see if they take words or if [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  we see what Conrad play out and they take it to the ballot box and respond in that way. We'll be [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=544.16s)]
*  keeping a close eye on that. Polling opens at eight o'clock in the morning on Saturday here in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=549.84s)]
*  Australia. And we'll be keeping a close eye on it throughout the day and into the evening as well [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=554.32s)]
*  when those results start to come in right here on BBC News. Steve Lye reporting there from Sydney. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=558.8s)]
*  And there's much more on the background to the Australian elections on the BBC News website. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=565.28s)]
*  More analysis of some of the issues that Steve and his guests were touching upon there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=570.7199999999999s)]
