# Three more hostages to be released under Israel ceasefire deal, says Hamas | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU)
*  Hamas have just released the names of the next three Israeli hostages to be freed as part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=0.0s)]
*  the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel. They are Ofar Kaldron, Keith Segal and Yadam Bebas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=5.2s)]
*  The three men are expected to be released on Saturday in what would be the fourth hostage [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=12.48s)]
*  prisoner swap of the ceasefire. Let's go live to our correspondent Joe Inwood who is in Jerusalem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=17.84s)]
*  So Joe, the breaking news, we do now have these three names that we were expecting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=23.44s)]
*  Yeah, Nikki, as you say, Keith Segal, Yadam Bebas and Ofar Kaldron. The name which people may [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=30.88s)]
*  recognise first, I guess, is Yadam Bebas. The abduction of Mr. Bebas and his wife Shuri and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=36.32s)]
*  their children Ariel and Kfir from near Oz was one of the defining images of the start of this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=42.0s)]
*  conflict of October the 7th, these two tiny redheaded children being taken away in their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=47.92s)]
*  mother's arms on a motorbike. And ever since then, there's been real concern around the fate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=52.24s)]
*  specifically of Shuri and the two children. Hamas released a video in November 2023 which they said [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=57.92s)]
*  showed Yadam being told of the death of the rest of his family, they said in an Israeli air strike. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=64.8s)]
*  And ever since then, there's been grave concern. The Israeli government say they knew of the fate [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=70.64s)]
*  but have never commented. And I think the fact that Yadam is being released and the rest of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=75.12s)]
*  family is not, it is being seen as all but confirming that he is the only one to have survived. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=79.6s)]
*  Ofer Kaldron, he was 53 when he was taken from the same kibbutz as Yadam and the rest of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=86.16s)]
*  Bebases, he's now 54. His children have already been released, they were taken as well but were [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=92.08s)]
*  released in the first hostage deal back in November 2023. It is worth saying he did lose two family [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=98.0s)]
*  members on October the 7th. And then the final person who's being released or will be released [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=104.4s)]
*  is Keith Seagunner. He is a dual Israeli-American citizen taken from Kaffa Azar. His wife was also [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=110.64s)]
*  amongst those released in November 2023 and so if everything goes as expected or as hoped tomorrow, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  he too will be free. And Joe, we saw the chaotic scenes yesterday when two Israeli hostages, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=126.96s)]
*  including the first male hostage and those five Thai nationals were handed over in Hiaunis and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=134.56s)]
*  the Israeli government certainly concerned about those scenes and don't want a repeat of it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=140.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think all sides want to avoid a repeat of that. As you say, they were chaotic scenes as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=148.08s)]
*  seven of the eight people released yesterday were handed over to the International Committee of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=153.84s)]
*  Red Cross and they too have expressed concern around the safety of these procedures. It is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=158.4s)]
*  worth saying that they don't organise them but they do facilitate them once they're taking place [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=163.84s)]
*  in all and the Israelis specifically have said they want to avoid that sort of scene happening [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=168.96s)]
*  again of huge crowds of crushes they say endangering the lives of their citizens. And as a consequence [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=174.16s)]
*  of what happened yesterday, there was actually a delay to the release of more than 100 Palestinian [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  prisoners from Israeli jails and so I think all sides are going to be hoping that this, when it [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=185.6s)]
*  continues, can be done in a more orderly and more safe fashion. And I mentioned those hostages who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=191.04s)]
*  were released yesterday, they are now in hospital. I was just seeing a statement from Gaddy Moses' [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=196.32s)]
*  family saying his return is a miracle. Of course there have been some emotional reuniting going on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean the scenes that we saw, the photos we saw of Egem Berger when she was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=213.68s)]
*  reunited with four of her other colleagues, four other soldiers who were taken from the Nahal base. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=219.52s)]
*  They were spotters who were amongst the first to highlight the dangers they saw of what was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=225.52s)]
*  taking place inside Gaza. This was before the attacks and they were also one of the first bases [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=231.84s)]
*  to be overrun and when they were all taken together, held together and now she was the last to be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=237.12s)]
*  released and we saw a photo of them being reunited. And also Abel Yehud, she was a 29 year old and she [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=243.36s)]
*  was, along with Gaddy Moses, she was one of those two who was released in the very chaotic scenes [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=249.68s)]
*  and we've seen very emotional photos of her being reunited with her family as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Joe Inwood live in Jerusalem with the latest on those hostage names being released by Hamas of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=260.8s)]
*  three Israelis who are going to be released tomorrow. Thank you very much. Let's go to the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=267.76s)]
*  live pictures from Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. Of course, it is where people gather [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=271.92s)]
*  and they have been regularly gathering since the October the 7th attacks and just in the last [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=279.12s)]
*  half an hour that we've seen more people arrive there and I would imagine as word filters out in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel of the names of the three hostages who are going to be released tomorrow as part of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=292.64s)]
*  hostage and ceasefire deal, we will see people holding up their pictures and remembering them [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=300.08s)]
*  and if you've seen over the months people always gathering in Hostages Square, we saw it yesterday [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=308.08s)]
*  when we had those latest releases, people watching the live feeds, you can see the 482 days and 5 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  hours 36 minutes and 36 seconds, the clock reminding people how long the hostages have been held [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=325.2s)]
*  in Gaza since those attacks on October the 7th but we have had the breaking news in the last [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  half an hour or so of those three men that are expected to be released on Saturday. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_iNMKWRtU&t=340.32s)]
