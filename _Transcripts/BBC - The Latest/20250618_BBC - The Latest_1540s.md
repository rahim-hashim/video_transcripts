Video Description: The conflict between Israel and Iran started last Thursday - but what was the cause, what could happen next, and could the US get involved?
 
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, Mikey Kay, host of the Security Brief on BBC News, and BBC World Service Middle East correspondent Nafiseh Kohnavard answer your questions on the Iran-Israel conflict.
 
Israel launched a surprise attack last week that it says killed many top Iranian military commanders and atomic scientists. However, Israel does not appear to have achieved its goal of destroying Iran's nuclear development programme.
 
Israeli strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran, according to the Iranian health ministry. In Israel, the government said at least 24 people had died.

# How close is Iran to having a nuclear weapon - and why has Israel bombed them now? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g)
*  Welcome to Your Voice, Your BBC News. It is day six of the conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is reported to be considering joining Israel in targeting Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=6.0s)]
*  Tehran has warned Washington today of irreparable damage if the US does that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=12.0s)]
*  It is a crisis that is escalating by the day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=18.0s)]
*  Now, you have sent us a huge number of questions and here with me to answer as many of them as we can. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=21.0s)]
*  I have the BBC security correspondent, Frank Gardner, and also with us is Mikey Kay, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=27.0s)]
*  a former senior officer in the British military who now presents the BBC's security brief. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=32.0s)]
*  And Nafisa Connaghard from BBC Persian is with us from Beirut. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=37.0s)]
*  Thanks all of you for joining us here. Let's get straight to it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=42.0s)]
*  Frank, to you first of all, the first question from George. Why is Israel bombed Iran now? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=46.0s)]
*  So, Israel's position on this, George, is they're saying that they had no choice, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=53.0s)]
*  that in the last few months they believe Iran was accelerating towards building a nuclear weapon, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=58.0s)]
*  that the talks, the negotiations in Muscat and Rome between US and Iranian negotiators [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=64.0s)]
*  about a deal to curb Iran's programme were going nowhere, that Iran was stringing the US along [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=70.0s)]
*  and that therefore this was the last resort, that they see an existential threat from Iran towards Israel, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=76.0s)]
*  that if Iran acquired a nuclear weapon it would use it because it has previously vowed to destroy the state of Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=85.0s)]
*  That is not a view shared by the rest of the region and it's not necessarily shared by the International Atomic Energy Agency, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=91.0s)]
*  that's the UN nuclear watchdog, nor indeed is it shared by the last open source report we have seen from US intelligence, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=99.0s)]
*  which did not say that Iran was about to produce a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=107.0s)]
*  I'll come back to that point because it's a very important point in a moment or two, but another really important question, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=112.0s)]
*  it is one of the most searched questions and it is, is America going to join the war against Iran? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=117.0s)]
*  Right, can you see inside Donald Trump's head because I can't? It's down to him frankly, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=124.0s)]
*  he held a 90 minute session of his National Security Council, he was closeted inside the White House yesterday [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=129.0s)]
*  with his security chiefs and getting advice on both sides and there are domestic considerations from here [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=137.0s)]
*  because Donald Trump came to power on the back of something called the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=143.0s)]
*  and there are those within that movement who say, whoa, don't let's get involved in another Middle East war, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=149.0s)]
*  please Mr President, we didn't vote you into power to get us bogged down in another Middle Eastern war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=155.0s)]
*  There are others who are saying, Israel's fight is our fight, if we don't stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=160.0s)]
*  we will one day end up regretting it. So he seems to be split. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=167.0s)]
*  Now the reason why the US is so important in this is that Israel does not have the ordinance, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=173.0s)]
*  the bombs to penetrate deep enough underground in somewhere like Fordow where there is a secret or semi-secret enrichment facility [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=180.0s)]
*  and for that it would need America's B2 with something called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=190.0s)]
*  but there would be major considerations and blow back for the US and its Gulf Arab allies if it got into this war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=197.0s)]
*  Well Frank, you set up the next question beautifully because a lot of questions, a lot of searches, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=203.0s)]
*  and Mikey, I'm going to bring you in on this, about that Fordow site because it is one of the sites we've heard a lot about in the last six days. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=209.0s)]
*  Where is Fordow and what is it is being asked? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=217.0s)]
*  Fordow is about 200km south of Tehran, it's one of two critical enrichment facilities that Iran has [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=222.0s)]
*  and it's very much, and I think we've got some imagery and some maps here, it's very much been built in a mountainous region [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=229.0s)]
*  and the reason for that obviously is protection and it basically is one of the key enrichment facilities [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=237.0s)]
*  that Iran have been using to get uranium-235, which is the isotope, up to 60%. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=243.0s)]
*  Now 60% is a key figure because the IAEA report in May basically stated that enrichment purity was up to 60%. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=249.0s)]
*  90% is the key weapons grade metric, so they're not quite there, but it's not a big jump between 60 and 90. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=257.0s)]
*  And you can see on the screen here, it's a very mountainous area. Fordow has been struck by the IDF already, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=264.0s)]
*  however it's believed that the airstrikes were going after surface-to-air missile systems and air defence capability around it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=271.0s)]
*  in order to make it more vulnerable. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=278.0s)]
*  Tell me more because Frank talked about it, because the whole conversation around American involvement revolves around these bunker buster bombs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=280.0s)]
*  So tell us about that sort of munitions that has been talked about and why they are considered so vital here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, Frank alluded to it, the massive ordnance penetrator, the official name for it is the GBU-57. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=296.0s)]
*  It can contain a 13,600 kilogram warhead or about 30,000 pounds. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=302.0s)]
*  It's basically, Matthew, a massive, massive bomb. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=307.0s)]
*  The IDF doesn't have anything like this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=310.0s)]
*  The only way that this particular weapon can be delivered is through the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=313.0s)]
*  They're around $2 billion a unit, an aircraft. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=318.0s)]
*  So if I was looking at the question on how does the US get involved as a former strategic military planner, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=322.0s)]
*  you'd be looking at where the gaps in IDF capability is. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=329.0s)]
*  The IDF don't have any gaps in targeting ballistic missile sites, surface-to-air missile systems or strategic leadership, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=332.0s)]
*  but it does have a huge gap in being able to penetrate something like Fordow. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=338.0s)]
*  Now it's not a foregone conclusion that the GBU-57 could actually destroy the Fordow plant. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=341.0s)]
*  It's more likely to degrade it and it would be more likely to have multiple airstrikes using the GBU-57 in order to do that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=347.0s)]
*  Let me bring Nafisa in from Beirut and a whole range of questions, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=355.0s)]
*  but some of them are really simple in what they're trying to find out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=361.0s)]
*  And I've got a couple here and they want to start by knowing who is Iran's leader, first of all. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=365.0s)]
*  Well, Iran's sublime leader, he's the head of the state. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=374.0s)]
*  He is a religious figure, but he has a lot of power, much bigger than what a president, the country's president can have. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=380.0s)]
*  He is considered as the commander and chief of staff of armed forces. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=389.0s)]
*  And he's the decision-maker for major decisions that should be made in the country, including negotiations with the US. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=396.0s)]
*  He is the one that he would give green light to diplomats and foreign ministry that they can go ahead and speak with the US over a nuclear programme. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=408.0s)]
*  Another question that follows on from that, how much support is there for this regime? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=422.0s)]
*  Well, people are divided, but I haven't been in Iran for 15 years now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=428.0s)]
*  We can't go there. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=435.0s)]
*  But what we gather is that that division is going deeper and deeper. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=437.0s)]
*  Iran has witnessed massive protests only two years ago against the regime. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=443.0s)]
*  It was a mass protest. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=449.0s)]
*  It was widespread. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=451.0s)]
*  And people were, especially youth and women, participated in that protest, asking their rights, their freedom and social freedom mainly. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=453.0s)]
*  And also some wanted the end of this regime. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=463.0s)]
*  But we cannot ignore that this regime still has its own roots and its own supporters. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=468.0s)]
*  The percentage is not really clear, but the issue is that the armed forces, majority of armed forces are connected to the regime. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=477.0s)]
*  And they are still supporting that regime because they receive the power from the regime. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=489.0s)]
*  But people inside, right now, I think the majority of the people in the country are still supporting the regime. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=496.0s)]
*  Right now, I think the youths, they want new life. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=505.0s)]
*  So that can tell you that probably the majority of youths don't want this regime. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=510.0s)]
*  Frank, I've got a question from Rosina who asks how close is Iran to having a nuclear weapon? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=516.0s)]
*  But before you actually answer that, I just want to take viewers through a few of what Benjamin Netanyahu has said over the years. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=524.0s)]
*  Because last week, on the 12th of June, he said, if not stopped, Iran could have a nuclear weapon in a very short time within a year or maybe a few months. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=532.0s)]
*  That's what he said last week. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=540.0s)]
*  In 2018, he said, Iran has the wherewithal to do it very quickly. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=542.0s)]
*  In 2015, he said, they are weeks away from having an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=546.0s)]
*  In 2012, he said, they're close, six months away from having enough enriched uranium to have an atomic bomb. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=552.0s)]
*  In 2006, Iran is gearing up to having 25 atomic bombs a year. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=558.0s)]
*  In 1996, Netanyahu told US lawmakers, ladies and gentlemen, time is running out. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=563.0s)]
*  And in 1995, he said, Iran is capable of creating nuclear bombs between three and five years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=569.0s)]
*  So that arches over nearly three decades. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=575.0s)]
*  So, Frank, what is the answer to that question? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=578.0s)]
*  How close is Iran? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=582.0s)]
*  OK, so first of all, I think let's just get this out on the table. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=583.0s)]
*  Iran says they have no military... [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=586.0s)]
*  Their intentions are entirely peaceful. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=590.0s)]
*  That their nuclear program is for civil use, for power generation. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=594.0s)]
*  Israel clearly doesn't believe them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=600.0s)]
*  Some of their actions have aroused suspicion, not just in Israel, but also countries like the UK and others. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=603.0s)]
*  But you're absolutely right to list that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=612.0s)]
*  There is an accusation here that Israel, or at least Benjamin Netanyahu, has been crying wolf with this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=616.0s)]
*  Now, there was a deal, let's not forget, something called the JCPOA. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=622.0s)]
*  This was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=626.0s)]
*  It was the crowning glory of President Obama's foreign policy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=629.0s)]
*  And it was concluded in 2015, also called the Vienna Nuclear Deal, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=633.0s)]
*  which in return for the partial lifting of sanctions on Iran, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=637.0s)]
*  it put in place some very strict inspections by UN nuclear inspectors inside Iran. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=641.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump pulled the US out of it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=648.0s)]
*  Iran waited a year and then said, OK, you know what? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=650.0s)]
*  If they're not going to take part, then nor are we. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=653.0s)]
*  So they broke a lot of the protocols. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=655.0s)]
*  Now, very importantly, about a week ago, the IAEA, that's the UN's nuclear watchdog, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=658.0s)]
*  the International Atomic Energy Agency, pronounced that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation obligations. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=664.0s)]
*  That is not the same as saying they are about to produce a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=672.0s)]
*  Mikey, let me bring you back in. And a lot of questions still to get through. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=677.0s)]
*  So in terms of answers, let's try and keep them condensed. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=680.0s)]
*  A really quick one here from Asha, who says, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=685.0s)]
*  Will the US's entry, if they enter this conflict, not provoke Iran to strike US targets? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah, Asha, there's certainly risk. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=695.0s)]
*  I assess risk as capability versus intent and probability versus consequence. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=698.0s)]
*  And it's a graduated and proportionate risk assessment on whether that will happen. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=704.0s)]
*  The consequences for the US are fairly significant. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=710.0s)]
*  There are about 40 to 50,000 US troops based in 19 locations across the Middle East. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=713.0s)]
*  You've got Far West, Royal Air Force Akutu, which is on the southern tip of Cyprus. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=718.0s)]
*  There are US personnel based there. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=722.0s)]
*  You've got what's called the CAO, the Combined Air Operations Center. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=724.0s)]
*  That's effectively providing the military picture across all of the Middle East for all of the US operations. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=727.0s)]
*  You've got a US naval facility in Bahrain. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=733.0s)]
*  Q8 is the main logistics hub for all US operations. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=735.0s)]
*  So there is a significant amount of risk there, but it all depends on how the US decide [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=738.0s)]
*  and to what extent the US decide to get involved. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=743.0s)]
*  And I think that would probably start with something like the B-2 stealth bomber. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=746.0s)]
*  Nafisa, let's go back to you in Beirut, because we've heard over days now a number of times [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=750.0s)]
*  the possibility that's being mooted of taking out the supreme leader, assassinating him. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=755.0s)]
*  If that was to happen, what are the likely consequences? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=761.0s)]
*  The consequences, it will be a big blow for the regime, of course, for the government of Iran. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=769.0s)]
*  They will lose their head and he will be killed by another country, which will be humiliating. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=777.0s)]
*  But there are replacements for him. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=784.0s)]
*  Although in recent years, because of the demand of reform inside, there have been speculation [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=787.0s)]
*  and also there have been discussion over that this system doesn't work [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=796.0s)]
*  and maybe there shouldn't be any replacement for Iran's second supreme leader, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=801.0s)]
*  which is Mr Khomeini, who was the leader of the revolution, actually. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=809.0s)]
*  Frank, let me bring you back in, because of course there's been a long lead-up [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=816.0s)]
*  to what we've seen over the last six days. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=821.0s)]
*  A question here from Craig who says, how coordinated are Iran's proxy forces? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=823.0s)]
*  Can they in effect be a second front? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=828.0s)]
*  I don't think any longer, no. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=831.0s)]
*  I mean, the Quds Force, that's part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=832.0s)]
*  This is their job, coordinating those. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=836.0s)]
*  But since the October 7th Hamas-led raid into Gaza in 2023, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=838.0s)]
*  Israel has systematically taken down a lot of this kind of first line of defence that Iran had. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=844.0s)]
*  They have depleted Hamas in Gaza. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=850.0s)]
*  They have largely depleted Hezbollah's arsenal in Lebanon. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=852.0s)]
*  Syria is no longer an ally of Iran because Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=856.0s)]
*  not by Israel, but by Jihadists. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=861.0s)]
*  And the Houthis are relatively constrained in Yemen. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=863.0s)]
*  So they're not very well coordinated, no. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=867.0s)]
*  Mikey, as a result of some of the things that Frank has been talking about, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=870.0s)]
*  that we've seen over the last few months, a question here from Craig who says, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=874.0s)]
*  is Iran's missile arsenal capable of overwhelming things like Israel's iron dome? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=878.0s)]
*  Because we know that Iran very depleted in those Israeli strikes last year. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=884.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the three-tier layered defence system that Israel has is absolutely vulnerable. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=889.0s)]
*  We know that after the October strikes by overwhelming ballistic missile attacks from Iran, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=895.0s)]
*  actually the Israeli defence force had to restock their silos. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=899.0s)]
*  And I think we've got a graphic here of the three-tier layered system. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=904.0s)]
*  If we can just take a quick look at that, I'll take the views through it very quickly. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=907.0s)]
*  On the outer defence, you've got two missiles called Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=911.0s)]
*  Their range goes out to about 2,400 kilometres, and that's the first line of defence, if you like. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=914.0s)]
*  That's what the IDF will be hoping will take out the majority of the ballistic missile threat from Iran. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=919.0s)]
*  The inner bit is called David Sling. That goes out to about 300 kilometres. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=924.0s)]
*  And then from about 4 to 70 kilometres, you have what's called the iron dome, as we know it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=928.0s)]
*  That's the Tamir missile system. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=932.0s)]
*  It's got three to four launchers per battery, 20 missiles per launcher, so that's 60 to 80. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=934.0s)]
*  But they can be overwhelmed quite quickly. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=941.0s)]
*  One of the big things about all of this is Iran has what's called a Fata 2 hypersonic missile. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=943.0s)]
*  That has what's called a hypersonic glide vehicle. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=948.0s)]
*  That means the warhead, when it separates from the main rocket itself, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=952.0s)]
*  at Mach 5, which is five times the speed of sound, that can actually manoeuvre. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=955.0s)]
*  So that's going to be really, really difficult and provide problems for that three tiered layered defence system to be able to counter. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=960.0s)]
*  And the whole system itself has around an 85 to 90% success rate. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=967.0s)]
*  So 10% will get through. And with these hypersonic missiles, that's probably going to atrit that even more. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=972.0s)]
*  Nafisa, let me bring you back in with a question from Matt, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=978.0s)]
*  because of course we've heard President Trump urge people in Tehran to evacuate the capital. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=983.0s)]
*  So Matt asks, where are civilians in Iran able to go? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=989.0s)]
*  Nowhere. President Trump talked about Tehran, which IDF, Israeli army, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=998.0s)]
*  also released some warning for different sectors and different neighbourhoods in Tehran, asking people to evacuate. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1003.0s)]
*  But these neighbourhoods on its own, they are accommodating tens of thousands of people in dense area. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1014.0s)]
*  And recently there have been footage coming out from Iran showing that there have been traffic jamming all around Tehran, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1023.0s)]
*  while people trying to go towards the northern part of the country, which they consider safe. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1031.0s)]
*  But then there have been airstrikes on those areas as well. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1039.0s)]
*  Because right now the targets are so widespread by Israel, no area can be considered safe. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1043.0s)]
*  Although in Tehran itself, the government announced that they are opening the metro stations 24 hours. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1053.0s)]
*  People can take shelter there. And also mosques and schools can accommodate those that have to leave. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1060.0s)]
*  They have to leave their neighbourhoods. But in general, only for Tehran, we are talking about the city that it has, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1070.0s)]
*  more than 10 million on the main part of the city. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1080.0s)]
*  So you can imagine that evacuating those people and fleeing from in this situation is not really possible for many. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1086.0s)]
*  A question from Jalal, and I will put it to you, Frank, who says why hasn't China or Russia offered any substantial assistance to Iran? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1096.0s)]
*  Yes, good question. If I was in the Iranian regime, I would be pretty miffed at the lack of support they are getting from Russia. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1106.0s)]
*  Remember that Iran and Russia signed an agreement, a kind of mutual self-help pact. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1116.0s)]
*  Iran has supplied a lot of Shaheed drones to Russia to use against the Ukrainians. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1122.0s)]
*  It has also sent them over 100 ballistic missiles across the Caspian Sea. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1129.0s)]
*  What have they got in return? Not very much. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1133.0s)]
*  And Russia is clearly trying to stay out of this. They have offered themselves as a mediator, but they are an ally of Iran, of course. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1136.0s)]
*  China imports a lot of Iranian oil and has stayed largely out of this. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1142.0s)]
*  It is possible that China could become an intermediary here. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1148.0s)]
*  They were able to patch up an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran to put that together, and a handshake was done in China. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1152.0s)]
*  So there is a mediation role for China, but so far it is very clear that Israel and Iran haven't finished this fight yet. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1162.0s)]
*  Mikey, a lot of focus over the last few days on Iran's push or otherwise to a nuclear bomb, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1170.0s)]
*  but does Israel have nuclear weapons? Because it is always thought they did, but they have never confirmed that, have they? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1178.0s)]
*  So what have they got, Israel? The real answer is we don't know. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1186.0s)]
*  Israel has not confirmed or denied the presence of a nuclear capability. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1191.0s)]
*  It is not part of the NPT, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1196.0s)]
*  But if we look at, I mean, I think it is important here, if we look at what does it take to have a nuclear weapon, it is three major components. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1200.0s)]
*  The first one is enrich uranium up to 90 percent. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1208.0s)]
*  The second one is the ability to build a warhead, and the third one is the ability to deliver that warhead onto a target. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1211.0s)]
*  We know that Israel has the Jericho 2 and the Jericho 3 missiles. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1216.0s)]
*  The Jericho 2 has been phased out in 2026. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1221.0s)]
*  The Jericho 3 will take the main basis of the ballistic missile capability. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1223.0s)]
*  That's got a range out to about 6,000 kilometers. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1227.0s)]
*  So Tehran is well within targeting distance of that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1229.0s)]
*  But as it stands, there is no overt declaration by Israel on any form of nuclear capability. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1233.0s)]
*  The big question I would ask is going back to that, what do you require? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1239.0s)]
*  The enriched part, which needs to get up to 90 percent, my big questions would be, you know, are Israel producing that organically or is that coming from somewhere else like the United States? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1243.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1251.0s)]
*  Just a quick follow up, Mikey, because Rosina has sent in another question on the back of this saying, why is Israel allowed nuclear weapons but Iran not? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1252.0s)]
*  I mean, and that's what the big question is. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1261.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the answer would be from the US or from the IDF. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1264.0s)]
*  It's all about threat, you know, going back to that probability versus consequence and capability versus intent. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1267.0s)]
*  And I think in measuring that threat from Iran, when you're looking at, you know, what is the risk of them having a having a nuclear capability, intent may be one thing, but capability is definitely other. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1273.0s)]
*  And as Frank was talking to earlier, you know, the peaceful part of enriching uranium to give it a energy supply, for example, that's about three to five percent. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1283.0s)]
*  So when the IEA come out with a report saying that they've got enriched uranium up to 60 percent, the big question is going to be, well, why have you got that? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1292.0s)]
*  And what are you planning on doing with that in terms of that risk assessment? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1298.0s)]
*  People, you know, people might look at Israel and go, well, even if they did have nuclear weapons and the estimate is they've got about 90, 90 nuclear warheads, the risk would be significantly less. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1301.0s)]
*  This is my opinion of them using any form of capability, because obviously that would involve many conversations with the with the US administration as well. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1311.0s)]
*  So but it's a fantastic point you raise is, you know, why should one have and why should the other not? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1318.0s)]
*  But Saudi Arabia have come out. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1324.0s)]
*  He's spoken about the potential of a nuclear capability with Iran. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1326.0s)]
*  And there's also the the very real possibility that if Iran is allowed to develop that, then it would start some form of nuclear arms race inside the Middle East and Saudi would pursue a similar sort of nuclear capability itself. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1330.0s)]
*  Let's go back to Beirut, because I've got a question here from Rich and Nathisa. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1343.0s)]
*  I'll answer Rich's question because we've had so much talk in the last few days swirling around about regime change. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1348.0s)]
*  And the question from Rich is if the current regime is overturned in Iran, is there a natural replacement? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1355.0s)]
*  No, that's the that's the question that the answer to it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1365.0s)]
*  It's not really clear for many Iranians as well. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1369.0s)]
*  The last the previous protests a couple of years ago showed that there is no united opposition in a way that they agree on major points and be able to work with each other and replace this government. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1373.0s)]
*  Right now, there are different options, including the son of Iran's a purivious king who is now living abroad and recently was interviewed by the BBC itself. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1394.0s)]
*  He has supporters inside and outside. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1409.0s)]
*  But how many supporters? We can't really say because he has opponent as well, including inside reformist and those that are against the regime. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1412.0s)]
*  They don't want to go back to or bring back someone that pays only the son of the king that was overthrown for almost 40 years ago by people themselves. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1424.0s)]
*  So it is not really clear that there will be a vacuum after the regime. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1439.0s)]
*  If if the regime falls, there will be definitely a vacuum. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1445.0s)]
*  This is what we know for for now. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1449.0s)]
*  And there is no one replacement for this regime. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1451.0s)]
*  I've got a minute and a half left on the entire program. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1456.0s)]
*  A twin final thought to you, Frank, because, of course, people will be reminded of the Iraq conflict, not knowing what happens after if there was regime change and the chaos for two decades. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1458.0s)]
*  And I suppose that parallel stands here potentially. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1469.0s)]
*  Also, a lot of people worried about the risks of radiation if nuclear sites and facilities are constantly being hit. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1472.0s)]
*  So far, it doesn't seem to be too bad. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1478.0s)]
*  The IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog, report only minimal radiation leakage. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1481.0s)]
*  Remember, a lot of these facilities are buried deep underground. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1486.0s)]
*  So that hasn't been a major worry so far. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1490.0s)]
*  I think what's worrying the region is that if the US joins in, Iran could lash out at not just US bases up and down the region. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1494.0s)]
*  They could potentially say mines in the Strait of Hormuz, choke off part of the world's oil supply and hit desalination plants. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1502.0s)]
*  There's a lot more that Iran could do in retaliation, which is kind of what the Supreme Leader was referring to this morning in his televised address. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1509.0s)]
*  Frank, we are out of time. Thank you, though, for your time. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1517.0s)]
*  Well, that is it from your voice, your BBC News. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1520.0s)]
*  Thanks to Frank, thanks to Nafisa and to Mikey and thanks to you for all the questions you've sent in. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1523.0s)]
*  There is continuing coverage, of course, of this escalating crisis in the Middle East live here on BBC News. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1529.0s)]
*  Thanks for your time over the last half an hour. Bye for now. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpaHFpWW_g&t=1536.0s)]
