**BBC - The Latest:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA)
*  Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and one of the world's richest men, has married the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=0.0s)]
*  former journalist Lauren Sanchez in Venice. The event's reported to have cost around 46 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=4.96s)]
*  million dollars. It was relocated from the city centre after protests from Venetians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=10.8s)]
*  The celebrations are expected to last all weekend and our correspondent Sarah Rainsford [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=16.76s)]
*  is in Venice for us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=21.56s)]
*  There's definitely some protest here in Venice about this wedding. I mean, look at this backdrop. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=23.44s)]
*  It is absolutely beautiful and that of course is why Jeff Bezos and his now wife Lauren [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=29.64s)]
*  Sanchez chose this Italian location, this destination for their three-day wedding ceremony. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=35.52s)]
*  We actually don't think this was the wedding itself. We think that the actual proper nuptials [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=41.56s)]
*  happened in the United States but this is where they've had the three-day party with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=45.58s)]
*  an A-list guest list of celebrities, stars, particularly from the United States. There [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=51.16s)]
*  are paparazzi all over town trying to snap pictures of them as they climb onto the water [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=57.6s)]
*  taxis and dot around this city as they arrive in their mega yachts and their private jets. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=61.28s)]
*  This is a big event for Venice and that's why there is this protest because this is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=66.52s)]
*  an extremely, extremely fragile city, an ancient city on the water as you can see of course [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=72.2s)]
*  and as everybody knows but a city that is sinking. It's a city where there is a massive [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=77.68s)]
*  amount of tourism and the protesters are protesting about all sorts of things. They're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=82.16s)]
*  worried about climate change, they're worried about the impact that massive businesses like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=87.52s)]
*  Bezos' Amazon company have on climate change. They're worried too about locals here in Venice [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  being forced out of this city and cities across southern Europe buy over tourism so they're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=97.28s)]
*  protesting against that. And particularly lots of the protesters that we've spoken to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=103.4s)]
*  have talked about this idea of using cities like Venice as a theme park, as a backdrop, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=107.0s)]
*  as a pretty in fact stunning setting for a wedding but not caring about the city. Mr [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=113.64s)]
*  Bezos has basically hit back against that by saying he is donating three million dollars [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=118.56s)]
*  we believe to a variety of causes including a local charity that's working to protect [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=123.84s)]
*  this city and also the UN agency UNESCO that works to protect cultural heritage. So there's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=129.68s)]
*  a sort of a bit of a hit back from the wedding party or the wedding man himself, the guest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=135.16000000000003s)]
*  of honour, the groom and his bride saying that this is not about exploiting Venice but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=141.08s)]
*  it is about putting a focus on a beautiful city which of course as you can see is utterly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=146.44s)]
*  stunning. Got it really is isn't it. Thanks to Sarah Rainesford in Venice. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9917wJpfA&t=151.92000000000002s)]
