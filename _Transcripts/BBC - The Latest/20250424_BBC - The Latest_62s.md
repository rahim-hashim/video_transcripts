**BBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I)
*  Indian administered Kashmir is among the most militarized regions in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, it is the most militarized region in India, certainly. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=3.36s)]
*  And there are serious questions about how an attack of this magnitude could have occurred, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=6.92s)]
*  questions about intelligence failures and security failures. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=12.08s)]
*  But on the questions about whether it was an inside job, those seem to be purely speculative [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=15.44s)]
*  in nature. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  This is a region that has faced an armed insurgency for more than 35 years now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And so there have been numerous, hundreds and thousands of instances of militant attacks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=26.04s)]
*  What's different this time is that those attacks have rarely been targeted at tourists. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=31.52s)]
*  Because tourists were not usually specifically targeted, people did come out here for their holidays. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=36.36s)]
*  It is highly unusual that we have not yet had any official statement from the Indian [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=43.04s)]
*  government, the Indian police or the Indian military about exactly what happened, how [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=49.28s)]
*  many gunmen were there, how long did the attack go on for, even specifically how many people [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=55.24s)]
*  were killed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ay0lQ5ap6I&t=61.440000000000005s)]
