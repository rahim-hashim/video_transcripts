Video Description: Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment from scientists is deemed successful.
 
A European Space Agency (ESA) project has assessed the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.
 
ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to £20,000 per day.

*  Up and on its way into orbit, on board a small scientific experiment to see if astronauts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=43.08s)]
*  can grow food for themselves in test tubes. It's a mini version of this set up. Bubbling [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=49.2s)]

*  can be turned into all sorts of food. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=62.74s)]
*  They can produce proteins, they can produce fats, they can produce carbohydrates, fibres [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=65.88s)]
*  and then they can be combined to do different recipes and different types of dishes in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=71.64s)]
*  end. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=75.92s)]
*  It's like having a 3D bio printer and printing out the steak that you would like to have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=76.92s)]
*  in the space station. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=81.92s)]
*  You could turn it into a steak? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=83.48s)]
*  Yes, that's the end. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=85.64s)]
*  Right now eating in space isn't a gourmet experience. Although the astronauts are enjoying [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=89.14s)]
*  themselves, the food itself isn't much fun. A lot of it is freeze dried, they have the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=94.64s)]
*  same things most days and it's really pricey. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=99.68s)]
*  The researchers are doing this experiment because it's so expensive to send food into [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=103.4s)]
*  space. It costs around £20,000 to feed one astronaut for one day. And those costs are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  only going to spiral if NASA achieves its aim of having tens and eventually hundreds [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=115.12s)]
*  of astronauts living and working in space. So lab grown food like this could be a cheaper [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  and believe it or not tastier alternative. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=127.72s)]
*  Jakub's job is to turn the chemistry into cuisine. All his ingredients can be lab grown. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=131.84s)]
*  They aren't yet but he's practicing for the day they can. Making spicy dumplings today [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  but anything is possible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=143.36s)]
*  Anything from French cuisine, Chinese cuisine, Indian cuisine, any kind of cuisine will be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=145.84s)]
*  possible to be replicated in space just because we will be able to produce different components. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=152.36s)]
*  Helen Sharman was Britain's first astronaut when she went to the Soviet Union's Mir space [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=158.56s)]
*  station in 1991. What does she think of what could be the food of the future? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=163.4s)]
*  Mmm, gorgeous aren't they? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=169.4s)]
*  I thought they were fantastic. I love the burst of flavour. They taste, I don't think [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=171.4s)]
*  I've ever really tasted anything exactly like that but I would love to have that kind of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=178.0s)]
*  thing in space. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Is it important to get the food right for astronauts in space? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=183.08s)]
*  One of the biggest problems actually is that food is just boring in space and so astronauts [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=186.68s)]
*  tend to often lose body mass, we'd say lose weight on earth just because they're not eating [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=192.28s)]
*  so much because they've not got that variety and that interest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=197.24s)]
*  The experiment will be in Earth's orbit for just a few hours. It will be the first of several [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=201.76s)]
*  experiments in space to help develop the technology. If all goes well, astronauts on the International [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Space Station could be trying out some lab-grown food in just a few years' time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCh1cUFf4Q&t=213.04s)]
