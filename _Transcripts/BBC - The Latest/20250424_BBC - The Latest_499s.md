**BBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI)
*  We start this hour with an exclusive interview with Prince Harry and Megan who've been talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=0.0s)]
*  to the BBC about the dangers to children from social media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=4.96s)]
*  met with a group of families last night who believe social media played a part in the deaths [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=10.8s)]
*  of their children. The BBC's John Kay was there and we'll play you that interview in just a moment or [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=15.52s)]
*  two. Well separately today British and American parents who've lost loved ones took part in a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=21.12s)]
*  protest in New York aimed at improving online safety. They've marched to the offices of Meta [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=26.48s)]
*  which owns Facebook and Instagram saying that stronger regulation will save young lives. One [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=32.08s)]
*  other important development linked to all of this, the UK media watchdog Ofcom has announced today [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=38.56s)]
*  its new children's safety codes. By the end of July social media platforms and websites must carry [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  out more robust checks or face big fines. Well more on all of that in just a moment. First though [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=49.36s)]
*  this was Harry and Megan speaking exclusively to John Kay from BBC Breakfast. The exchanges [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=55.76s)]
*  were conducted off camera but this is the audio which starts with Megan talking about the stories [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  she's heard from various families. These are families that we have been working with for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=67.2s)]
*  several years and the families from the UK meeting them tonight I think sort of speaks to the larger [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=73.28s)]
*  global issue that has been very present on all of our minds for years now which is no matter how [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=78.24s)]
*  polarized the world is or what people may or may not agree on one thing that we can all agree on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=83.28s)]
*  is that our children should be safe all of our children should be safe and I think tonight all [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=87.68s)]
*  of these stories solidify that. I'm an incredibly new parent. Congratulations. So asking for advice [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=92.0s)]
*  because social media is so prevalent what would you say to parents who are trying to navigate [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=99.76s)]
*  social media with their kids right now? The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=104.88s)]
*  from social media. The sad reality is that the kids that aren't on social media normally get bullied [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=112.72s)]
*  at school because they can't be part of the same conversations as everybody else. Life is better [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=117.2s)]
*  off of social media I say that as a parent and I say that as someone who's spoken to many of the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=122.48s)]
*  kids here tonight who aren't on social media because they've lost a brother or a sister to social [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=126.96s)]
*  media but clearly enough is not enough enough is not being done right. Some of the stories here are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=131.68s)]
*  truly harrowing. Having done this for the last three years and being aware of it for the last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=141.6s)]
*  five years you think you've heard the worst of it until nights like this here in America [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  some of these stories they are I mean they're crime scenes like full-blown crime scenes and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=154.88s)]
*  yet these these companies are getting away with it by saying we don't need to give you disclosure [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=159.2s)]
*  you know for the UK families some of the arguments that are being made around privacy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=163.12s)]
*  so you're telling a parent you're telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=167.52s)]
*  their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid the parents who have seen [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  their kid from the time they were a child it's wrong. Where do you hope this goes next then what [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=179.36s)]
*  would you like to see change? I think the work that we've been doing through the foundation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=187.28s)]
*  specifically at the Parents Network in this program creating this community for all of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=191.68s)]
*  these parents and beyond the parents the families the families the friends of these yeah the siblings [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=195.28s)]
*  the friends of these children to really be able to maximize the global messaging on it because it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=200.72s)]
*  is a universal truth that our children are in harm's way by what's happening online and I think [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=207.6s)]
*  for those who do choose to be online and to be in social media as adults as well that we get to set [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=213.36s)]
*  the example and really put as much good and joy into the world as we can it's like that old quote [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=218.32s)]
*  darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that and I think in many ways what we see [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=224.0s)]
*  through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better because every single one of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=228.16s)]
*  them and their resilience is an example as they will say their mouths if you're able to speak to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=232.56s)]
*  any of them directly they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else and and yeah [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=237.6s)]
*  and we are just here to support them in that in such a huge way one of the fathers said you know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=242.4s)]
*  he's like all these photographs as you can see illustrates the children that are lost but we [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=247.04s)]
*  don't have our photographs of all the children who will be saved and it's so powerful if you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=251.6s)]
*  look at it through that lens so that's what we're here to support it's like it's so dark but at the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=256.96s)]
*  same time there's like a silver lining I don't know well it's a language that no one should have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=263.76s)]
*  to speak but they can speak the same language with each other and we're so grateful to have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=268.88s)]
*  created that space for them to be and it's a community that shouldn't even need it need [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=272.8s)]
*  to exist and yet is a growing community every single day tens of thousands of parents like it's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=277.12s)]
*  it's yeah I mean what what thoughts do you take home with you to your children [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  which is grateful that our kids are too young to be on social media at this point [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=291.44s)]
*  right and when you think ahead when they won't be able to avoid one of the reasons why we're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=296.16s)]
*  doing this is because us collectively with all these parents want to make sure that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=301.92s)]
*  things are changed right so that no more parents and no more kids are lost to social media it's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=306.56s)]
*  it's unacceptable it's wrong it's no longer a secret and yet these companies are given this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=312.24s)]
*  power to be able to conceal the truth from from parents as to why their kid took their life [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=317.6s)]
*  well that was harry and megan talking to the bbc's john k now as we mentioned a group of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=324.0s)]
*  british parents who believe that social media played a part in the deaths of their children [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=328.72s)]
*  are there in new york forming part of a protest aimed at improving online safety they've met up [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=332.96s)]
*  with american families who've endured similar trauma john k has more now from new york [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6KOpV1AgI&t=338.79999999999995s)]
