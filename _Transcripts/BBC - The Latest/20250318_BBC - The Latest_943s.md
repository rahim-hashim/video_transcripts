Video Description: The Israeli military says it is carrying out "extensive strikes" in the Gaza Strip, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that more than 400 people Palestinians have been killed.
 
The biggest wave of strikes since the ceasefire began in January comes after the Israeli military said talks to extend the ceasefire failed.
 
Hamas accuses Israel of attacking "defenceless civilians", and says mediators should hold Israel "fully responsible" for "violating and overturning" the ceasefire.
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says Israel will "from now on act against Hamas with increasing military strength", accusing Hamas of "repeated refusal to release our hostages", and of rejecting proposals to extend the ceasefire.
 
In a statement, Hamas says the United States "bears full responsibility for the massacres" in Gaza, after it emerged Israel briefed the US on the strikes prior to launching them.

# Hamas says more than 400 killed as Israel launches ‘extensive strikes’ on Gaza Strip | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s)
*  We begin with more on developments from the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli military has carried out what it describes as extensive airstrikes on cities across [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=3.44s)]
*  Gaza, the largest wave since a ceasefire with Hamas began in January. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=9.76s)]
*  While the Israel Defense Forces have issued new evacuation orders for the areas of Beit Hanun, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=14.64s)]
*  Huzur, Abbasan al-Kabirah and Al Jadida. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=19.6s)]
*  As those strikes continue, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said that at least 413 people [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=30.16s)]
*  have now been killed, including the highest-ranking Hamas official in the territory, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=37.12s)]
*  Mahmoud Abiy Wafa. In its statement, Hamas blamed unlimited US support for Israel [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=42.16s)]
*  for the deadly strikes in Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=49.04s)]
*  While the Red Cross has said that many medical facilities in the Gaza Strip are now overwhelmed, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=52.16s)]
*  this is the scene overlooking Han Yunis where the Nasser hospital is, as you can see there, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  and many of the casualties have been taken to that hospital. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=63.12s)]
*  Well, in a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office, it said it's instructed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=66.72s)]
*  the military to take strong action against Hamas in response to what it says is the group's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=71.12s)]
*  refusal to renegotiate the ceasefire on Israel's terms. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=76.56s)]
*  An Israeli official telling the AFP that the operation will continue as long as necessary [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=80.24s)]
*  and will expand beyond air strikes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=85.6s)]
*  Hamas has accused the Israeli government of violating and overturning the ceasefire agreement, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  which they say they offered to extend. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=93.52s)]
*  Getting international reaction to those air strikes, Iran condemning the Israeli strikes on Gaza, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  describing them as a continuation of genocide. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=105.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, Jordan has also condemned the air strikes, describing them as barbaric. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=108.88s)]
*  Our correspondent, John Donason, is on Israel's southern border and he sent us this update. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=115.6s)]
*  So this is Sderot, the Israeli town closest to the border with Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=122.0s)]
*  The fence is what, just about a kilometer away. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=126.24s)]
*  This is a sort of lookout position and also a memorial to some of the Israeli soldiers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=129.2s)]
*  who've been killed fighting in Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=133.6s)]
*  Now earlier this morning, we could still hear the distant sound of explosions in Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=136.88s)]
*  and also some pretty heavy machine gun fire, fighter jets in the air. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=142.0s)]
*  In Gaza itself, they're saying it's one of the deadliest days of the war so far, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=146.72s)]
*  since October the 7th, 2023. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=152.32s)]
*  The bodies have been piling up, the hospitals have been inundated with casualties, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  and after a night like that, well, it's pretty difficult to say that the so-called ceasefire [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  is still intact. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  I guess the question is, is this a limited Israeli operation to try and put pressure [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=167.44s)]
*  on Hamas or is it the start of the war resuming? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=173.84s)]
*  Now I was just talking to one soldier just down the road over coffee this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=177.92s)]
*  He told me that he was one of some 40,000 Israeli soldiers who got a message yesterday [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=182.16s)]
*  calling them up in order to be ready for some sort of operation at the weekend. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=187.68s)]
*  He told me that some sort of ground invasion was inevitable. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=192.72s)]
*  He said it was important to finish the job. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=198.0s)]
*  Another young woman working at the cafe, she said she was happy that it looked like the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=201.6s)]
*  war might be resuming because she said every day of the ceasefire was giving Hamas a chance [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=206.88s)]
*  to regroup and to plan future attacks on Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=213.44s)]
*  There are still plenty of people in Israel who would be happy if the war wasn't over. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=218.0s)]
*  That's John Donnison there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring you some pictures that have just come into us that show you the aftermath of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  those strikes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=230.56s)]
*  These are classrooms in a school in Gaza City. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=231.76s)]
*  As you can see, they're reduced to rubble in the aftermath of those strikes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=236.24s)]
*  The latest death toll that we are getting from the Hamas-Ron Health Ministry now is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=243.76s)]
*  413 people killed in those strikes and hundreds injured in the Red Cross saying that they [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=249.6s)]
*  are overwhelmed at the moment when it comes to trying to provide healthcare and treatments. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=259.92s)]
*  Those pictures there of the school in Gaza City. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=268.64s)]
*  Our Gaza correspondent Rushdie Abu Alouf, who is based in Cairo now, had more about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=271.68s)]
*  the impact of those strikes on people living in the territory. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=279.12s)]
*  You know the intensity of the strikes are less than when they started at around 2 o'clock [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=283.52s)]
*  in the morning but still going on in a few places. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=289.68s)]
*  The last one was in the middle camps airstrike that killed three people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=293.52s)]
*  The prayer, people started fasting at around 4 o'clock in the morning in Gaza. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=298.32s)]
*  So the airstrikes started around 2 o'clock when most of the people were already started [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=304.56s)]
*  preparing or up to prepare the pre-dune meal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=310.08s)]
*  Yes, there is a shortage of food and fuel and water in Gaza but not like before during [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=313.76s)]
*  the war because Israel up until like two weeks ago used to allow about 500 trucks every [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=322.0s)]
*  day and there is a lot of items still available in the market. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=327.76s)]
*  So it's the holy month of Ramadan and people were enjoying the first two weeks and the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=332.24s)]
*  57 days since January the 19th when the ceasefire went into effect. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=336.88s)]
*  It was a relative calm despite the difficulties that people are facing and the daily challenge [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  of trying to find food and water. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=351.52s)]
*  Roshdi, Abu Alouf there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=354.88s)]
*  Well, the Hamas-Ran Gaza Health Ministry says that more than 413 people have been killed [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=357.2s)]
*  overnight. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=364.72s)]
*  BBC Verify has been examining footage of the impact in the north and south of the territory. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  With more, here is my colleague Nick Beek. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel's airstrikes overnight were extensive and hit different targets across the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=373.04s)]
*  As you'd expect, there's a lot of video circulating. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  This is the first one we verified. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=381.52s)]
*  It's in the southern city of Ra'afah at the moment a strike happens and you can see smoke [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=383.68s)]
*  rising. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=389.44s)]
*  Worth pointing out that some of the destruction here will be from previous attacks. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=390.24s)]
*  There's also this photograph that the team have geo-located. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=395.12s)]
*  It's just round the corner again in Ra'afah and the design and shape of the building matches [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  what we've seen in that previous video. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=405.84s)]
*  There's also this footage from the north of Gaza at the Indonesian hospital. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=408.0s)]
*  We have blurred it because it's really, really graphic. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=414.16s)]
*  It appears to show a man carrying a girl who's either dead or unconscious. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=417.12s)]
*  And you see in a moment he brings her towards the steps of the hospital and we've matched [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=423.28s)]
*  this location to other videos taken previously from the hospital. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=427.84s)]
*  Worth pointing out that today one of the key things we're trying to do is checking that video [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=432.0s)]
*  being shared is in fact new. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=437.12s)]
*  We do that by taking screen grabs and then doing a reverse image search and seeing if [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=439.68s)]
*  anything matches footage that's been previously posted. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=445.36s)]
*  If there's no match, it's a strong sign that yes, it is a new video. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=449.6s)]
*  And all of this is helping us build a picture of these deadly Israeli strikes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=454.32s)]
*  Let's take you to the scene live at the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=461.12s)]
*  Of course, a recap that these Israeli strikes happened overnight. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  The Israeli military describing them as extensive strikes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  They say it was after talks to extend the ceasefire failed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=477.36s)]
*  And these are the largest wave of strikes since the start of the year. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=480.88s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office saying Israel will from now on act against Hamas [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=486.72s)]
*  with increasing military strength. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=492.72s)]
*  Accusing Hamas of repeatedly refusing to release the hostages. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=495.28s)]
*  Well, let's take you to Jerusalem where we can see relatives of those who've been held [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=499.28s)]
*  hostage and are still being held hostage. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel says 59 people, hostages still being held, some of them no longer alive. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=508.08s)]
*  These are the families of those. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=515.04s)]
*  They are actually protesting in Jerusalem. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=516.48s)]
*  We've had a statement from the hostage families accusing the Israeli government [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  of choosing to, I quote, give up hostages in Gaza as it launched those new strikes. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=524.8s)]
*  The group's now issued an emergency call, it says, and they've headed to Jerusalem to protest. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=530.4s)]
*  They believe that the hostages are in grave danger. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  In a post on X, the families wrote, there's nothing more urgent than this. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=539.6s)]
*  With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=543.36s)]
*  Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=547.36s)]
*  Let's show you the scene live as we look over the NASA hospital in Khan Yunis because, of course, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=553.84s)]
*  hospitals, according to the Red Cross, are now overwhelmed in Gaza in the wake of those [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  strikes overnight with hundreds of people injured. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=567.36s)]
*  But we've been speaking to agencies on the ground in the last couple of hours here on BBC News who [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  say they are really struggling to be able to treat people because already Gaza has been in [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  the midst of a humanitarian crisis with limited access to supplies and then now another wave of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=582.8s)]
*  casualties at a time which was already difficult for them. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  And the latest in terms of the numbers killed we are hearing is 413 people killed in those strikes. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  Hamas accusing Israel of attacking defenceless civilians, Hamas saying that mediators should [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=605.3599999999999s)]
*  hold Israel fully responsible for violating and overturning the ceasefire. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=611.76s)]
*  Well, we've been hearing from the Israeli Foreign Minister to hear, let's have a listen to what they [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=619.2s)]
*  had to say about those strikes. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=624.08s)]
*  As of this morning, Israel is operating with full force against the Hamas terrorist organization [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=626.48s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. We have reached this situation after the Hamas repeatedly refused proposal [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=633.12s)]
*  to extend ceasefire and to release our hostages. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=642.16s)]
*  Hamas rejected two concrete mediation proposals presented by the US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=648.56s)]
*  Israel agreed to these mediation proposals. Hamas refused them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=660.88s)]
*  The idea is striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip aiming to achieve the war's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=668.4s)]
*  objectives. From this point forward, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military intensity. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=675.6s)]
*  Well, let's hear from some analysts on what they think might come next. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=688.48s)]
*  Professor Yossi Meckelberg is a senior consulting fellow at the think tank Chatham House. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=694.16s)]
*  I think that Israel decided that the ceasefire is over. They also in doing what they've done [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=701.28s)]
*  overnight and probably this is going to continue of giving up on bringing back the hostages. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  And then we need to see, as you say, where we go from now. Are we going to see in the next few [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=716.88s)]
*  years, are we going to see in the intensification of this bombardment? And basically going back, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=722.08s)]
*  as we heard from the spokesperson from the foreign ministry, is that going back to the original [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=731.12s)]
*  objectives, as Israel said, of the war, which were complete elimination of Hamas, which goes against [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=738.4000000000001s)]
*  actually what he said in his first instance, that it was about actually Hamas refusing [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=746.32s)]
*  or rejecting a ceasefire or the phase two proposal. So that's exactly what the question [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  if this is only one day, one instance of this attack, or basically Israel says from now on [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=761.36s)]
*  we are going back to war. And we've seen and heard from Hamas that some of their [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  senior figures were killed in those strikes. How significant was that? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=775.2s)]
*  It is significant. It's also, it seems that those who were killed were more from the political wing, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=780.72s)]
*  which again is the message that Israel is going after not only destroying Hamas military capabilities, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  but also its ability to govern Gaza. And the question also, who is going to negotiate [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  the next phase, the release of the hostages, the rebuilding of Gaza, if it all, then the entire [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  leadership is eliminated. But again, one of the questions that we should ask ourselves is the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=813.44s)]
*  timing of this attack in a day that Prime Minister Netanyahu was supposed to give evidence in court [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  in his corruption trial, in a day that he was supposed to bring to the cabinet [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  his decision to fire the head of the internal security, the Shin Bet. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=833.76s)]
*  We just heard from the EU's aid chief who says the renewed escalation in Gaza, I quote, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=839.6s)]
*  must stop. Well earlier I spoke to freelance journalist Gada Oda, who is in Gaza City. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=847.2s)]
*  She told me about the reaction on the ground to events, including those latest evacuation orders [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=854.16s)]
*  which have been issued by Israel. Well, the Israeli military also announced that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=859.92s)]
*  evacuation orders starting from north to south along the border [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=866.48s)]
*  fence and the buffer zone around two kilometres away from the fence. So this is something terrible. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=873.92s)]
*  People start to evacuate from north because especially from [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=882.16s)]
*  Dayton, which is very close to the border fence and from Huzaa and Abassan in south, in east, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=886.7199999999999s)]
*  south of Khan Yunis. People, they feel like they don't have the reason to live peacefully. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  And we consider this operation as a pressure process for Hamas to release more hostages [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=906.56s)]
*  and to extend the faces of releasing the hostages. They are hoping that this military operation will [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  end soon and will not result in killing more people and they don't want to be displaced anymore. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=924.2399999999999s)]
*  Gada Oda on the ground in Gaza, a freelance journalist there. Of course, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  international journalists are not permitted to report from inside Gaza. That's from the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=936.24s)]
*  Israeli government there. Well, there's [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUCK5WEH_s&t=941.52s)]
