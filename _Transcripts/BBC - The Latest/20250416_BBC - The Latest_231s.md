Video Description: Victims of deposed Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's brutal rule still live in fear, seven months after her regime fell.
 
The BBC spoke with half a dozen victims of the Awami League’s program of forced disappearances who said they are still scared because their captors are free, still active members of the country’s military establishment.
 
Now, after anti-government protests forced Hasina out last year, the scale of the clandestine detention centres - and the treatment of those kept inside them for weeks, months and in some cases, years - has started coming to light.

# Inside Bangladesh’s secret prisons hidden in plain sight | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI)
*  I was blindfolded for nine months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=0.0s)]
*  They tortured me. My nose is still broken. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=5.0s)]
*  I was handcuffed on the backside, so two persons just taking me in these stairs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=10.0s)]
*  Even inside, I used to be blindfolded and handcuffed 24x7. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=16.0s)]
*  A glimpse into the dark side of Bangladesh. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=21.0s)]
*  Hundreds of prisons like this scattered across the country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=26.0s)]
*  Detainees languishing, telling similar stories, beaten, tortured and left in complete darkness. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=31.0s)]
*  You know, for years we've heard about these detention centres. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=42.0s)]
*  This is the first time we're actually taking a look at them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=47.0s)]
*  And just look at how tiny this one is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=50.0s)]
*  And it's still divided into seven different cells. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=53.0s)]
*  Look, I'll just come into this one to show you how small it is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm about five feet four inches tall and I can stand up straight in this particular one, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=61.0s)]
*  but I cannot extend my arms all the way out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=66.0s)]
*  But if you go just next door to this one over here, take a look. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=69.0s)]
*  I cannot stand up straight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=75.0s)]
*  I cannot extend my arms. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=78.0s)]
*  And imagine that people spent weeks, months or even years in these cells. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=80.0s)]
*  We've been given access to where this British-trained barrister, Mir Ahmed bin Qasim, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=87.0s)]
*  spent eight years of his life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=93.0s)]
*  This is what my husband was. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=96.0s)]
*  This was your cell? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=98.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=99.0s)]
*  Physically bruised and emotionally scarred. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=100.0s)]
*  There used to be a door here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=104.0s)]
*  There used to be a door. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=106.0s)]
*  It felt like being buried alive, being totally cut off from every outside world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=107.0s)]
*  It felt worse than death. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=112.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what it was. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=115.0s)]
*  It was meticulously designed to give the detainees a worse than death experience. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=117.0s)]
*  His freedom came only after Sheikh Hasina was deposed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=122.0s)]
*  Thousands of victims, of which the BBC has spoken to more than half a dozen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=128.0s)]
*  Who say they were forcibly disappeared. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=135.0s)]
*  Retaliation for their political dissent. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=138.0s)]
*  Investigators say the orders came from the top. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=141.0s)]
*  In every case we found that it was widespread and it was designed by the Prime Minister. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=145.0s)]
*  So the officers concerned, they stated that all the enforced death experience cases [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=151.0s)]
*  has been done with the approval or permission or order by the Prime Minister herself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=157.0s)]
*  Hasina ruled with an iron fist until anti-government protests forced her out last year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=165.0s)]
*  Now her political party says it had nothing to do with them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=172.0s)]
*  Security forces operated alone. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=177.0s)]
*  Forces that continue to serve. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=180.0s)]
*  Many victims may be free, but they still live in fear. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=183.0s)]
*  Attakur Rahman Russell, frightened his captors will find him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=188.0s)]
*  I fear now that even as I give this interview and talk about being taken by the security forces, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=194.0s)]
*  they might take me away again out of personal vengeance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=202.0s)]
*  The fear is always there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=206.0s)]
*  I live in constant fear. I always have to watch my back when I'm travelling. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=210.0s)]
*  A crucial test for Bangladesh's new but fragile democracy will be getting justice for victims. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=216.0s)]
*  So they no longer live in fear. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIgVrMaSesI&t=223.0s)]
