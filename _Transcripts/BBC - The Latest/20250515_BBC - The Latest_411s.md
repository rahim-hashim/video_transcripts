*  For those who've known only the shrinking ground of Gaza for the last 19 months. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=58.4s)]
*  Sama, nine years old with a brain tumour. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  What's it like in Gaza? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=70.64s)]
*  Horrible. No words can describe how much horrible it is like on all levels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=72.64s)]
*  This is a happy moment for these children and their parents. They've travelled all day. They've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=78.16s)]
*  come from a place of hunger and death. Now this helicopter is going to take them to a man where [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=83.75999999999999s)]

*  She wanted me to read a message. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  It is hard to imagine what these sights mean to eyes that have looked only on desolation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=108.0s)]
*  In the place they left, this. Carnage left by a different aircraft. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=120.72s)]
*  A hospital bombed by Israel. The CCTV camera capturing the moment of impact and aftermath. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=127.52s)]
*  An absolutely massive strike on EGH hospital. This is right in front of the emergency room. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=137.76s)]
*  The Israelis alleged the leader of Hamas was hiding in a bunker under the hospital. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=145.92s)]
*  28 people were killed, dozens wounded. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=151.28s)]
*  So standing outside the operating theatre you can see the damage behind me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=154.32s)]
*  It's not even possible to take any cases to theatre because it's too dangerous. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=158.56s)]
*  And the man, the families who've escaped for now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=163.04s)]
*  The horror of what's happening in Gaza. It is new and strange here, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=170.64s)]
*  but they will meet other Gazan evacuees who've already come. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=175.84s)]
*  Like Habiba Alaskari who was brought to Jordan in January with gangrene in two of her arms and a leg. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=183.28s)]
*  On the chopper to a man, I saw a child frightened and seriously ill. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=189.84s)]
*  This is Habiba today. A triple amputee. Doctors could not save her limbs, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=198.16s)]
*  but she's a determined child and adapting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=206.08s)]
*  Her mum Rana wants her someday to go home. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  To me, Gaza will always be beautiful, the most beautiful place on this earth, says Rana. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=214.56s)]
*  But home to war or peace, nobody knows. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's go live now to Jerusalem. Our correspondent Yolande Nel is there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Yolande, can we start with the strikes overnight? What more do we know? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  We have been hearing from the Palestinian Red Crescent that at least 36 bodies were taken to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=240.08s)]
*  hospitals in the south of the Gaza Strip. That's where there have been the most intense strikes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  in and around Qanunas overnight. We are also hearing that there were five killed in Jabalia [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=252.8s)]
*  in the north of the Strip, that three bodies were retrieved from a house in Gaza City as well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=260.24s)]
*  But really, we are told something like nine Israeli strikes have been reported in the Qanunas [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=265.84s)]
*  area and the main hospital there has been overwhelmed. The corridors are now crowded [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=273.35999999999996s)]
*  with casualties, this with a real severe shortage of medical supplies and medicines. At the same [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  time, the morgue there is full, local journalists are saying. We have not heard from the Israeli [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=288.96s)]
*  military specifically what it was targeting, but in general, it has been saying that in recent days [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=292.56s)]
*  with the intense bombardment we have seen of Gaza this week, it is going after Hamas, including [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=299.2s)]
*  Hamas figures and what it calls terrorist infrastructure. Yolande, what is this latest [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=304.64s)]
*  phase? What have the Israelis set out as their objectives with these strikes? These strikes have [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=312.48s)]
*  been taking place this week as President Trump has been continuing his visit to the region and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=320.0s)]
*  also as we have got ceasefire and hostage release talks taking place once again in Doha. The Israeli [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=326.32s)]
*  government has said that any talks that take place now will take place under fire. In terms of Israel's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=333.84s)]
*  military objectives, there has been a lot of reporting in the Israeli media that the head of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=340.08s)]
*  the Hamas military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of the assassinated leader of Hamas, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=345.04s)]
*  was killed in a strike on the Gaza European hospital, a particularly deadly strike there [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=352.56s)]
*  earlier this week. There has been no confirmation of that from Hamas or from the Israeli military. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=360.24s)]
*  We have also had Israel putting out new evacuation orders for parts of Gaza City that have caused a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  lot of panic. They affect an area where thousands of people are staying. They affect the Shifa [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=372.48s)]
*  hospital, the Islamic University, which is being used as a shelter, and schools being used as [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  shelters for displaced people as well in the western part of Gaza City. That has become [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=382.16s)]
*  crowded with people who have moved there from the east to flee from Israel's military offensives there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=387.12s)]
*  And the Israeli military put out a statement saying that it had intelligence about seven [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  figures from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, senior figures, it says, were operating in that area [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=397.6s)]
*  and telling people really that they should leave, civilians should leave for their own safety. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=404.56s)]
*  Jolande, thank you for that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-Kesk8j0M&t=409.44s)]
