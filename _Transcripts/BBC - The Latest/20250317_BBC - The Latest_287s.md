Video Description: Police in North Macedonia have detained 15 people after a fire at a nightclub killed at least 59 people and injured 155 others.
 
Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said the detainees will be questioned, adding that there are "grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption" linked to the fire.
 
Around 1,500 people were watching DNK, a popular hip-hop duo in the country, when a fire broke out at the Pulse club in Kocani, North Macedonia.
 
The fire started around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday when sparks from pyrotechnic devices hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material, Toskovski said.

*  and green hotel that you can see because this is now the site of a criminal investigation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  Quite apart from the fact that the venue went on fire and burned so fiercely, the police [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=87.75999999999999s)]

*  Why didn't the mayor send an inspection to check up on this club? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=115.12s)]
*  I only had one child, one, only one and they took it away from me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=119.36s)]
*  After a day of shock people gathered at a vigil on Kachorni's riverside to remember [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=125.96000000000001s)]

*  One year, two years older or younger than me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=137.0s)]
*  This is a very sad time for me still. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Ministers are promising an urgent investigation saying everyone who failed must be held to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=145.6s)]
*  account. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=150.28s)]
*  Police have already made multiple arrests including that of the nightclub's owner. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  People need to grieve but they also need answers and justice. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Guy Delaunay, BBC News, Kachorni. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=160.48s)]
*  Guy is at the scene of that nightclub fire and he sent us this update in the last hour. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=164.16s)]
*  The investigation is indeed underway and I'm here outside one of the main medical facilities [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  in Skopje, North Macedonia's capital. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  There are still dozens of people being treated here and in many other facilities across the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=176.88s)]
*  capital we've also seen people being flown out to neighbouring countries, so Turkey, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=182.2s)]
*  Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=188.48s)]
*  They've all been helping and we're getting more help coming in throughout the day. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=189.88s)]
*  But of course now people will be very much looking towards the criminal investigation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=194.2s)]
*  and the sort of action that the authorities are going to be taking. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=198.56s)]
*  When we were speaking to people in Kachorni last night at the candlelit vigil, they were [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=202.6s)]
*  saying to us, look, we've got seven days of national mourning but we need to see something [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  happening within those seven days. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Guy, you're outside the medical facility where many of those who were injured were treated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=215.88s)]
*  Just tell us more about who was at the nightclub, who were the victims. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=221.28s)]
*  Well the hospitals say that most of the victims were between the ages of 14 and 24. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=227.12s)]
*  So this event, it was a gig by a band called DNK, who are a popular band here in North Macedonia. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  It's actually a core of a duo but they get more live members for performances. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=239.68s)]
*  And going to a small town like Kachorni, what is now being referred to as an improvised [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=244.4s)]
*  nightclub by the local media here because it was a former carpet warehouse, but you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=249.68s)]
*  can imagine what a magnet that was for young people in a small town. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=253.6s)]
*  Just 25,000 people live in Kachorni and if we're looking at the numbers of dead and injured, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=258.52s)]
*  in total it's more than 250. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=264.24s)]
*  And this is what's really devastating about this whole incident, is that you look at a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=266.56s)]
*  town like Kachorni, imagine the scale of that loss for the people who live there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  Imagine how every single family in that town will have been touched by this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=276.0s)]
*  And the question of how you recover is almost inconceivable at the moment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  That's Guy Delaney there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxhJqaa2D5w&t=285.76000000000005s)]
