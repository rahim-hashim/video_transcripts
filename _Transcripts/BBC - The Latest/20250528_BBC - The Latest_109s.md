Video Description: Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has told Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky that Berlin will help Kyiv produce long-range missiles to defend itself from Russian attack.
 
"We want to talk about production and we will not publicly discuss details," he said, when asked by reporters in Berlin if Germany would supply Kyiv with its Taurus missiles.
 
Merz took office earlier this month, and promised increased German support for Ukraine, and said this week that there were "no longer" any range restrictions on weapons supplied by Kyiv's Western allies.

# German chancellor promises to help Ukraine produce long-range missiles | BBC News

*  Let's just remind you of what we've been seeing in Berlin. President Zelensky is there for the first time since Friedrich Merz became Germany's new chancellor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=0.0s)]
*  They've just had a press conference which we kept across. They talked about how focusing on further peace talks with Russia was part of their agenda, new sanctions against Moscow as well. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=9.0s)]
*  And also talk about endorsing Ukraine's right to conduct long-range missile strikes into Russian territory. That would align Germany with other Western allies. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=21.0s)]
*  But we were looking for some clarification around Germany's Taurus missiles. Mikey is still with me. We heard from Chancellor Merz. He said, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=31.0s)]
*  He said, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of sensitivity surrounding that. Zelensky does have a deep strike capability. He's got drones that have been conducting deep strikes for a while now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=50.0s)]
*  He's also got something called Long Neptune. That started off, Neptune started off as an anti-shipping missile, but they've advanced that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=59.0s)]
*  And it's now got a range of about a thousand kilometers. But what Taurus and Stormshadow give that what Zelensky's current organic deep strike capability doesn't have is the ability to have this bunker buster effect. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=67.0s)]
*  So what Taurus can do, what Stormshadow can do is it can target hardened facilities, commander control structures, for example. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=79.0s)]
*  So if Zelensky, through this deal, manages to get a bunker buster capability, he will be able to target commander control and logistics resupply, pushing that back further into Russian territory, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=86.0s)]
*  which will make it harder for Putin to be able to resupply any infantry movements in the occupied terrorist seats, for example. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=99.0s)]
*  Mikey, thanks so much. Dusey with us here on BBC News. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptKs2RqbaY&t=105.0s)]
