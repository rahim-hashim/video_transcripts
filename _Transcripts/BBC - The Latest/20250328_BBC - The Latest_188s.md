Video Description: A 7.7 magnitude earthquake - which the US Geological Survey says had an epicentre in central Myanmar - has also been felt in neighbouring countries, including Thailand where an unfinished high-rise has collapsed. 
 
But what do we mean when we say a 7.7 magnitude earthquake? 
 
BBC science reporter Esme Stallard explains that it's a measure of momentum and how much movement there has been in the top layer of the earth. 
 
Mynamar is a very tectonically active region - as it's situated at the junction of 4 tectonic plates. 
 
However the magnitude of the earthquake is unusual - the BBC believe the reason was because the earthquake occurred only 10 killometres below the earth's crust.

# Myanmar earthquake: What is a 7.7 magnitude earthquake? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE)
*  bit more detail about where it struck and the details. Our science reporter Esme Stallard is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=0.0s)]
*  in the newsroom with more. So Esme, talk us through what we know has happened. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=5.2s)]
*  So there was this 7.7 earthquake. What do we mean by that? That's a measure of momentum. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=10.56s)]
*  Effectively it's a measure of how much movement there has been in the top layer of the earth [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=15.52s)]
*  and what size has moved. So the earth's crust is split into lots of different plates and they're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=20.0s)]
*  all moving constantly. And my my is that the confluence of four of these plates and so it's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=25.2s)]
*  a very tectonically active region. So we had the main earthquake that occurred about 6.30 GMT [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=30.4s)]
*  around lunchtime local time and then there was a series of aftershocks which then occurred [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=37.04s)]
*  affecting the neighbouring countries. But I want to talk a little bit more about that tectonic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=42.08s)]
*  plate movement that I mentioned. I'm just going to show you this map here behind me which is from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=47.6s)]
*  the US Geological Survey and the dot here highlighted in blue was that first initial [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=52.08s)]
*  earthquake that I mentioned. But then what happens when you get that movement then settling is that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=58.08s)]
*  you get then these aftershocks. For example there was another one here just south just 10 minutes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=62.96s)]
*  later which occurred. Again that was very significant. It was more than six on that same [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=68.08s)]
*  scale. Now when I mentioned before those plates what we can see here is we can see a major red [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=73.28s)]
*  line coming down close to where the earthquakes occurred. That's a major fault line so that's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=78.56s)]
*  where some of that movement is happening. And the US Geological Survey says that the kind of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=83.92s)]
*  conditions or characteristics of this earthquake suggest that maybe some of that movement was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  occurring along that fault line. That's known as the Seagate Fault and it's named after the area [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=93.92s)]
*  local to it. And then either side you've got here the Indian Plate and then over here the Eurasian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=99.44s)]
*  Plate and they're also moving. And so this is why this area is very prone to earthquakes but the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=104.64s)]
*  sheer scale of it is quite unusual. The reason that we think it was so significant is that this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=110.48s)]
*  earthquake happened a very low area below the crust. It was only 10 kilometers down. It's a very shallow [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=115.68s)]
*  earthquake and that means when you get a lot of that movement between the plates it really has a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=122.64s)]
*  big effect on the surface. In terms of can we look at previous earthquakes? Can they indicate potentially [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=127.36s)]
*  the scale? When we look at other earthquakes of this size we have seen significant fatalities and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=133.6s)]
*  I think that is why it's such a concern for local authorities and rescue services at this time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=139.44s)]
*  There's also you know mentioned just there the concern about further aftershocks so we've seen [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=145.6s)]
*  some more. Those are the other orange dots here occurring so there is still the risk at this time [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=150.24s)]
*  that there will be further earthquakes felt. But you can understand considering the kind of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=155.44s)]
*  surrounding geology why this occurred. Esme thank you very much for that detail. Esme Stallard who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=160.16s)]
*  is our science reporter with detail of what we know about that 7.7 magnitude quake. As she was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=166.88s)]
*  saying the epicenter is in Myanmar and it is difficult to get information and pictures out [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=172.48s)]
*  because we know that power lines are down. Communication is difficult and also the fact that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=179.2s)]
*  it is under military control since the coup. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRUoTnENTPE&t=185.2s)]
