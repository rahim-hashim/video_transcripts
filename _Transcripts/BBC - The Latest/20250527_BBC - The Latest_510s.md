**BBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo)
*  Four children are among dozens of people who've been injured after a car ploughed into crowds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=0.0s)]
*  who'd been watching Liverpool's Premier League title parade. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=5.84s)]
*  In a news conference late last night, police said the incident in Liverpool's city centre [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=8.92s)]
*  was not being treated as terrorism. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=14.0s)]
*  A 53-year-old white British man from the local area has been arrested. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=16.04s)]
*  The Prime Minister described the scenes as appalling and thanked the emergency services [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=21.56s)]
*  for their swift response. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=26.44s)]
*  The collision happened just after six o'clock yesterday evening on Water Street, shortly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=28.78s)]
*  after the player's bus had passed through. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  Barry Caffrey has the latest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  Crowds of Liverpool fans had come out to celebrate, but the carnival turned into carnage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  A car was making its way along a closed road, a warning that what we are about to show you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  is distressing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=55.22s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=56.66s)]
*  With no idea of what's about to happen, people are still celebrating when suddenly out of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=59.66s)]
*  nowhere a car careers towards them and ploughs into the crowd, which is rose deep. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=64.86s)]
*  There was panic and chaos. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=71.22s)]
*  The vehicle just missed BBC reporter Matt Cole, who was there with his family. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=73.7s)]
*  We went from a moment of celebration down here, a moment of joy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=79.5s)]
*  I remember seeing my son had just seen his footballing hero, most hallow, lifting the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=83.18s)]
*  trophy in front of him. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=87.18s)]
*  He said it was the best day of his life, turned into perhaps not this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=88.18s)]
*  It came out of the blue. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=92.18s)]
*  At that time, this area was still closed to traffic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=93.18s)]
*  There were thousands of people here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=96.18s)]
*  It made no sense. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=98.18s)]
*  The moment you saw it, trying to register what you were seeing literally made no sense. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=100.18s)]
*  It was beeping. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=104.18s)]
*  As I cast my mind back, I remember that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=105.18s)]
*  I most vividly just remember the men shouting and banging and chasing and trying to stop. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  And at that point, we had no idea. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  We grabbed the children. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  We ran up. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  We ran left. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  I looked back afterwards. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  I could see a handful of people sitting, but I couldn't see any other casualties. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=118.66000000000001s)]
*  But because we had no idea what this was and my children were my priority, I grabbed them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  and we took off. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  This man also witnessed what happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=129.66s)]
*  I heard it accelerate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=133.14s)]
*  I heard it rev it's engine and it kind of accelerated a bit, kind of forward, kind of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=134.14s)]
*  further down the road. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=139.34s)]
*  And then suddenly it started accelerating in the opposite direction and it rammed into [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=140.34s)]
*  the actual ambulance itself. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=144.34s)]
*  Moments after the crash, this video shows people surrounding the car. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=146.84s)]
*  The mood of the crowd has turned to anger. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=151.06s)]
*  Some try to get into the vehicle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=153.98s)]
*  The back window is smashed as the police struggle to hold people back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  A number of people have been badly hurt. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=160.5s)]
*  Sadly, four of the injured were children who were enjoying the day with their friends [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=163.38s)]
*  and their families. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=167.38s)]
*  Twenty seven patients in total were taken to hospital by ambulance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=168.38s)]
*  And we believe two of those, including one of the children, have sustained serious injuries. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=172.38s)]
*  A 53-year-old white British man believed to be the driver of the vehicle and from the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=178.38s)]
*  Liverpool area has been arrested. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=183.18s)]
*  What I can tell you is that we believe this to be an isolated incident and we are not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  currently looking for anyone else in relation to it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  The incident is not being treated as terrorism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=197.3s)]
*  Liverpool Football Club have said, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=201.9s)]
*  with the incident. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=216.58s)]
*  It is not yet known why the incident happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=218.5s)]
*  Anyone with footage is being asked to come forward with any information and report it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  to the police. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  Barry Caffrey, BBC News. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=228.62s)]
*  Barry joins me now in the studio. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=233.06s)]
*  Incredibly disturbing incident there, Barry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=235.18s)]
*  Lots of questions still remain. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=238.22000000000003s)]
*  The Prime Minister, Kirstam, has been commenting on the scenes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=239.58s)]
*  He has, Mark. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=243.58s)]
*  He said that everyone, particularly children, should be able to celebrate their heroes without [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=244.58s)]
*  this type of horror. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  He said the city has a long and proud history of coming together through difficult times. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=250.9s)]
*  He said Liverpool stands together and the whole country, in fact, stands with Liverpool. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=255.86s)]
*  Just to remind people, the incident happened shortly after 6pm yesterday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=261.86s)]
*  The incident was reported to the Prime Minister yesterday evening. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=265.86s)]
*  Just to remind people, the incident happened shortly after 6pm yesterday evening when a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=270.86s)]
*  car collided into pedestrians on Water Street in Liverpool's city centre. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=276.14s)]
*  Of course, thousands of people have been there throughout the afternoon celebrating Liverpool [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  Football Club's victory parade for the Premier League, which was taking place. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=285.06s)]
*  The BBC understands that the collision happened around about 10 minutes after that time that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  the bus actually carrying the Liverpool Football Club players had passed through. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=294.94s)]
*  We had one eyewitness who said that we saw the car reverse and then accelerate into people, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=300.34s)]
*  moving through the crowd. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=306.34s)]
*  He described people scattered around like bowling pins and he said that the change in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=307.7s)]
*  the mood from what had been a really glorious, positive day to just hell on earth was how [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=312.38s)]
*  he described it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=317.46s)]
*  We know 27 people were taken to hospital. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=318.94s)]
*  Two people are in a serious condition, one child and one adult. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=322.18s)]
*  20 people were also treated at the scene, including four children. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=325.18s)]
*  We know a paramedic who was also on a bike was struck by this vehicle too. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  The Fire Service said that when the emergency services arrived, four people were actually [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=334.82000000000005s)]
*  underneath the vehicle, including one child. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=339.1s)]
*  The vehicle was then rapidly removed so those people could be treated. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  It's still not clear what actually happened or why this happened. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=346.22s)]
*  We do know that a 53-year-old man who is described as white and British, and we understand from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=350.06s)]
*  the greater Liverpool area, has been arrested. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=355.74s)]
*  Police say the incident though is not being treated as terrorism. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=358.86s)]
*  The emergency services were obviously on the scene quickly because they were already there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=364.5s)]
*  They were there in numbers for the parade anyway and they've been describing what they [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=368.22s)]
*  encountered. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=372.26s)]
*  They have and thousands of people had been there throughout the day. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=373.26s)]
*  We have heard from the emergency services in a late-night news conference which took [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  place last night. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=380.62s)]
*  We heard from David Kitchin, for example, who is from the North West Ambulance Service. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=382.26s)]
*  He said that everyone was very horrified and saddened by the events. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=386.14s)]
*  He said that paramedics, clinicians and other medical teams were really quick to support [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  and respond to what happened on Water Street in Liverpool. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=395.18s)]
*  Of course, we know that 27 patients were taken to hospital, two of them in a serious condition. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  We were awaiting a condition update. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=404.1s)]
*  We have had some tributes coming in over the past couple of hours overnight. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=406.3s)]
*  Ian Byrne, who is a local MP for Liverpool West Derby, said he is absolutely heartbroken [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=411.9s)]
*  by the scenes in Liverpool after what should have been the best of days. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=417.18s)]
*  He said his love and thoughts are with all those affected. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=420.7s)]
*  We've also heard from Manchester United, of course, Liverpool's historic rivals posting [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=423.98s)]
*  on social media offering their solidarity with Liverpool, saying our thoughts are with [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=429.3s)]
*  LFC and the city of Liverpool after the awful incident. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=434.3s)]
*  We're still awaiting a condition update on the two people who are in hospital with serious [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=438.86s)]
*  injuries but we haven't got that information just yet. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=444.3s)]
*  The front page is really talking about the horror and carnage of it all. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  Going forwards, what can we expect from the investigation and what's happening in Liverpool [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=452.62s)]
*  on the streets today? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=457.1s)]
*  Have they cleared up that street or what's the scene there? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=458.3s)]
*  So there's a section of Liverpool which is obviously closed off and cordoned off in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=461.1s)]
*  centre of Liverpool. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  The tent was certainly there last night. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=467.38s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's been removed yet this morning but you're right, it's on all of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  front pages. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=472.94s)]
*  All of the newspapers have been carrying this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=474.06s)]
*  I think it's going to be a very difficult day and a shocking day for Liverpool. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  We don't know whether there will be any sort of vigils or events like that but part of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=480.14s)]
*  the centre of Liverpool around Water Street is all cordoned off and closed at the moment. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=485.34s)]
*  Well Barry, I know you're going to be keeping an eye on that for us for the rest of the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=489.74s)]
*  day so thank you for that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIxNSmhloo&t=492.94s)]
