Video Description: President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural address on 20 January will take place indoors due to dangerously cold weather being forecast next week in Washington, he has confirmed.
 
The address, as well as other speeches, will now take place inside the US Capitol's rotunda, rather than outside the building.
 
The inaugural parade will also be held indoors at Washington's Capitol One Arena, along with all three inaugural balls.
 
The last president to be sworn-in indoors was Ronald Reagan in 1985, when cold weather also plagued the US Capitol.

*  the US Capitol Rotunda and the inauguration parade that we also see may potentially be held inside [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Washington's Capitol One Sports Arena. Donald Trump's transition team is being contacted. Let's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=27.84s)]
*  go straight to Washington straight for more on this breaking news. Nomiye Iqbal is there for us [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=34.64s)]
*  and Nomiye this is hugely unusual but terrible temperatures expected there for Monday so a last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=39.84s)]
*  minute switch of plans. A very very last minute switch of plans. Yes just to repeat there Donald [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Trump has tweeted or put on his social media that this is an order to keep people safe. He says [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=55.28s)]
*  everyone will be happy and basically there is this arctic blast that is sweeping the country. I'm just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  looking at the forecast now and it is braced to be dangerously cold on Monday. Temperatures are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=69.84s)]
*  predicted to not get much above 20 degrees Fahrenheit and then you're going to have all the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  howling cold winds and so it will very much feel like in the single digits. Yes it is very unusual [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=79.92s)]
*  the last time that this happened when the inauguration was moved inside was Ronald Reagan's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=86.8s)]
*  in 1985. Donald Trump does mention that in his social media post. So exactly you know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=92.0s)]
*  you know it'll be obviously hugely stressful I imagine for organizers to to get on top of that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  but yes Donald Trump has confirmed that the inauguration will take place indoors on Monday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=105.84s)]
*  I was reading only the last couple of days because increasing there's been a lot of attention [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=112.0s)]
*  about this inauguration as the temperatures drop and looking at the history books it was William [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Harrison of course back in 1841 the shortest presidency because he died a month after the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  inauguration with a very similar thing freezing temperatures. He stood there for a couple of hours [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=130.32s)]
*  without a coat without a hat and then caught pneumonia. So that is what the history books [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=135.12s)]
*  tell us. In terms of Donald Trump he has apparently been talking on social media saying he's ordered [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=140.72s)]
*  the inauguration address to be delivered inside the Capitol rotunda but also saying I will join [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=147.36s)]
*  the crowds at Capitol One after my swearing in. You touched on it though I mean in terms of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=152.88s)]
*  organization it is a logistical nightmare isn't it? It really is I mean at first when we heard [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=159.04s)]
*  that there were rumors that the inauguration could move indoors at first I thought could it be inside [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=166.64s)]
*  the White House could could it take place inside the White House and if you're the moving company [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=172.72s)]
*  that's that's one heck of a nightmare isn't it because you don't really have much time [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=177.12s)]
*  to move Joe Biden stuff out and then to move Donald Trump's in but as you mentioned there it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  is inside the Capitol the rotunda and I was here for the Joe Biden inauguration four years ago and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=184.88s)]
*  that was freezing. It's always really cold but it is predicted to be much colder. I think it will be [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=192.48s)]
*  even colder than it was during Barack Obama's inauguration. I wasn't here for that but that was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=199.2s)]
*  in 2009 and the high temperatures was 30 degrees Fahrenheit the low 19 and there were wind chills [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=203.76s)]
*  that were you know that were unbearable and so yes this decision couldn't have been taken lightly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=210.96s)]
*  I imagine but it's you know quite something for this to happen just just a few days before the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=219.36s)]
*  inauguration takes place. It really is because it's not just the incoming president that those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=224.56s)]
*  organizers have to worry about it's all those dignitaries and guests and world leaders that now [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=229.84s)]
*  have to be taken to a separate place so I'm sure more of those details will emerge over the next [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=234.96s)]
*  while that news is only just broken. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtXCDJGkoU&t=240.8s)]
