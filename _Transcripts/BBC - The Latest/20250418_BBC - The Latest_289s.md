Video Description: Hamas has formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire offer, saying it is prepared to immediately negotiate a deal that would see the release of all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and the release of Palestinian prisoners.

In a video statement, Hamas's chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said: "We will not accept partial deals that serve [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's political agenda."

Fifty-nine hostages remain in captivity and 24 are thought to be alive. Israel's latest offer involved a 45-day ceasefire in return for the release of 10 hostages.

Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said it was time "to open the gates of hell" on Hamas.

*  day since Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza March the 18th and really a couple [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  of weeks before that we were meant to have entered into phase two of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=72.8s)]
*  negotiations. Now Israel at that time proposed an extension along with the US [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=76.56s)]
*  Hamas rejected it and then Israel resumed its bombing having stopped any [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=81.2s)]
*  aid getting into Gaza from the beginning of March so really since then since over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=85.76s)]
*  the last month the situation has been daily nightly airstrikes by Israel local [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=89.88s)]
*  health officials Hamas have health officials on the ground say more than [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=96.44s)]
*  1,600 people have been died have died in that period of time and the UN says that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=99.56s)]
*  well practically half a million people have been displaced partly by having to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  move from their houses being destroyed but also by these what Israel calls [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=110.96s)]
*  evacuation orders what UN calls displacement orders by Israel asking [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=116.16s)]
*  them to move towards the coast particularly in the south now in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=120.08s)]
*  last few days we've also seen some strikes in those areas where these [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  civilians have been moving to particularly these tented camps near [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=127.96s)]
*  Khan Eunis on the just in from the coast and certainly the children's agency the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=132.56s)]
*  UN Children's Agency says some of the images we've seen from children dying in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=139.16s)]
*  some of those strikes appearing to die in those strikes should shock us all to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  the core so several dozen casualties per night Israel saying it's targeting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=147.68s)]
*  terrorists naming some of those it's targeted particularly one individual [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=152.76s)]
*  earlier this week who Israel says was Hamas main arms smuggler in terms of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=157.4s)]
*  getting their munitions into into the strip but even though Israel Matthew is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=163.36s)]
*  occupying around 30% of Gaza now on the ground there isn't actually much on the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  ground fighting Hamas either through a lack of capacity or through some sort of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=174.16s)]
*  strategic decision and not really engaging very much with the Israelis on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  the ground all this this all these deaths are happening through air strikes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=182.92s)]
*  now Israel says it takes every kind of mitigation it can in terms of precision [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  munitions intelligence air surveillance all that kind of thing but still the UN [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  agencies are saying that this is now probably the worst humanitarian failure [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=196.72s)]
*  of this generation and and the in the meantime there's no aid of at all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=201.32s)]
*  getting into the strip Gary will have more on that particular thought in a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=206.68s)]
*  moment or two a quick brief final thought because a couple of months ago [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=211.12s)]
*  there's a real push from the US administration now of course they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=213.84s)]
*  dealing with Ukraine we've been covering that on the program there's trade issues [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=217.4s)]
*  there's Iran there's deportations does it feel where you are that the focus [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=220.88s)]
*  still is very much on that situation there I don't think people feel that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=226.0s)]
*  there's as much focus here as there was I mean if you think of the simple fact [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=234.36s)]
*  that Steve Witkoff the president's envoy to the Middle East is also the envoy for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=238.84s)]
*  Ukraine he's also the envoy for the Iran talks Iran talks this weekend in Rome [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=242.8s)]
*  we've had the Paris talks on Ukraine this week it feels a little bit like the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=247.32s)]
*  US the attention of the US has moved away from this in the intractability and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=252.36s)]
*  the fact that there's no there's no nothing on the table that either side [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=256.92s)]
*  are going to come together on in particular and how this war ends is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=260.76s)]
*  frankly anyone's guess because no one knows what will come afterwards [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel insists on the complete destruction and disarmament of Hamas [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=270.68s)]
*  Hamas is still holding on to those hostages it's really it's only bargaining [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=274.76s)]
*  chip in that sense and there are 59 of those 24 who are said to be alive so [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=279.72s)]
*  we're in a we're in a standoff at the moment in the meantime a lot of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  civilians are suffering [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCTeJ2CNzM&t=287.44000000000005s)]
