# What was Israel targeting inside Iran? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE)
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is breaking our security. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=5.0s)]
*  We need to expand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=8.0s)]
*  As a military strategic plan, a former plan, you don't want politicians telegraphing what your next moves are going to be. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=9.0s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=16.0s)]
*  A peacekeeping force does not exist with a ceasefire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=21.0s)]
*  Israel is continuing its airstrikes on Iranian military targets following its barrage of rockets overnight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=31.0s)]
*  Several of Iran's military leaders and six of the nation's top nuclear scientists were killed, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=38.0s)]
*  with state television reporting that civilians, including children, are among the dead. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=44.0s)]
*  While the operation, called Rising Lion, targeted Iran's nuclear sites and also the capital Tehran, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=49.0s)]
*  killing, among others, the leader of Iran's most elite military unit, the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=55.0s)]
*  Iranian state media say that 78 people, including children, were killed in Tehran alone. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=63.0s)]
*  The figure has not been independently verified and of course we'll bring more on that as and when we get it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=69.0s)]
*  Now in a video statement, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his country has launched [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=75.0s)]
*  Operation Rising Lion to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, we can cross over to speak to the security briefs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=87.0s)]
*  Mikey Kaye, former senior officer, assault helicopter pilot in the British military, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=90.0s)]
*  joining us live from France. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=95.0s)]
*  Of course, this has happened so quickly we didn't even get time to get you into the studio, Mikey, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=98.0s)]
*  so it's good to see you remotely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=103.0s)]
*  Just when it comes to what was targeted by the IDF, by Israel inside Iran, talk us through it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah, hi, Kasha. It's a hybrid target set, if you like. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=112.0s)]
*  Not an unsurprising one in terms of the IDF's objective to ameliorate or atrit or degrade Iran's nuclear aspirations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=116.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at this slide, please. Let's go slide on the target map. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=126.0s)]
*  Not an unsurprising target set there, if you like. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=130.0s)]
*  You've got some military bases out to the left or to the west of Iran on the Iraqi border. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=133.0s)]
*  You've got Tehran in yellow at the center top there and around the center of the screen you've got Natanz. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=139.0s)]
*  Let's just have a quick look at those. I think let's start off with Tehran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=145.0s)]
*  This is interesting for me. It's a target set that involved high value, high value targets, HVTs, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=149.0s)]
*  we call them in the military, leadership inside the Iranian Guard Corps. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=155.0s)]
*  You alluded to it earlier, but it was the chief of the IRGC, which is Iran's most prominent military capability. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=159.0s)]
*  Let's go slide. Let's take a look at this individual. This is Hossein Salami. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=165.0s)]
*  He is the IRGC Guard's chief, killed in an airstrike. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=170.0s)]
*  So he's literally a massively important person when it comes to military planning inside Iran. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=175.0s)]
*  Additionally to him, the chief of the Iranian Air Forces, if you like, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=181.0s)]
*  regarded as the architect of the Iranian Shahed drone program. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=184.0s)]
*  He was also targeted and assassinated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=188.0s)]
*  And what's really important about the Shahed drone program, Kashia, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=191.0s)]
*  is it's basically the drone program that's come to prominence with Iran selling it to Putin and Russia. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=195.0s)]
*  And the Shahed has been used extensively to attack Ukrainian cities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=201.0s)]
*  So that individual has also gone. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=205.0s)]
*  And then other individuals that were targeted, high value targets regarded by the IDF, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=207.0s)]
*  were nuclear scientists in and around the Tehran region. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, if we look in terms of infrastructure, can you just go back to slide, please, on the map? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=216.0s)]
*  We'll look at Natanz, which is pretty much center of Iran. It's the red dot there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=220.0s)]
*  That is effectively the epicenter of Iran's main enrichment facility. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=224.0s)]
*  Now, this was struck and we now have what's called a BDA assessment, bomb damage assessment, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=230.0s)]
*  which is a satellite image which shows where Natanz was struck. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=235.0s)]
*  Let's go slide on that, please. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=238.0s)]
*  Four areas you can see basically across the facility. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=240.0s)]
*  Reports from the IAEA, which is the International Atomic Energy Agency, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=244.0s)]
*  indicate that the nuclear facility was severely damaged in the strike, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=248.0s)]
*  although the actual specifics and details of where we can see those areas of destruction, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=252.0s)]
*  they need to be interrogated a little bit more to work out what those areas do inside the facility. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=260.0s)]
*  Let's obviously go, sorry, let's go back slide again to the map, please. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=266.0s)]
*  On the left-hand side of the map now, up towards the Iraqi border, Tabriz, Pirin Shah and Khamanshah, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=269.0s)]
*  they're target sets that are associated with Iranian military capability, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=275.0s)]
*  likely ballistic missile facilities and radar sites, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=282.0s)]
*  which the IAEA also targeted Qashr in October last year after Iran launched a massive ballistic missile and drone attack [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=285.0s)]
*  over 180 projectiles in October. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=293.0s)]
*  So I think the culmination of all of this information is that, Qashr, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=296.0s)]
*  given that Iran relies on engines from North Korea for its ballistic missile program, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=300.0s)]
*  it relies on sodium percolate from China, sodium percolate is the chemical that's used for the solid fuel propellant [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=305.0s)]
*  that goes or propels the ballistic missiles. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=311.0s)]
*  This will hurt Iran in a big way and it's not going to be able to redevelop and re-energize that ballistic missile program anytime soon, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=314.0s)]
*  although it won't be through lack of trying. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=322.0s)]
*  Indeed, and so that, Mikey, was the damage done when it comes to the IDF and its attack. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=325.0s)]
*  Just talk us through how this attack was launched. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=330.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't think this operation should be underestimated. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=334.0s)]
*  Indications suggest over 200 Israeli Defense Force aircraft in five waves of strikes, including, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=340.0s)]
*  and we've spoken about this on the security brief before, the F-35 fighter, which has stealth capability. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=347.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at the F-35. We've talked about it before on the security brief. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=354.0s)]
*  The IDF has just under 40 of these. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=358.0s)]
*  They're about 100 mil a unit, a pot for an aircraft. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=361.0s)]
*  But what's important about these for this particular operation is it's got what's called a low RCS cacher, a radar cross-section. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=364.0s)]
*  So it basically allows the F-35 to get closer to the target with a reduced radar cross-section in order to improve the success of the target, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=371.0s)]
*  especially if that target is a surface-to-air missile system, for example. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=379.0s)]
*  Other likely aircraft within these packages, these five waves, are the F-15 and the F-16. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=383.0s)]
*  All of these aircraft, incidentally, are supplied by the U.S. to Israel. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=389.0s)]
*  And the F-15 and F-16, they can carry a cruise missile capability. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=394.0s)]
*  What that gives them cacher is the ability to deep strike from far away, again, reducing the risk on the pilots and the aircraft [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=398.0s)]
*  and increasing the probability of success on those strikes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=405.0s)]
*  And they'll be going after Iran's surface-to-air missile systems, a layered surface-to-air missile system, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=408.0s)]
*  not too indifferent to the Iron Dome, but not as capable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=413.0s)]
*  So differing aircraft into capability waves from what's called SEAD, suppression of enemy air defense, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=417.0s)]
*  which gets rid of all the surface-to-air missiles, and then in come the other jets with the cruise missile capability [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=423.0s)]
*  or offensive strike capability to be able to clear the way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=429.0s)]
*  So that's effectively the way that it was conducted. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=432.0s)]
*  Mikey, as we talk, I'm just keeping an eye on Israel's televised briefing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=434.0s)]
*  They're saying that, an official, they're saying that these strikes were due to incoming Iran attacks. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=439.0s)]
*  So just align there and we'll keep an eye on it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=445.0s)]
*  But when it comes to Iran itself, they also have some form of layered protection system to protect themselves from airstrikes from Israel. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do. It's tiered, it's layered, it's tiered a little bit like Iron Dome. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=456.0s)]
*  It's nowhere near as capable as Iron Dome. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=460.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at the major component of that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=462.0s)]
*  Let's go slide. This is the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=464.0s)]
*  There'll be no surprise to hear that that is designed and developed and supplied by Russia. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=469.0s)]
*  That goes out to about 200 kilometers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=473.0s)]
*  And then you have a middle system called tactical Hunter. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=475.0s)]
*  That's out to about 120 kilometers that the Iranians use. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=478.0s)]
*  And then the innermost system is the Korad 15 and that's out to about 75 kilometers. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=481.0s)]
*  So they do have a tiered layered defense. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=486.0s)]
*  And again, that's what those F-35s and the suppression of enemy air defense, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=488.0s)]
*  their main objective would have been to try and target and identify and take those out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=491.0s)]
*  And Mikey, just talk us through the route that the IDF jets take. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was looking at Flight 24 and this is quite fascinating. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=500.0s)]
*  Let's go slide and look at a little bit of the geography of the area. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=504.0s)]
*  On this slide on the left-hand side of the screen, you can see Israel in between Israel and Iran, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=508.0s)]
*  which is in the white on the center and right of the screen. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=514.0s)]
*  You've got Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=516.0s)]
*  What would make most sense to me, Kashir, in terms of A, the path of least resistance [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=519.0s)]
*  and the most direct route would be across Iraqi airspace and into Iran. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=523.0s)]
*  I think what's really interesting is if we can go to a slide of the flight radar map and the software. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=528.0s)]
*  This is it here. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=534.0s)]
*  Hopefully this will, is it brilliant? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=535.0s)]
*  Okay, hopefully this will move in a moment. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=538.0s)]
*  But if it doesn't, what you can see here is basically Iraqi airspace. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=541.0s)]
*  You've got Baghdad in the center of the screen there. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=547.0s)]
*  And then Iranian airspace was completely shut down and cleared rapidly after the operation started. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=549.0s)]
*  So to me, the fact that Iraqi airspace was shut down and cleared means that that would be a viable option [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=557.0s)]
*  for the IDF to use in terms of striking Iran. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=563.0s)]
*  And just so people, just so the viewers know, the aircraft that you can see, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=566.0s)]
*  if we just go back to that slide, please, back slide. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=570.0s)]
*  These basically are civilian air traffic. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=572.0s)]
*  They're airliners. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=574.0s)]
*  All have what's called a transponder, which has a four-digit code that civilian air traffic is required to basically put up. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=576.0s)]
*  It will be given to them by air traffic. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=583.0s)]
*  And secondary surveillance radar will see each one of those. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=585.0s)]
*  So basically this software can see every single aircraft that's airborne. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=587.0s)]
*  And you can see right in the middle of that screen there that Iran and Iraq were cleared. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=591.0s)]
*  And obviously that's a good thing, Kashir, when it comes to the confliction and the reduction of risk on civilian air traffic [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=595.0s)]
*  when you've got military activity in the area. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=601.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's staggering when you look at it like that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=602.0s)]
*  It's completely cleared. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=604.0s)]
*  Now, just this week, the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency said that Iran had failed to comply [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=605.0s)]
*  with its nonproliferation obligations for the first time in two decades. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=611.0s)]
*  Mikey, could that be what prompted this strike or has it been in the planning for quite some time? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=615.0s)]
*  Kashir, I think the answer to that is a combination of both. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=621.0s)]
*  So, you know, we've seen the negotiations going on between the U.S. and Iran and contingency planning or comp planning, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=624.0s)]
*  as we call it in the military. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=633.0s)]
*  That will be required because behind every soft power negotiation, you need a hard power big stick. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=634.0s)]
*  And that's what effectively the U.S. would have been planning for. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=640.0s)]
*  That's what Netanyahu administration would have been planning for for a long time. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=643.0s)]
*  What would they be planning? What would they be looking at? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=648.0s)]
*  Let's just take a look at a slide and look at Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=650.0s)]
*  As you can see, they're quite extensive and they're quite spread over Iran. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=653.0s)]
*  But, you know, an operation like this, looking at those sites in Iran is a massive amount of detailed planning. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=657.0s)]
*  We can see the Natanz, which was targeted on this airstrike. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=664.0s)]
*  But interesting, interesting above that in green, you got Fordow. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=668.0s)]
*  That's a secondary enrichment site that is more fortified, that has more more service to our missile systems around it, making it hard to penetrate. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=671.0s)]
*  You've then to the left of that in yellow, you've got Iraq. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=680.0s)]
*  That's basically it's a water facility used to cool reactors. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=684.0s)]
*  But also as a byproduct of that cooling, you get plutonium and that can be weaponized as well. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=689.0s)]
*  And then just interestingly down into the the bottom left of Iran, you can see that red dot Bashir. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=695.0s)]
*  That is Iran's only nuclear power plant that is currently in use. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=700.0s)]
*  And that uses not enriched uranium from Iran, but it uses enriched uranium from Russia. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=705.0s)]
*  So all these areas will have been scrutinized heavily by IDF military intelligence, by planners, also the readiness states of capability. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=711.0s)]
*  They will have also been prescribed. So if a trigger mechanism was initiated, the plan was set. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=719.0s)]
*  So and just when it comes to Israel, they say that they have never officially claimed to have nuclear weapons, although it's understood that they do. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=724.0s)]
*  Iran has been building its program for decades. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=735.0s)]
*  Mikey, how far off are they and what actually constitutes a nuclear weapon? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=740.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's start. Let's just unpack that a little bit. Let's start with Israel. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=746.0s)]
*  There is very little transparency on Israel's nuclear capability. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=750.0s)]
*  It does not confirm and it does not deny the existence of a nuclear arsenal. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=754.0s)]
*  But it is widely believed that Israel does possess a nuclear capability for sure. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=758.0s)]
*  What it looks like in numbers. That's uncertain in terms of delivery systems. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=763.0s)]
*  The idea, the idea does have a capability very, very quickly. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=767.0s)]
*  What constitutes a nuclear weapon? Enriched uranium up to 90 percent, a warhead and a delivery system such as a ballistic missile or an aircraft. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=772.0s)]
*  Combine those three and then you have an issue. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9x64kJ3jxE&t=781.0s)]
