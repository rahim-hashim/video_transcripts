# Split Fiction director Josef Fares says Hazelight can 'do better' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E)
*  I'm really excited what we're doing here next and we feel, to be honest, that we can do better. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=0.0s)]
*  We just feel like, oh, people are liking this so much but we know we can do better. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=4.32s)]
*  Hi, I'm Joseph Ares, game director at Hazelight and our latest game is Split Fiction. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I've only played it six too but I've seen a bit of the gameplay for Split Fiction. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=20.96s)]
*  Who comes up with the crazy ideas? Some of the concepts are just so creative and mental. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=25.28s)]
*  I often say at Hazelight we f*** it up without f***ing up. There's a special, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=31.68s)]
*  you know, type of creative environment here that lets everybody just go crazy. You know, passionate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=36.8s)]
*  bunch of people just going totally nuts and I'm so proud of like a kind of like a mentality of what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=42.72s)]
*  Hazelight is today. It's like we have no limits. It's like we're creatively free. So I would say [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=50.8s)]
*  it's such a joy to be here at the studio. For example, the pigs that fart rainbows as they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  fly. What's that all about? I mean, that was a very funny thing. It started like, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=63.36s)]
*  because we have this thing we call Freaky Week where we test all these different ideas and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  try out stuff that we can use in the game. What we call side stories that are literally like side [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=76.55999999999999s)]
*  content you find on the way and there are stories that they have written. It started out like having [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  pigs and then that in combination with the story that they become like sausages in the end and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=86.24s)]
*  you actually play that because that's also the way of like Zoe realizing how sausages were made. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  It just fitted so well, but it's part of like the creative platform we have here. It's so broad, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=100.96s)]
*  we can test everything. You have to understand, you know, there's just me and the team here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=108.96s)]
*  So there's not like different layers of, you know, stuff it has to go through. We just talk [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=114.0s)]
*  about it and then when we like it, it's in the game. The twists and turns. I'm still not over [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  killing the elephant in It Takes Two. I think I almost cried at that point. It was, oh my god. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=124.4s)]
*  But like, yeah, do you always know the end product when you're developing it or is it just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  whatever happens happens and we end up with a product? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=137.36s)]
*  No, it's for sure. The cutesy scene in general was planned from the beginning. That was part of the, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=140.32s)]
*  when I told the storyboards in the beginning, it was part of like the beats that were there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=145.52s)]
*  But to be honest, it was way worse in the beginning. So we kind of took it back a little [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=150.88s)]
*  bit because it felt too much. But on the other hand, sometimes I compare it to the scene in A [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Way Out where you torture a guy with 20 different tools. You can shoot him in the leg and like, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, do hit him in the face. Nobody cared, but everybody cared about a stuffed animal that is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=164.32s)]
*  not alive. It's quite interesting. But it's actually funny how for me, it's dark humor is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  actually the characters and it takes to like Cody and Mae going to that extreme because they [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=174.72s)]
*  are so full of themselves. They don't realize what they have done to their daughters. It was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  a good way also from a story perspective, like how far they have gone in their, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=184.72s)]
*  parenthood. And we speak a lot about creativity with the games. Do you think more games and more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=189.44s)]
*  developers should have a bit, you know, a bit more creativity because we've had a lot of, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=195.76s)]
*  especially in the last 10 years, games that have just copied a sort of the same old same old. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=201.6s)]
*  Do you think we need to see more creativity in the games industry? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=206.88s)]
*  Okay. I don't think the creativity is the problem in this. I think it's sometimes what could [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  potentially be is that stick with your vision. Don't, you know, don't fear that someone will [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=215.92s)]
*  not like this or not like that. I think actually at the end of the day, we have extremely talented [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  people out there, but I'm afraid that we know, you know, we need someone that's that is trusting [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=226.24s)]
*  it and making sure it's happening and making sure it's a clear vision about it. And we need also a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  publisher supporting it. So it's a collaborative experience. It needs to be a great publish and a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=237.28s)]
*  great developer developer knowing a clear vision, what they want and also sticking with it and, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  and not changing it. And then a publisher that can support that. So I think it's more of an approach, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=246.96s)]
*  how to work than that. There's a lack of creativity out there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=252.08s)]
*  Okay. And in terms of you've hit 1 million sales on split fiction, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=255.84s)]
*  has it performed better than you expected? I know it takes two. There was massive hype, especially on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=260.0s)]
*  social media, like TikTok, Instagram reels. Yeah. But yeah, it definitely exceeded more. I mean, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=265.2s)]
*  we're talking about like 1 million sales in the first 48 hours. We're seeing extremely good [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=272.24s)]
*  numbers on Steam. We have like a user score on Steam. There's like 90 over 98%, which is ridiculous. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=278.16s)]
*  I mean, that's amazing. To be honest, like, it's always nice when you make something and it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  resonates with people, you know, like the players out there. I mean, but to be honest, we are now [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=291.68s)]
*  focused on the next thing. I'm super passionate what we're doing next. We already started. So I'm [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=298.72s)]
*  really excited what we're doing here next. And we feel, to be honest, like we can do better. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=303.76s)]
*  We just feel like, oh, people are liking this so much, but we know we can do better. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=308.56s)]
*  You can do better than 90 plus, whatever the rating is on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=312.96s)]
*  Yes, yes, we can. Of course. Yeah. We just started, man. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=316.56s)]
*  Can you give us a hint about what's to come? I can't because it's way too early. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=319.76s)]
*  But what I can say is that we have started. And why do you think the game has resonated so much? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=325.28s)]
*  I was on the street here in Birmingham talking to people and they were like, you know, you don't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=332.64s)]
*  have many co-op games like this where you just get together with your pals on the sofa and you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  just play with them. Do you think that's why it's done so well? Part of it? Yes. I think there's a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=343.84s)]
*  lot of things I have to be clear. What Hazlitt is doing, you know, some people are saying, oh, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  they're bringing back couch co-op in a sense. We are. But in a sense, we are create our own things. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  Because the old couch co-op was senior play games that you could play in couch. They were never [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=359.84s)]
*  designed and written from the beginning as couch co-op. I think the reason why our games are very [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=364.08s)]
*  popular is because they are literally designed and written to be co-op only, which means we're [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  focusing on that specific thing totally, which means that we can take everything to the next level [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=373.76s)]
*  because we're sticking to the vision what we believe in. So what I said before, like even [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  like in the first way out, there were talks like, shouldn't we have an AI control character? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=386.32s)]
*  Should we have senior player? But no, stick with the vision, go with it. And I think if you really [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  love what you do, people will love it as well. And that's, I think, one of the reasons because [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  people are feeling the passion and what we're doing here. I think that's one of the key things, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=399.84s)]
*  actually. And also it's a very like a unique game. It feels fresh to play. It feels different. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  The variety, the pacing, everything feels just nice. Is there a lot of pressure on you with the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  next product to become even more innovative? Not really. I mean, there's always like people [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=414.48s)]
*  talked about like after it takes two, how that would feel. Do you feel any pressure? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=422.16s)]
*  I mean, of course, a little bit game winning game of the year and all that. Of course, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=426.8s)]
*  it does something. But then to the day, you have to go back to what really ticks, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=430.0s)]
*  why you love game and that going inwards. And that's what I trust a lot. And that's what I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=437.12s)]
*  communicate to the team. And that's what we love to do here. And also know. And a lot of the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=441.76s)]
*  people online have been saying, you know, we need more co-op games like you're doing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=448.0s)]
*  Do you want more developers to look at what you're doing? And well, you don't want competitors, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=453.76s)]
*  obviously, but maybe you've started a trend. I mean, look, I don't say that's competitors. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=458.64s)]
*  I would love more co-op games out there. That's what I want to play. I often go what I want to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=464.8s)]
*  play. I would love for it to happen. And now I actually think it's starting to happen when [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=469.76s)]
*  people are seeing how much they love this kind of game and the kind of success they're having with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=474.4s)]
*  the audience. I would love that to happen. I mean, even if they don't can come up to the level where [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=479.92s)]
*  I mean, we have obviously become the best in the world at this doesn't matter. They don't have to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=484.64s)]
*  be as good as our games. I think people will still play them because they want to play these [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  types of game. And these types of games are resonating a lot with younger audiences. Audiences [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=493.12s)]
*  we cover here in the UK. Why do you think it's particularly prominent among your 16 to 24 year [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=499.04s)]
*  olds? A lot of people we get feedback from are not that young. I just think they resonate with [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=504.8s)]
*  people that love video games. I mean, I'm not entirely sure it's only young people, but I [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  haven't looked at it from a number of perspective. I think they because it's just pure fun. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=513.6s)]
*  So it's been widely tipped for a nomination for Game of the Year again. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=520.08s)]
*  Are you thinking about that? Or are you not letting it get to you? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, there's obviously there's there's been a lot of talk about Game of the Year contender. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=530.48s)]
*  Look, it's always nice. It's always nice to get the recognition. And we'd be nice if we were [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=535.44s)]
*  nominated. But to be honest, if GTA comes out, it's going to be a tough one to win. And I'm not [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  expecting us to win again. If we would, that would be absolutely amazing, obviously. But it's nothing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=544.16s)]
*  that again comes in my head or my way would be super nice. But who knows. But here's the thing, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, you know, when every time when a game is out, I'm like, OK, fine, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=555.44s)]
*  it were done. Now we can focus on the next thing. I love so much the process of making games. So I'm [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=560.08s)]
*  already on the next one in my head. So for me, it's like, I mean, everything else that happens now [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=566.6400000000001s)]
*  is a bonus. And a lot of people sort of go on social media about your games. Do you take into [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=570.96s)]
*  account what people are saying online or making funny TikToks or anything like that? I mean, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=577.5200000000001s)]
*  sometimes I say I don't do Internet. You know, I mean, I look a little bit, but not a lot. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=583.76s)]
*  But I guess I mean, you're talking about something negative. The only thing I've [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  heard is positive stuff. Or is it something specific? No, it wasn't anything negative. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=592.4s)]
*  It's just funny. Funny memes come out of it and stuff. That's awesome. I mean, I mean, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=597.36s)]
*  the more people are engaging, the better. I mean, you know, the worst case scenario, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=602.56s)]
*  and I can't I mean, that must be horrifying when a developer does a game and nobody cares, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=606.4s)]
*  which is sadly quite common. I mean, imagine working on something for three, four years, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=610.8s)]
*  and it comes out and nobody is playing it or is caring about it or is talking about it. That's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=614.64s)]
*  quite devastating. I mean, I know some of colleagues have had that and it's not fun at all, actually. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  So I mean, compare that. It's amazing that we're getting this kind of reception. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=623.92s)]
*  You know, the redundancies that are happening, you know, in your sector, you know, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=629.12s)]
*  there's it's in the news almost every week now. Yeah, yeah. No, it's very sad. It's very sad, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=632.88s)]
*  obviously. And but I just hope that these things are happening like and something good will come [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=638.16s)]
*  out of it. You know, hopefully it's going to balance itself out. Like you say, in the COVID, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=644.4s)]
*  maybe people like, you know, put in more money than it might, you know, what it meant that was [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=648.16s)]
*  possible to get it back. And I think the effect is happening now. Hopefully it's going to balance [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  out and everything is going to be in a good place. I mean, I hope so. But who knows what's happened. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  But the key thing is that we get great games, I would say. But I mean, yeah, we hear a lot of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=666.16s)]
*  but I'm still optimistic. I still think that it will balance out and become better soon. I hope. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it must be quite hard, like when there's constant news lines coming out week in [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=677.28s)]
*  week out. I'm optimistic because we are seeing like examples of split that, you know, when you [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=681.68s)]
*  put out games that resonate, people buy them and people are happy. And then and here's the thing, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  I think there needs to be, like I said, the collaboration between the public because I [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=693.44s)]
*  think a lot of people that are putting down are the publishers being afraid there's too much money [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=696.88s)]
*  involved. Publishers need to step up and really trust, you know, the developer, but also developers, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=700.64s)]
*  I think, need to have sometimes a clear vision and stick with what they believe in. So when you [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=706.48s)]
*  combine those two, I think we can get it, get out, get great products, because people still want to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=710.72s)]
*  play great games out there. And when you say trust, what do you mean in that sense? Where does it [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=716.88s)]
*  break down? Yeah, so it's like if a developer has a vision of a game they truly believe in, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=722.0s)]
*  a publisher shouldn't have an account like, okay, what will they sell? How much money will we make? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=728.16s)]
*  What does this mean? You know, will we take our money back? You know, instead of like, okay, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=734.56s)]
*  what is actually like trusting if it's a unique like what we're doing, co-op only was the worst [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=739.28s)]
*  thing ever in the beginning, because all the marketing said that's not going to work. But [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=744.48s)]
*  EA still said, okay, you can go with it. So that's a good example of like, sure, it's a new thing, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=749.36s)]
*  let's go with it, let's see what it is, you know, but no, it wasn't the highest budget. So kind of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=753.36s)]
*  like a meeting in the middle. So maybe this publisher says, okay, we can do your thing, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=757.76s)]
*  but maybe lower the budget and the developer could be like, okay, we'll do that. So we meet in the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=762.16s)]
*  middle. So that's a good example of how it could. So was it hard to get commissioned at the start [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=766.48s)]
*  when people were telling you, no, that's not what we need at the moment? Well, I am a, what do you [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=770.96s)]
*  say a different breed? Like, I am always like, this will happen. You know, I have, I have, when I [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=778.08s)]
*  come into a room, I never pitch in my mind, I'm like, this is going to happen and it will happen. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  So but I don't expect everybody to be, you know, talking and behaving like me. But I'm just so sure [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  what I do, even when we did brothers, people came to me said, this will not work. They give me some, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=795.2s)]
*  you know, pre reviews that were super bad. But I'm like, they're wrong. They're wrong. Because I [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=800.32s)]
*  know it's great. I know it's great, you know, but that's me with my extreme confidence. What we do. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=804.72s)]
*  I love it. I wish I had your confidence, man. You have it. You have it. You don't know about it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=809.84s)]
*  You're an inspirational speaker as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's already there, my man. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  Just connect with it and it's there. Well, it takes two was about marriage counseling, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=822.64s)]
*  essentially the crux of it, which is hilarious. Have you ever heard of people falling out over [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  the game? Because you know, when you play in a heated situation, some people not making the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=833.76s)]
*  jumps and stuff like that. Have you heard anything bad from that? Yeah, for sure. When we did some [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=837.92s)]
*  testing quite late in it takes two, we saw some couples coming in and we could sense like, whoa, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=843.84s)]
*  these couples actually need to work on the communication because you could sense like, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=849.2s)]
*  oh, they're really getting upset because I mean, the game is designed for you to actually be able [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=853.12s)]
*  to communicate to finish it. So in a way it takes two is an split for that matter. It's a really [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=857.76s)]
*  good way to test your relationship. Like is your communication on par like for each other? So I [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=863.28s)]
*  think it's a good way to test your relationship for sure. But it's brilliant and have a good one. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TwX-hgJ6E&t=868.9599999999999s)]
