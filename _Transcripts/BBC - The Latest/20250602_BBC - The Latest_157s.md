Video Description: The UN has called for an independent investigation after the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said people being treated at a US-backed aid site in Gaza reported being shot at by the Israeli military. 
 
A "mass casualty influx" of people, many with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, was received at a Red Cross field hospital in southern Gaza, the organisation said, following disputed reports about an incident near an aid distribution centre in Rafah.
 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 21 people were "declared dead upon arrival" while women and children were among 179 cases.
The organisation's statement came after the Hamas-run civil defence agency in Gaza said at least 31 people were killed and many more wounded in the incident, which it blamed on "Israeli gunfire" targeting civilians.
 
But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said findings from an initial inquiry showed its forces had not fired at people while they were near or within the aid centre.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY)
*  Well, the UN has called for an independent investigation after Medicine Sans Frontier [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=0.0s)]
*  said that people it treated at a US-backed aid site in Gaza reported being shot at from [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=4.8s)]
*  all sides by the Israeli military. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Medical charities in Gaza say at least 21 people have been killed and more than 100 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=13.72s)]
*  injured following disputed reports about an incident near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=18.6s)]
*  compound in Ra'far. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=23.64s)]
*  The Israeli military says it did not fire at civilians while they were near or within [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=25.64s)]
*  the distribution site. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=29.8s)]
*  The BBC has asked the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation for an interview but it's declined our requests. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Israel doesn't allow the BBC and other international media to report on the ground in Gaza but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=37.8s)]
*  we do rely on trusted local freelancers sending footage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=43.68s)]
*  Well, our reporter Merlin Thomas has been following the story for BBC Verify. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  There are lots of claims and counterclaims swirling around this one particular incident [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  in southern Gaza and we've been looking into footage, into audio, into witness testimony [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=58.92s)]
*  as well to see what we can piece together. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=64.6s)]
*  Now I can talk you through one particular series of videos that the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=67.28s)]
*  Foundation has shared with us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=71.08s)]
*  Now this is CCTV footage from one of their aid distribution sites near Ra'far in southern [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Gaza and we verified where this is, this is in their distribution site and what we can [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=78.84s)]
*  see is we can see people running away from what appears to be, we don't know what we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=83.76s)]
*  can hear because we can't actually hear any audio on this but at one particular point [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  you can see what is tracify, so that is gunfire, those are rounds of gunfire and which are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  particularly illuminated as we see them as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  And elsewhere we've also seen videos from the Netzerim corridor as well which also appear [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=104.56s)]
*  to show people running away and cowering and we can hear gun firing those as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=110.28s)]
*  Now what's made our reporting particularly difficult is there are two separate incidents [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=115.04s)]
*  it appears, different reports, one is near Ra'far, one is near the Netzerim corridor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=120.12s)]
*  that's in northern Gaza and so these are two separate incidents and so this muddies the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=125.76s)]
*  waters when we are trying to understand and verify these facts. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=131.22s)]
*  We know where the distribution site is and we can verify that CCTV footage but it's worth [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  caveatting that it comes from one particular source that is the Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=140.64s)]
*  and we've tried to ask them more questions about this particular footage but they haven't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=145.48s)]
*  given us those answers so in the meantime we're looking into more footage and trying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=149.66s)]
*  to get to the bottom of this very unclear picture. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9_eGjjLcY&t=153.68s)]
