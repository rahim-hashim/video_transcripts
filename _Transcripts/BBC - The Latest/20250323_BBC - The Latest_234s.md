Video Description: Pope Francis has appeared at the window of the hospital in Rome for the first time since being admitted on 14 February.

The 88-year-old will be discharged on Sunday and will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican, doctors treating him have said.

During the past five weeks, he presented "two very critical episodes" where his "life was in danger", Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said.

"Today we are happy to say that tomorrow he will be at home," he told reporters on Saturday.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4)
*  Hello, I'm Nicky Schiller. Welcome to the programme. We're going to start in Rome because Pope Francis is expected to leave hospital shortly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=0.0s)]
*  And I want to take you to the live pictures from the hospital where he is being treated. We can show you the window. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, we are expecting the Pope to appear at the window very shortly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=16.0s)]
*  He, of course, has had five weeks of treatment for a severe infection that led to pneumonia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=21.0s)]
*  His doctors during that time say he suffered two life threatening episodes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=29.0s)]
*  Now, the 88 year old Pope was admitted to hospital on February the 14th. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=34.0s)]
*  Now, we are expecting him at the window where there is a papal suite in the hospital. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=40.0s)]
*  He's going to offer a blessing and probably wave to the people who've gathered there outside the hospital. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=45.0s)]
*  It will, of course, be the first time that he has appeared in public since he went into hospital. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=52.0s)]
*  His doctors now say that his pneumonia is gone and that he is stable, though he is not fully healed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=59.0s)]
*  That means that Francis is likely to need at least two months to recuperate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=67.0s)]
*  But he is, as we said, expected to appear at that window very shortly. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=73.0s)]
*  We can now see him coming out, being wheeled out on his chair. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=78.0s)]
*  Let's have a listen in to the crowd there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=83.0s)]
*  So, a microphone being brought out, let's have a listen to see if we can hear any words that the Pope is going to say. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=108.0s)]
*  So there we can see the Pope making a brief word that sounds not great. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=138.0s)]
*  We will, I assume, get a translation very shortly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=152.0s)]
*  But he was there waving with both hands the crowd that has gathered outside the Jamele hospital clapping and cheering. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=155.0s)]
*  This is the first appearance that we've had of the Pope since he was taken into hospital on February 14. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=163.0s)]
*  You can see there that he does look like he's struggling a little bit to breathe, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=171.0s)]
*  but he's waving a short appearance there at the balcony now being wheeled back into the hospital. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=176.0s)]
*  I'll take you to some pictures that are outside the hospital there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=184.0s)]
*  You can see that people have gathered, some hugs going on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=191.0s)]
*  Also, I know that this was being relayed to the people that had gathered at the Vatican. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=195.0s)]
*  There was a big screen that was set up outside the Vatican. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=201.0s)]
*  We can show you the pictures there where people have gathered to watch this, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=205.0s)]
*  the first appearance of the Pope since he was admitted to hospital. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=211.0s)]
*  As I said, we are now expecting him to be discharged from hospital and taken back to the Vatican where these pictures are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=217.0s)]
*  But his doctor's saying that he is going to have to have a period of rest, about two months of rest, they say. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WfJdyjheF4&t=225.0s)]
