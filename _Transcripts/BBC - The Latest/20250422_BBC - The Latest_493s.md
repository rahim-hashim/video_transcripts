Video Description: US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss and called him "a major loser".
 
In a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates "pre-emptively" to help boost the economy, and said Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments.
 
Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy came as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.

# US stocks and dollar plunge as Donald Trump attacks Fed chair Jerome Powell | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y)
*  The market in the United States have taken another hit. Investors saw another steep slide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=0.0s)]
*  on Wall Street. US stocks and the dollar plunged again on Monday as President Trump intensified [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=5.28s)]
*  his attacks on America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell. In a post on social media, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=10.76s)]
*  he called him, quote, a major loser for not lowering interest rates and called on Mr. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=16.46s)]
*  Powell to make preemptive cuts to help boost the economy. He said that the Fed had been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. Well, the president's comments [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=26.52s)]
*  sent Wall Street sharply lower, with all three major indices down over 2%. Gold, which is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=31.88s)]
*  the traditional safe haven in a time of uncertainty, has hit another record high. It's above $3,500. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=37.8s)]
*  We're also seeing some movement on global currency markets too. The British pound and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=45.68s)]
*  the Japanese yen jumping to their highest level against the US dollar since September [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=49.64s)]
*  last year. Let's make some sense of all this with Jeremy Stretch, Chief International Strategist [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=54.92s)]
*  at CIBC Capital Markets. Jeremy, good to have you here. Do exactly that if you will. What [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=59.24s)]
*  is going on here? Because markets unsure of a direction over recent weeks and then once [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=64.28s)]
*  again for other attacks on the head of America's independent central bank doesn't paint a picture [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=69.34s)]
*  of an economy that's pretty rosy right now. Oh, no, that's right. And you hit the nail [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=74.92s)]
*  on the head there when you're talking about independence, because of course that's been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  one of the central benchmarks, which is really underlined why international investors over [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=83.46s)]
*  decades have invested very heavily in terms of US assets and particularly US treasuries [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=88.13999999999999s)]
*  because of the independence of the central bank as the base baseline for monetary policy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=93.41999999999999s)]
*  And that issue or that bastion of independence is now being threatened by Mr. Trump. And [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=99.3s)]
*  of course, as you've mentioned, the IMF will be downgrading their global growth prospects [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=103.94s)]
*  this afternoon because of the influence on the impact of the tariff regime. So there [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=108.22s)]
*  is a real question mark regarding international investment flows going into the dollar. And [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=112.78s)]
*  in a sense, what we're seeing is international investors are deciding to keep more capital [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=117.26s)]
*  in terms of their own domestic markets. That includes the eurozone, it includes Japan, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=121.3s)]
*  and to an extent also includes the UK. So that is seeing investors moving away from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=124.94s)]
*  the US dollar and into alternative currencies and then also seeing that sort of safe haven [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=129.74s)]
*  bid to add it to the dollar as well. Yes. And as we said, the pound and the yen jumping [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=134.82s)]
*  to their highest level against the dollar since I think September. Is that about US [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=139.3s)]
*  dollar weakness or the strength of the pound and the yen? I think it's definitely a story [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=143.34s)]
*  of US dollar weakness. So we've seen international investors very much averse to holding dollars [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=148.22s)]
*  amidst this uncertainty which has really writ large emanating from the US. I think in terms [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  of Japan, it's very much the case that Japanese investors are keeping more money on shore. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  sort of issue regarding concerns in terms of investing in US assets. I think in terms [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=165.1s)]
*  of the UK, I think it's interesting that obviously we have seen a slight uptick in terms of some [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  of the economic mood music over the course of the last few weeks, despite the broader [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=174.94s)]
*  uncertainties. Now, it may well be the case that obviously the UK will see a downgrade [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=179.54s)]
*  to its growth prospects from the IMF later, but on a relative basis, the UK is holding [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=183.7s)]
*  in on a broader basis compared to the US. And I think that is providing some scope for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=188.1s)]
*  some resilience in terms of sterling and again, seeing less of those outflows which [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=193.86s)]
*  have really been influenced over the course of the last few few years. Jeremy, always [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=198.5s)]
*  good to talk to you. Thanks for your insight on that. Jeremy, straight to International [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=203.3s)]
*  Strategist at CIBC. Thank you. Well, that impact that tariffs is having on stock markets [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  is raising fears of economic recession. And of course, that is top of the agenda at this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  year's World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings. They're both taking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=216.66000000000003s)]
*  place in Washington, DC. North America business correspondent is Michelle Fleury and she's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=221.1s)]
*  there to talk us through what we might expect. President Donald Trump, as is the norm, won't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  be attending the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, but his presence [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  will loom large over the proceedings. At the start of this year, the US economy, while [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=237.38s)]
*  it was looking pretty good, plenty of economists were feeling upbeat. Many of them were forecasting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=243.22s)]
*  growth of around two and a half percent. But that optimism, it's starting to cool off. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=249.22s)]
*  The International Monetary Fund is expected to dial down its global growth forecast in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=255.46s)]
*  large part because of Trump's trade war, which is being felt well beyond US borders. Inflation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=260.22s)]
*  in the United States, which had been making progress, has started to stall out and those [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=266.5s)]
*  tariffs, well, they're not helping. The men and women who run the global economy and who [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=270.9s)]
*  were gathering this week for meetings in Washington are likely to try to ramp up negotiations [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=276.78s)]
*  with the Trump administration in an attempt to try to evade duties. Adding to all of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=281.58s)]
*  drama, the United States is considering whether or not to withdraw from both institutions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  If that were to happen, it could shake things up in a big way. Michelle Fleury for us there [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=293.38s)]
*  in Washington, DC. Michelle will have the very latest as those meetings get underway [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  a little later. Let's talk though now to Ariane Curtis, who's Senior Global Economist [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=304.3s)]
*  at Capital Economics. Ariane, good to have you here. Talk to me about what we might expect [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=308.54s)]
*  because all the mood music suggests they're going to downgrade growth, they're going to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=313.22s)]
*  warn on the impacts of those tariffs, rising inflation. None of it looks good. Is there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=316.1s)]
*  any area where there might be optimism? Yeah. So as you said, the main focus is really going [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  to be on the impact of tariffs and really this trade uncertainty, how that can weigh [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=325.14s)]
*  on the global outlook. It's the first set of IMF and World Bank meetings since tariffs [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  were started to be announced earlier this year. And it's not really a secret that there [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  are downgrades ahead. So the IMF have already warned of kind of these notable markdowns [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  in GDP forecasts for many countries. So it's likely that the 3.3% growth forecast they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=349.85999999999996s)]
*  put out in January for this year will be revised significantly. And they're probably, while [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  a global recession won't be their base case, they're likely to flag that there will be [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=365.06s)]
*  greater risk of this, especially if countries retaliate significantly to US tariffs. So [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=370.62s)]
*  we might see a situation where they kind of present this as a worst case scenario. If [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=377.18s)]
*  there was an all out trade war, this would knock X% off global GDP. How much influence [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=382.06s)]
*  do these reports have and how much should we care about the view of something like the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=387.5s)]
*  World Bank or the IMF? Because at best these are educated guesses about what might happen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=391.22s)]
*  We just don't know yet what impact these tariffs will have, do we? Yes. It's actually something [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=396.74s)]
*  that's really difficult for all forecasters, economic forecasters at this point. Almost [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=402.06s)]
*  is the point of having forecasts when there's so much uncertainty. So it's probably more [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=407.42s)]
*  likely that they'll talk a lot in terms of scenarios and really kind of an impact of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=413.18s)]
*  if tariffs were foreign to this way, X%, then this could be the impact on growth and inflation [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=419.22s)]
*  in these countries. But really it's going to be providing a range of estimates based [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=424.9s)]
*  on what just could happen to trade policies. Yeah. And one of the things that's hard to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=429.38s)]
*  quantify as well is sort of the indirect consequences of this and whether some countries [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=434.26s)]
*  around the world will think, well, blow the tariffs, we'll just deal with different countries [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=438.3s)]
*  instead and sort of cut America out of the picture. And that's quite hard to quantify [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=441.78s)]
*  at this stage. Yes, exactly. Of course, there's direct impacts from higher tariffs, but really [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=445.62s)]
*  it's this kind of indirect impact through this higher uncertainty that's going to be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=452.34s)]
*  a big factor. For example, we've already seen business surveys and consumer confidence [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=457.62s)]
*  surveys really deteriorate so far this year, especially in the US. We've seen financial [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=465.22s)]
*  market conditions tighten a lot. And there could be quite a big hit to business investment, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=470.38s)]
*  for example, if firms decide to put plans on hold until tariff policies become more [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=475.86s)]
*  clear, if they ever do become more clear. So you could think especially in some countries [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  like Canada and Mexico, which are very integrated with the US, that that would weigh there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=488.14000000000004s)]
