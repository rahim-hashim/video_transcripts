Video Description: In Hong Kong’s new “patriots-only” era, anonymous informing is now the norm.

BBC Eye investigates how the rise of “patriots-only” rule in Hong Kong has been marked by arrests of opposition figures, the silencing of critical media, and a growing culture of surveillance and anonymous reporting. Beneath the surface, critics warn the city is drifting toward a climate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.

Hongkongers who identify as patriots, including Innes Tang, who talks about how he reported around 100 people to the authorities for suspected national security violations.

Bookstore owner Pong Yat-ming describes how anonymous complaints have triggered repeated government inspections.

Veteran journalist Ronson Chan, arrested while reporting tells how he is now facing trial, and we visit a school promoting “national identity” classes under the new education agenda.

*  We don't need to do anything. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=2.0s)]
*  Because we are closed doors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=4.0s)]

*  But is that promise being kept? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=19.0s)]
*  Before we control the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=23.0s)]
*  we will always control the hands of those who love the country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=27.0s)]
*  This is a guarantee of Hong Kong's long-term security. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=31.0s)]

*  In 2020, after a year of demonstrations, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=135.0s)]

*  Hong Kong went from being one of the most liberal cities in Asia [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=168.0s)]

*  Businessman Innis Tang has long campaigned [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=231.0s)]
*  for closer links with mainland China. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=234.0s)]
*  After the law came into force, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=244.0s)]
*  Tang and his team posted videos [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=246.0s)]
*  each time they reported people to the police. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=249.0s)]
