Video Description: Five years on since George Floyd died during a police arrest in Minneapolis, his brother Philonise says his brother would be telling him to "keep fighting" for change in racial injustices in the US.
 
It comes as the Trump administration has rolled back a number of changes prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement following George Floyd's death, including police reform and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) plan.
 
This has since led to advocates for the reforms taking cases to the court to try and halt the president's plans to scale them back.

*  Video of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for around nine minutes as he struggled to breathe, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=9.28s)]
*  sparked global protests and a national conversation about racial injustice. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=16.8s)]
*  Five years on, the Trump administration is rolling back many of the policies prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=22.0s)]
*  like police reform and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=28.4s)]
*  In an interview marking the anniversary of his brother's death, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=33.12s)]
*  George Floyd's younger brother said he'd committed to keeping his brother's legacy alive through activism. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=36.0s)]
*  I think he would have just told me, keep fighting. He always told me you have to have heart. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=42.32s)]
*  As long as people know that you're there, they're willing to ride with you until all the wheels fall off. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=48.0s)]
*  They're still going to be there with you. And a lot of these people never gave up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=56.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Jake Kwan has more. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, many of our viewers will remember that awful video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=64.48s)]
*  George Floyd, killing him. And that video has sent millions of people to the street chanting Black [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=70.48s)]
*  Lives Matter and chanting for the police accountability and racial justice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=75.36s)]
*  And since then, many governments and companies have promised to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=80.0s)]
*  address this bias and discrimination. But five years on, these policies are at risk. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Trump has come back to the office promising to roll back these policies, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=91.2s)]
*  which he sees as a reverse discrimination which undermines merit-based society. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=96.48s)]
*  His Justice Department said that they will stop the police reform agreement, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=101.84s)]
*  which his predecessor had been negotiating with the city of Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=106.88s)]
*  even though inquiries have found that police departments in these cities [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  have problems of racial discrimination. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=116.0s)]
*  Now, Mr. Trump is also purging his government of any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=118.8s)]
*  saying that these must be purged out of also universities and sports, as well as law firms [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=125.6s)]
*  across the country. Now, advocates of these programs have taken to courts to try to defy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=133.04s)]
*  Mr. Trump, but Mr. Trump's efforts show no sign of slowing down. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Thanks to Jake for that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKcxJqVwIOg&t=145.6s)]
