# Russian President Vladimir Putin announces temporary ceasefire in Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo)
*  Now, Ukraine's foreign minister says if Russia wants peace, it must hold a ceasefire immediately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=0.0s)]
*  It says Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a surprise three-day ceasefire in Ukraine [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=6.86s)]
*  from the 8th of May. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  The Kremlin says this coincides with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=13.52s)]
*  The announcement comes after Donald Trump questioned the Russian leader's willingness [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=19.3s)]
*  to halt the three-year offensive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=22.96s)]
*  The Kremlin says it's ready to hold peace talks without preconditions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=25.38s)]
*  But it hasn't agreed to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, which was originally proposed by [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=29.06s)]
*  Washington and which Ukraine backs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=34.86s)]
*  Earlier, Mr Putin thanked the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, for providing troops [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=37.78s)]
*  to help Russia fight Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  And our correspondent, John Donnison, is in Kyiv for us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=45.54s)]
*  John, hello to you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  What's the reaction there? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=50.86s)]
*  Well, it's one of skepticism. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=55.26s)]
*  I mean, I think what you've got here is President Putin trying to signal to President Trump [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=57.06s)]
*  and the Americans that it's not the Russians who are blocking peace. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=62.14s)]
*  So what he is proposing is a three-day ceasefire starting on the 8th of May or until the 11th, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=66.34s)]
*  and he's doing that for what he calls humanitarian reasons. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=73.02s)]
*  But certainly here in Ukraine, a lot of skepticism, the foreign minister calling it a parade and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=76.34s)]
*  questioning why we can't just have a ceasefire immediately and why the Russians have been [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=82.58s)]
*  rejecting this request from the Americans to have a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=89.06s)]
*  The Russians have been rejecting that for weeks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  So I guess any news of a ceasefire, potential ceasefire, is good news. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=97.38s)]
*  But let's wait to see if it happens and let's wait to see if it holds. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=103.9s)]
*  So, of course, the last Russian ceasefire, which was for 30 hours over the Easter holiday weekend, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=107.48s)]
*  well, that was really a ceasefire in all but name. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=114.28s)]
*  And we had numerous breaches from both sides and no real ceasefire to note, really. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And a big difference, John, between three days and 30 days, which you were alluding [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=126.0s)]
*  to, of course, that proposal originally came from the US. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=130.52s)]
*  And I wonder if Ukraine is hoping that the US might be minded to pivot back towards thinking [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=133.12s)]
*  about a 30-day ceasefire more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=138.96s)]
*  Well, that is certainly what Ukraine wants. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=141.24s)]
*  President Zelenskyy again said over the weekend that what Ukraine wants is a 30-day unconditional [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=147.44s)]
*  ceasefire from land, air and sea. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=155.6s)]
*  And only then, only when that is established, will they be prepared to enter into more comprehensive [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=158.72s)]
*  talks about territory, about Ukraine's future security. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=165.12s)]
*  Now, it's interesting because we've been reacting over the weekend every time President Trump [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=169.4s)]
*  speaks, but he seems to say something a little bit different every day. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=175.12s)]
*  So at one moment, he's criticizing President Zelenskyy and calling him inflammatory and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=178.28s)]
*  saying he's harder to deal with than President Putin. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  And then the next day, of course, or a few days later, we had that meeting in the Vatican [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  with President Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump, tete-a-tete in the Vatican and chewing over things. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=190.92s)]
*  And we heard much more positive comments from Mr. Trump and basically saying it was Mr. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=199.48s)]
*  Putin who was tapping him along or stringing him along, as Mr. Trump put it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=205.76s)]
*  So I think we just have to wait and see until we get something concrete in place. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=211.96s)]
*  And we can't really just keep reacting to every single thing Donald Trump says. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=218.24s)]
*  OK, John, thank you very much. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=223.08s)]
*  John Donason there in the Ukrainian capital. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=225.08s)]
*  And we can speak now to former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Bill, thank you very much indeed for your time joining us today on BBC News. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=232.28s)]
*  So is this announcement from Russia, in your opinion, linked to that criticism that John [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=236.56s)]
*  was just talking about, that criticism that Donald Trump made about Vladimir Putin, wondering [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=241.64s)]
*  if he was just stringing him along? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=250.2s)]
*  I think you're right, Nita. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=251.2s)]
*  I think John's right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=252.2s)]
*  That is, President Putin has recognized, has observed that President Trump is running out [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  of patience with President Putin. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=259.8s)]
*  This has been a trend, as you've just reported over the last week or so, where it's very [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=262.46s)]
*  clear who's holding up the discussions of a ceasefire and a broader settlement. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=268.24s)]
*  And it's Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=274.08s)]
*  And John just indicated that President Trump and President Zelensky agreed on a 30-day [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=276.08s)]
*  comprehensive ceasefire, air, land and sea, just as John said. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=281.0s)]
*  And President Putin turned it down. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=285.0s)]
*  Now President Putin comes back and says, well, let's have a three-day ceasefire, like the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  one that wasn't observed over Easter. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=291.04s)]
*  So the Ukrainians can be forgiven to be a little skeptical of this proposal from President [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=295.08s)]
*  Putin. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=299.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=300.96s)]
*  And until the last few days, really, the language from the U.S. administration has resolutely, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=301.96s)]
*  I think, been more favorable towards Vladimir Putin and towards Russia. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=307.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people would agree. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=312.56s)]
*  So do you think that Donald Trump and his team are in all seriousness now reviewing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=314.96s)]
*  and potentially revising their thinking on this? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=322.0s)]
*  I do think so, Nita. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=325.76s)]
*  I think so. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=326.92s)]
*  And I think that that tete-a-tete in the Vatican between President Trump and President Zelensky [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=327.92s)]
*  had some real effect. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=333.48s)]
*  I've also heard that the proposal, the ceasefire proposal that the Americans had put forward [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=335.56s)]
*  to the Ukrainians and to the Russians, which, as you say, was generally received as pretty [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=342.12s)]
*  pretty favorable to the Russians, that that proposal may be undergoing some changes, that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=348.44s)]
*  that proposal may now reflect some of the discussions that the Americans have had with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=353.88s)]
*  the Ukrainians and the discussions the Americans have had with the Europeans in London last [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=359.44s)]
*  week. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=364.72s)]
*  So there is, I think you're exactly right to say there is a shift in focus for the Americans [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=365.72s)]
*  to be supportive of the Ukrainians and to be skeptical and indeed even impatient with [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  the Russians. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=379.04s)]
*  And where does all of this leave Mr. Trump's timeframe for America's involvement in this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=380.04s)]
*  process and their willingness to continue or not? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  Well they've said a couple of times, and Secretary Rubio has made this point as well, that it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=390.76s)]
*  can't take forever. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=395.0s)]
*  But they've now talked about weeks, not days. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=396.56s)]
*  And weeks is what, weeks, it's going to take weeks in order to come to some kind of an [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=400.48s)]
*  agreement on a ceasefire. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=405.04s)]
*  The outline of that ceasefire, as I say, is emerging, is evolving, but to incorporate [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  the European and Ukrainian suggestions and then go back to the Russians to get their [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=414.12s)]
*  agreement, may take some pressure to get their agreement, it's going to take more than days. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=419.88s)]
*  It's going to take several weeks. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=425.16s)]
*  And my understanding is that the US administration is willing to do that for the next couple [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  of weeks, not for the next couple of months. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, really good to hear your thoughts on all of that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=435.0s)]
*  Bill Taylor, former US ambassador to Ukraine, thank you very much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=437.84s)]
*  Thank you, Anita. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDUJy9iAFfo&t=442.4s)]
