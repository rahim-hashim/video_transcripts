# US economy shrinks as companies race to get ahead of Trump tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA)
*  Welcome to Business Today live from New York. I'm Michelle Flurry and the Dow is down sharply at the open, nearly 1% at the opening bell after new figures show the economy unexpectedly shrank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=0.0s)]
*  Gross domestic product decreased at a 0.3% annualised rate in the last quarter, according to the US Department of Commerce. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=12.0s)]
*  That's the first contraction since 2022 and it marks a sharp downturn after growth at an annual pace of 2.4% in the previous quarter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=20.0s)]
*  The decline was driven by a drop in government spending and a more than 40% surge in imports, which count against growth as companies race to get ahead of tariffs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=29.0s)]
*  I'm joined by Victoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at CrossMart Global Investments. Good to see you. Are you surprised by how markets are reacting to this data? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=40.0s)]
*  I'm a little bit surprised because we knew there was a good chance that we would see a negative GDP number come out this morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=51.0s)]
*  You look at some of the expectations that have been printed and it was anywhere from a negative 2.5%, negative 3%, all the way up to a positive 1%. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=59.0s)]
*  There was a wide range there and knowing that we had that huge gain in imports, which you just mentioned, people should have anticipated we might have a negative number. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=70.0s)]
*  Yes, the market is down here to start, but as you know, these markets have been quite volatile, so we'll see where we end up at the end of the day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=81.0s)]
*  Obviously, we're focusing right now on GDP data, but after the market closed, we're going to hear from two of the biggest names in technology reporting earnings. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=90.0s)]
*  Which do you think will ultimately be the bigger driver for investors? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=98.0s)]
*  There's a lot of data coming out this week. Like you said, we've got Meta and Microsoft today. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=103.0s)]
*  We've got more big tech names tomorrow and then we have the big jobs report on Friday, along with some inflation numbers in there too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=109.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be a combination of everything, probably culminating with the jobs report on Friday that really drives the market. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=116.0s)]
*  But for these tech names, we know they've lost leadership. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=123.0s)]
*  People are going to be looking to see, are they going to be able to gain that leadership back and drive the market higher? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=127.0s)]
*  They'll be looking at HAPEX spending, what is the return on their AI investment? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=133.0s)]
*  Ads will be very important for Meta. We saw Snap had very poor ad numbers, so we'll see how that works for Meta. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=139.0s)]
*  There'll be a lot of information to digest. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=146.0s)]
*  And obviously we are in the middle of earnings season, as you say, you kind of mentioned a couple there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=150.0s)]
*  How important is guidance? Because a lot of companies right now are saying the tariff situation is too confusing, too uncertain. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=155.0s)]
*  And so they're dropping that. And that leaves investors a bit more in the dark, doesn't it? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=163.0s)]
*  It does, absolutely. And the companies that are pulling that guidance, you see the response in their stock price. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=167.0s)]
*  They've had quite a negative reaction on the stock price when they do that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=173.0s)]
*  But look, we look at earnings numbers and we know that they're backward looking. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=177.0s)]
*  And everyone's concern is that we really had tariffs come into play starting in the second quarter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=182.0s)]
*  So it's all about what that's going to look like in the second, third, fourth quarter of this year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=188.0s)]
*  So guidance really is key. That is what's telling people what's going to happen going forward. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=193.0s)]
*  And when you're not giving any guidance because you're concerned about the macroeconomic situation, that makes investors very nervous. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=198.0s)]
*  Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments. Always good to see you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=206.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=211.0s)]
*  And just an update. The S&P 500 now down one and a half percent. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=213.0s)]
*  Again, that GDP headline about a contraction in the economy really driving things. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=217.0s)]
*  It's also causing a stir in Washington. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=222.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has said on Truth Social that it was a Biden overhang. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=225.0s)]
*  He says that it is not his economy that this number, as Victoria was just saying, is backward looking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=231.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got Democratic Congressman Richie Torres saying it's official. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=236.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has finally liberated the American economy from growth. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=241.0s)]
*  He says, making recessions great again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=245.0s)]
*  Well, for more on the GDP numbers, which clearly are already dividing politicians, I'm joined by Ken Kim, senior economist at KPMG. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=248.0s)]
*  Great to see you, Ken. If you could talk us through. You have this headline number that the economy shrank. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=258.0s)]
*  That's not the whole story, though. Can you explain why this data is messy? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=263.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=268.0s)]
*  What's really interesting about the GDP report is that even though it is backward looking, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=270.0s)]
*  you had preemptive behavior by both consumers and businesses acting before the tariffs were actually were announced in early April. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=276.0s)]
*  So, for example, the huge increase in imports that you mentioned, with the exception of COVID, the surge in imports was the highest since the early 1970s. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=288.0s)]
*  So you're talking about more than 50 years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=299.0s)]
*  And the reason for that was businesses wanted to bring the goods in ahead of time before the tariffs hit prices. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=302.0s)]
*  And in terms of consumer spending, personal consumption expenditures in the GDP report was up 1.8 percent on an annualized basis, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=312.0s)]
*  which is fairly good considering all the uncertainty in the economy and financial markets these days. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=324.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons you had the good spending is that consumers brought forward their spending. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=332.0s)]
*  Where does that report then leave the Federal Reserve, America's central bank? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=338.0s)]
*  Well, inflation is still running high in the United States, somewhere between two and a half to 2.8 percent annually. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=343.0s)]
*  It still puts the Fed on the sidelines. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=352.0s)]
*  We don't expect the Fed to start cutting rates until the fourth quarter of this year. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=355.0s)]
*  And with the expectation that we will be hit by price shocks because of the tariffs, inflation is likely to go higher over the coming months. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=361.0s)]
*  Briefly, you mentioned that consumers pulled forward or businesses pulled forward inventory orders in anticipation of tariffs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=373.0s)]
*  Do you think this data shows how the economy actually responded to April's tariff announcement? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=384.0s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=389.0s)]
*  So there is a clear kind of cutoff or demarcation with April 2nd. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=392.0s)]
*  So going forward, we think the inflationary shock that will hit both consumers and businesses will dampen consumer spending as well as curtail capital spending by businesses over the coming quarters of 2025 and weaken growth for the remainder of this year. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=398.0s)]
*  Ken Kim, Senior Economist at KPMG, thank you for talking us through that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw8K3B73GBA&t=422.0s)]
