Video Description: Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to meet with President Trump since his inauguration. 

The visit comes despite the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu in November 2024 as well as Israel's former Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant. 

Hamas leaders have also faced war crimes allegations, including arrest warrants from the ICC.

Israel and Hamas have denied the allegations, and those against Israel are rejected by the US.

It’s been over a year since some of the allegations were made. This explainer recaps on who’s making the accusations, what evidence they have, and the latest on legal proceedings.

# What are the war crimes allegations against Israel and Hamas? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM)
*  Israel have faced several war crimes allegations since the start of the war in Gaza in October [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=0.0s)]

*  recap. Who's making the accusations? What's the evidence? And where do the legal proceedings [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  stand? The prosecutor at the ICC has issued arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=24.72s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of being responsible [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=34.48s)]
*  for several war crimes during Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The allegations include [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=40.2s)]
*  starvation, willful killing, intentionally directing attacks against civilians and extermination. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=45.32s)]
*  Here are some examples of claims by the ICC and other rights groups against Israel. Over [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=53.36s)]
*  47,200 Palestinians have been killed, many women and children. Doctors working in Gaza [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=58.84s)]
*  claim Israeli snipers and drones targeted children. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=66.36s)]
*  This was day after day after day, operating on children who would say I was lying on the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=69.84s)]
*  ground after a bomber dropped and this quadcopter came down and hovered over me and shot me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=75.92s)]
*  Hamas strongly denies targeting civilians. Hamas hides behind civilians and inevitably [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=82.88s)]
*  some of those civilians have regrettably and tragically been harmed. There are further [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=87.88s)]
*  allegations of Palestinian civilians, including children, being detained and mistreated. One [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  case alleges an adult detainee was subjected to sexual assault. Videos appear to show detainees [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=99.44s)]
*  being used as human shields to check unexplored tunnels and homes for traps. The US State [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Department is investigating prism and mistreatment, while the Israeli military have opened 74 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=111.56s)]
*  criminal investigations into conduct by soldiers. Most cases are ongoing, however some officers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=116.96s)]
*  have been found guilty. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=122.52s)]
*  In December 2023, South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=128.0s)]
*  of Justice, accusing them of committing genocide in Gaza. 14 countries have joined the case. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=132.56s)]
*  Their evidence includes the destruction of over 66% of Gaza's infrastructure, causing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=139.76s)]
*  the mass displacement of 90% of the population, 1.9 million people. Prosecutors at the ICJ [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=144.92s)]
*  claim this has inflicted conditions intended to cause the destruction of the Palestinian [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=152.16s)]
*  people. Further evidence shows Israeli leaders and officials allegedly inciting to commit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=156.28s)]
*  genocide. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  South Africa argued this statement shows specific intents to commit and persist in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  committing genocidal acts. The ICJ ordered provisional measures in January 2024, aimed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=177.28s)]
*  at preventing any acts that could be considered genocidal. The case is still ongoing, with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=184.0s)]
*  a final verdict undecided. Both the ICJ and ICC depend on member states to carry out arrest [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=189.2s)]
*  warrants and uphold their rulings. The US has rejected both cases. France, Italy and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=195.28s)]
*  Hungary have given immunity from the ICC's arrest warrants because Israel has not signed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=201.4s)]
*  the Rome Statute. However, Israel is a signatory to the UN Charter, so the ICJ's rulings are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=206.12s)]
*  theoretically binding. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=212.36s)]
*  If Israel or other member states do not comply with the ICJ's final verdict, it's perhaps [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=214.48s)]
*  unclear what will happen. The decision would be referred to the Security Council by the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=219.84s)]
*  state that wins the case, so to speak. But in this case, because where Israel has significant [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=226.32s)]
*  allies on the Security Council, now there's like to block any action. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  The prosecutor at the ICC has also accused the leaders of Hamas, prescribed as a terrorist [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=242.16s)]
*  group by Western countries, of war crimes and crimes against humanity from October 7th, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=246.84s)]
*  2023, including [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=252.28s)]
*  Hamas was also accused by many of committing genocidal acts on October 7th, but cannot [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=261.8s)]
*  be prosecuted at the ICJ because Gaza is not a state. Allegations that Hamas rejects, calling [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=266.92s)]
*  baseless. Evidence includes the killing of over 1,200 people. More than 800 were civilians, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=273.24s)]
*  including children, with some footage taken from the cameras of the attackers themselves. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=280.6s)]
*  One of the clearest war crimes committed by Hamas is the conduct that we saw on October 7th. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=285.36s)]
*  Images of victims' bodies indicate sexual violence, decapitations and burning. Around [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=293.0s)]
*  251 people were taken hostage, including children and elderly. Some have since been [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=298.84s)]
*  released. More than 100 hostages are presumed dead. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=304.44s)]
*  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Daif, who's believed to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=309.08s)]
*  have orchestrated the attacks, with Hamas commander Yahya Sidnwa, plus Ismail Haneeye. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  Since then, all three leaders have been killed. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  So the implications of it being confirmed that Mohammed Daif is deceased means that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=322.92s)]
*  it's highly likely that the International Criminal Court will close the case against [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  Mohammed Daif. And I think that will have a significant political implication because [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  the only arrest warrants in the Israel-Hamas conflict will be issued towards Israeli figures. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=338.36s)]
*  With no deadline for a final verdict to be reached by the ICC or ICJ, the court's authority [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=347.84s)]
*  and how justice is served if Israel or Hamas are found guilty remains unclear, as some [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  countries refuse to follow their orders. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBzo_ZJYM&t=358.32s)]
