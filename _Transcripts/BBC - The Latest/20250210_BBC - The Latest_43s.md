# Kendrick Lamar is the first solo rapper to headline the Super Bowl. #KendrickLamar #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME)
*  Kendrick Lamar headlined the Super Bowl on Sunday nights. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=0.0s)]
*  But fans weren't sure if he'd play his Grammy-winning diss track, Not Like Us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=2.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=5.72s)]
*  Because Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics in the track [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=6.28s)]
*  that branded him as a sexual predator, which Drake denies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=9.36s)]
*  But a couple of minutes into the Super Bowl halftime show, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar said, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=14.76s)]
*  I want to play their favourite song, but you know they love to sue. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=15.92s)]
*  After teasing the song over and over, he finally played it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=18.52s)]
*  He self-censored the most controversial lyric, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  where he calls Drake a certified paedophile, missing out the word paedophile. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=23.36s)]
*  In Drake's lawsuit, his lawyer said the allegations were false. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=27.16s)]
*  But Kendrick did include the notorious line from the track, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=30.0s)]
*  trying to strike a chord and it's probably a minor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=32.8s)]
*  Which the crowd echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=35.44s)]
*  and he called out Drake's name at one point. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  What did you think of the performance? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5j5hT1XME&t=40.84s)]
