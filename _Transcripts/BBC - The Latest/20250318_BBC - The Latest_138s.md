*  Let's return to that breaking news, that phone call has ended between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me take you through the lines that are emerging. They are coming from the Kremlin at the moment, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=5.2s)]
*  but I took you through some of them saying that Putin had reaffirmed his commitment to a peaceful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=10.4s)]
*  resolution of the conflict. That is very broad brush. We were waiting to hear more of the crucial [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=16.96s)]
*  detail. I'll come back to that in a moment, but also the Kremlin making the point. Ukrainian Russia [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=22.64s)]
*  would agree to swap 175 prisoners of war and Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agree to stay [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=27.28s)]
*  in contact. Now, in terms of the context of any potential ceasefire initiative, the Kremlin saying [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=33.04s)]
*  in that context, Vladimir Putin has said there must be a stop to Ukrainian mobilization and the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=41.36s)]
*  arming of Ukraine. And that is very, very clearly a condition, exactly the sort of thing that EU [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  officials are warning against. Alexander Stubbe, who is the president of Finland, he was on the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=56.16s)]
*  program a couple of hours ago. I asked him directly about that point because it had been floated, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=61.68s)]
*  that that may be one of the conditions that the Russian president would set and he has done [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=67.52s)]
*  exactly that according to the Kremlin. I'll repeat it because it is very important here. In terms of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=72.96s)]
*  the context of the ceasefire initiative, they say Moscow, that Vladimir Putin has said there must be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=78.96s)]
*  a stop to Ukrainian mobilization. So that's what Ukraine does and the arming of Ukraine, that of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=84.56s)]
*  course is what European countries and NATO have been doing. So two critical conditions there, both, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=91.84s)]
*  I would say, are unacceptable at first reading to the various Europeans, given what they've said [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=100.08s)]
*  over recent weeks. So those are some of the lines coming into us here from that meeting. One other [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=106.0s)]
*  line actually I forgot to mention with the Kremlin saying that Vladimir Putin has agreed to halt [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=112.0s)]
*  strikes on the energy infrastructure for 30 days, assuming of course there was some sort of ceasefire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=117.28s)]
*  So those are the key lines that are coming out. We'll return to those breaking developments here [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=124.24s)]
*  in a moment or two. So do stay with us with that and of course head to the BBC Live page [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=129.28s)]
*  and all those new lines are coming in all the time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44stP5-XRFU&t=134.56s)]
