# LIVE: Pope Francis' funeral | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA)
*  I've come down to what you can see behind me. This is the Pope Mobile. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=0.0s)]
*  There were actually three of them made for the Pope's visit here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5.0s)]
*  It was ten years ago, but it is still really vividly remembered, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=8.0s)]
*  particularly by all those who got close to Pope Francis during that visit. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12.0s)]
*  People are very devout here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16.0s)]
*  There's a particularly sort of intense and colourful form of Catholicism [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18.0s)]
*  that's followed in the Philippines. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=21.0s)]
*  Around 80% of the population say they belong to the Roman Catholic faith, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=23.0s)]
*  so the papal visit was a big event for them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=27.0s)]
*  This one was constructed in the style of what's known as a jeepney. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=29.0s)]
*  That's a local form of transport that's very characteristic in here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=33.0s)]
*  And the Pope sat in the back and toured around Manila when he was here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=37.0s)]
*  So this has been brought out here so people can come down. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=42.0s)]
*  There's a little shrine behind it where people have been lighting candles [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=45.0s)]
*  and a large sort of cutout of Pope Francis there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=49.0s)]
*  And we're seeing this right across the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=52.0s)]
*  Almost every church has either a chapel or a small space put aside [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=54.0s)]
*  with images of Pope Francis and places where people can light candles [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=58.0s)]
*  and say prayers and leave messages as well for him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=63.0s)]
*  There will be some masses today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=66.0s)]
*  These are masses that would have been held anyway. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=69.0s)]
*  They've been adapted to coincide with the funeral, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=71.0s)]
*  and they are being masses now explicitly, requiem masses, for the Pope. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=74.0s)]
*  And people are also thinking very hard about the impact that Pope Francis had. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=79.0s)]
*  And people really felt that he was something different, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=84.0s)]
*  that he brought the church back down to earth [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=87.0s)]
*  and was able to reach out to many people who kind of got rather distant to the church. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=90.0s)]
*  I mean, for all Filipinos who are very devout, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=96.0s)]
*  only just over a third of them say they go to mass every week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=98.0s)]
*  Numbers who go to church are dropping. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=101.0s)]
*  The church is very worried about this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=103.0s)]
*  And they do believe that Pope Francis' example [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=105.0s)]
*  and the kinds of humorous, informal messaging that he put out [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=109.0s)]
*  have helped bring some people back to the faith. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=113.0s)]
*  Jonathan, are people talking about the kind of Pope they want next, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=116.0s)]
*  who they want to take over from Pope Francis, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=122.0s)]
*  bearing in mind the legacy that you've just mentioned? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, of course, one of the frontrunners is indeed a Filipino cardinal, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=130.0s)]
*  Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=134.0s)]
*  And there's, I would say, quiet excitement at the possibility [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=136.0s)]
*  that there's a real chance we could see a Filipino Pope. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=139.0s)]
*  I think it depends where you fall on the various schools of thought [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=143.0s)]
*  about the Catholic Church. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=147.0s)]
*  There are conservatives here, too, who felt perhaps a little uncomfortable [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=149.0s)]
*  with some of the forthright messaging, rather blunt messaging, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=153.0s)]
*  of Pope Francis and his insistence on being very open to everybody. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=157.0s)]
*  But there are others here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=162.0s)]
*  And I think some of the most committed priests are very socially active. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=164.0s)]
*  You could say they were influenced to some degree by what we call liberation theology. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=168.0s)]
*  They felt in Pope Francis they had real support, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=172.0s)]
*  particularly during, there was a brutal drug war carried out here [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=175.0s)]
*  by the previous Duterte administration, thousands of people killed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=179.0s)]
*  And many of the priests who spoke out against that were threatened by the government, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=182.0s)]
*  had death threats as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=187.0s)]
*  They felt that Pope Francis was really behind them [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=189.0s)]
*  and that he laid the groundwork for the Church to get more up-to-date [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=192.0s)]
*  with changing social values. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=195.0s)]
*  The Church here, like everywhere, the Catholic Church has opposed family planning, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=197.0s)]
*  which the Philippines badly needs and is now legal and available here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=201.0s)]
*  They oppose divorce. This is a very contentious issue here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=205.0s)]
*  Some of those priests say we do at least need to have a conversation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=208.0s)]
*  about being more flexible on these doctrines, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=211.0s)]
*  and they really hope that the next Pope will be somebody in the same vein as Francis. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=213.0s)]
*  Although I think they acknowledge that among all the candidates and the cardinals, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=218.0s)]
*  there's perhaps no one who quite has that very quirky personality [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=222.0s)]
*  that Pope Francis had. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=225.0s)]
*  Jonathan, for the moment, thank you very much. Jonathan Head in Manila. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=227.0s)]
*  Let's go to Soweto now and speak to our South African correspondent, Pumza Filani, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=231.0s)]
*  and a huge number of people turning to Catholicism in Africa. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=237.0s)]
*  And this is really where the Catholic Church is going to be centered in the future in many respects, Pumza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=244.0s)]
*  It certainly looks like it. If we're looking at just the numbers alone, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=253.0s)]
*  currently just over 280 million people are spread across Africa, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=256.0s)]
*  and it's said to be one of the few places around the world where Catholicism is growing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=263.0s)]
*  We're seeing more and more young people, especially, joining the Church from different parts of the continent, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=268.0s)]
*  seeing the Church as a place where they can have their voice heard, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=273.0s)]
*  or at least a place where they can bring some of their problems [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=277.0s)]
*  and hope that those problems are communicated further up the chain through to the Vatican. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=279.0s)]
*  It certainly is why there seems to have been a real resonance in Africa from Pope Francis' message. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=284.0s)]
*  Certainly. He was seen by many Africans as somebody who was incredibly relatable, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=296.0s)]
*  somebody whose heart was close to the heart of the poor [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=301.0s)]
*  and understood some of the real struggles that many Africans face today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=305.0s)]
*  There are issues around immigration and a growing population of refugees [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=310.0s)]
*  and people that are displaced in various places around the world. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=314.0s)]
*  And he was seen to have a soft spot in advocating for those people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=318.0s)]
*  He was also seen as somebody who was not afraid to say the uncomfortable thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=323.0s)]
*  He even most recently spoke about the Church looking at embracing blessing same-sex marriages. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=327.0s)]
*  Of course, this caused controversy in some parts of the Church, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=333.0s)]
*  because not many African countries embrace this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=336.0s)]
*  In fact, it is illegal in a number of African countries. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=339.0s)]
*  But he was seen by people who are looking for the Church to be more open [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=346.0s)]
*  as somebody who was at least willing to have those difficult conversations [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=351.0s)]
*  and advocate for open conversations in the Church, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=355.0s)]
*  and somebody who was wanting society to be reflected in the Church, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=359.0s)]
*  that he understood that the world is changing and that perhaps with that change [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=363.0s)]
*  open and frank conversations should be happening about where the countries are individually going [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=368.0s)]
*  and where they all fit in in the global community. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=373.0s)]
*  So how are Roman Catholics across South Africa marking today? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=376.0s)]
*  Well, we've seen a number of services over the last few days, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=383.0s)]
*  with a few expected to continue. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=387.0s)]
*  Just outside here, Regina Mundi, which is the largest church here in South Africa, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=389.0s)]
*  they're planning on having a memorial service over the next few days [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=394.0s)]
*  where they're not only expecting to welcome Sowetans, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=397.0s)]
*  but people from around Southern Africa to come and pay their respects [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=400.0s)]
*  and use it also as a time to just celebrate the Pope's celebration, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=405.0s)]
*  the Pope's life rather, to the body of the Church, but also the greater African community. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=409.0s)]
*  Pumza, thank you very much. Pumza Falani in Soweto. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=415.0s)]
*  Let's speak to our Rome correspondent, Sarah Rainsford. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=419.0s)]
*  Sarah, we've seen the crowds already pouring in to St Peter's Square, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=422.0s)]
*  but this is an opportunity for ordinary members of the public to take part in something very special [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=428.0s)]
*  alongside all of those dignitaries that are flying in from around the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=435.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Lots and lots of world leaders, lots of members of royal families, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=440.0s)]
*  lots of dignitaries heading here and already here in town for this funeral event, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=446.0s)]
*  but also, as you say, Catholics from all over the world. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=452.0s)]
*  We just saw a big group of American Catholics who said they'd come here especially for the funeral, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=455.0s)]
*  a man from Capo Verde as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=460.0s)]
*  We have seen lots of young Catholics here, groups of young Italian Catholics [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=462.0s)]
*  and one group just from Milan who've come for the funeral. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=468.0s)]
*  Interesting, I suppose, because of course this is a church which has global reach, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=472.0s)]
*  1.4 billion Catholics right around the world, a church with a lot of influence around the world [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=476.0s)]
*  and so lots of people who wanted to be here at the Vatican to be part of this funeral mass. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=481.0s)]
*  It's still, what, two hours to go I think now until the mass itself begins, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=487.0s)]
*  but the crowd's been building all through the morning. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=491.0s)]
*  Some people actually spent the night in St Peter's Square [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=493.0s)]
*  camped out with sleeping bags and blankets on the cobblestones. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=496.0s)]
*  Then early this morning, very early this morning, we saw priests and nuns dashing through the streets [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=499.0s)]
*  trying to reach the square to get their place for this really big day for the church. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=505.0s)]
*  But they're coming because they want to remember Pope Francis. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=510.0s)]
*  You ask people here what it is they think about when they think about Francis, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=513.0s)]
*  what kind of pope he was for them, and people always talk about his kind face, his gentle manner, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=516.0s)]
*  his humane attitude, the fact that he cared about the poor, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=523.0s)]
*  the fact he wanted this to be a church which was poor and for the poor. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=529.0s)]
*  These are the kinds of things that people who speak to here talk about. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=532.0s)]
*  And that is represented I think in his funeral mass today. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=536.0s)]
*  The fact that there will be people here from those communities he cared about, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=539.0s)]
*  poorer people, migrants and refugees, people he has helped and that the Catholic Church has helped, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=543.0s)]
*  and also prisoners. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=548.0s)]
*  We understand that arrangements were being made for some prisoners to be able to attend [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=550.0s)]
*  because Pope Francis often used to visit prisons, even to wash the feet of prisoners [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=554.0s)]
*  in a sort of mark of humility and the way he led his papacy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=559.0s)]
*  All of that reflected in this massive international event, as you say, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=564.0s)]
*  with world leaders here in attendance as well as people from all over Italy and all over the world. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=568.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands expected today, as there were, to pay their respects when the pope lay in state. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=573.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=584.0s)]
*  The Vatican says a quarter of a million people filed past the open coffin of Pope Francis. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=585.0s)]
*  Now that coffin was lying in St Peter's Basilica for three days. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=591.0s)]
*  We saw two nights in fact that the Basilica was left open almost through the night [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=595.0s)]
*  because so many people wanted to file past them to pay their respects. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=601.0s)]
*  So the whole process was adapted in order to accommodate that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=604.0s)]
*  Last night when the authorities closed off the queue, we then saw people again dashing to join the end of it, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=608.0s)]
*  a few people who were let in, extra people who were let in. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=615.0s)]
*  People were really anxious to be able to be part of a historic occasion, but also to say their personal goodbyes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=619.0s)]
*  For Catholics, this is a personal farewell as well. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=625.0s)]
*  It's not just about the institution and the politics and the big picture. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=628.0s)]
*  It's about the way that Pope Francis touched their lives as Catholics. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=632.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's so important for so many people, but also a big political event in the sense that there are so many world leaders gathered around the coffin today. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=636.0s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump is here. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=645.0s)]
*  We've just had confirmation that Vladimir Zelensky has arrived from Ukraine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=647.0s)]
*  Those two men, this will be the first time that they've set eyes on one another [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=651.0s)]
*  ever since that really bruising encounter in the Oval Office a few weeks ago. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=655.0s)]
*  We know that there are monarchs here from, I think, 12 reigning monarchs who are here at the Vatican for this funeral. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=660.0s)]
*  So a really big global occasion as well, of course, as a solemn funeral mass for a pope. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=666.0s)]
*  Sarah, for the moment, thank you very much. Sarah Rainesford, our Rome correspondent. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=672.0s)]
*  Let's speak now to BBC Mundo's Jorge Perez, who joins us live from the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=678.0s)]
*  Jorge, this is a very special place. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=687.0s)]
*  This is where the pope used to pray and where he's chosen to be buried, unusually for a pope. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=690.0s)]
*  It is unusual. It is the first time in more than 100 years that a pope is going to be buried outside the walls of the Vatican City. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=699.0s)]
*  And he chose this place, as you mentioned, the place where he used to pray any visit he made to Rome before being or being elected a pope. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=706.0s)]
*  And there are some curious facts about this church as well, because the pope in 12 years of his leadership in the Catholic Church [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=715.0s)]
*  never had the opportunity to go back to his country, Argentina. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=724.0s)]
*  But coincidentally, the Argentinian embassy here in Rome is just in the backside of this church. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=728.0s)]
*  He didn't mention this in his will, where he said, I want to be buried in this place. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=735.0s)]
*  But it is, of course, a coincidence, a curious fact that can be has some significance, understanding his context. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=740.0s)]
*  Now, this is where obviously Francis's body will be taken after the funeral. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=751.0s)]
*  And it's a very simple tomb that he's chosen. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=758.0s)]
*  It is indeed only going to have his name in Latin, Franciscus. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=765.0s)]
*  And it's going to be open to everybody to visit. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=770.0s)]
*  We are expecting in the upcoming days that people visiting and paying respect to his legacy. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=774.0s)]
*  We've been talking to many Latin Americans, some of them, for example, a woman from Mexico that I talked to. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=780.0s)]
*  She was visiting Italy for tourism reasons. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=785.0s)]
*  And she decided to change her plans and changing her flight ticket back to Mexico because she wanted to be part of the funeral of the leader of the religion she believes in. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=789.0s)]
*  And it is important to understand that, of course, the people that we have encountered here, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=800.0s)]
*  people that are probably going to come to this place in the upcoming hours, most of them, the Latinos we have been talking to adore Pope Francis. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=807.0s)]
*  But this doesn't mean that back in Latin America, he also faced some criticism for the position the church have towards some topics. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=815.0s)]
*  We're talking about women rights. We're talking about same sex unions. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=824.0s)]
*  Despite when he was open about this, it is still something that some progressive, for example, on the progressive side, we're expecting a little bit more from from the church. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=829.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, a sense of pride for many Roman Catholics in Latin America that they produced a pope. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=841.0s)]
*  The image of the pope in Latin in Latin America is that it could be it's not controversial, but is in some extent could be divisive. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=852.0s)]
*  So for some people, as I was mentioning for the progressive people, they were expecting a little bit more from the church to give more rights to to to those that are the less religious. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=860.0s)]
*  And that's why it's less favorable in terms of sex rights or other progressive rights. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=870.0s)]
*  But for the conservatives in Latin America, the pope was just too open for them. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=875.0s)]
*  And not only in this type of matter, but also in the political in the political context and situation that Latin America leaves. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=880.0s)]
*  For example, some leaders in countries or some people in countries like Cuba or Venezuela were expecting their church to be more to stand up for the political freedoms on these countries. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=889.0s)]
*  And and it's it's it was part of the legacy that we are seeing here. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=902.0s)]
*  Someone the first Latin American pope, there were so many expectations from so many different countries. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=908.0s)]
*  But it's the end of an era. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=914.0s)]
*  And at this point, even his biggest detractors and critics are saying that the differences seem to be minor and that he was definitely someone who made an impact for the region. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=916.0s)]
*  What are Roman Catholics in Latin America saying they want from the next pope? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=929.0s)]
*  It is interesting that question because we've been talking to some of them here in Rome and what they say that they expect the next Catholic pope to be as close to people as Pope Francis was. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=936.0s)]
*  This is something that many people mentioned in the different places we've been here in Rome and not only Catholics from from from Latin America. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=949.0s)]
*  I met with a man from from Africa and he was a Muslim and he was mentioning how important it was for him to go to the Vatican and see the post the pope's body because he felt that these religious leader regardless that is not from his religion was close to those that are less favorable in the society to the poor. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=958.0s)]
*  And so if that comes from other faith, you can imagine the message and the and the and the impact that this has in the same Catholic pilgrims that are here. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=981.0s)]
*  They would like to see the church as close to them as Pope Francis was. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=995.0s)]
*  Jorge. Thank you very much indeed. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1000.0s)]
*  Jorge Perez from BBC Mundo live from the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, which is where Pope Francis has chosen to be buried in that simple tomb in the ground with the inscription Franciscus, his chosen name in Latin. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1003.0s)]
*  Thousands of Catholic primary schools around the UK in thousands of schools. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1021.0s)]
*  Children have been remembering Pope Francis this week. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1035.0s)]
*  BBC News round reporter Jenny Lawrence went to one Roman Catholic school in Manchester to find out what Pope Francis has meant to the children. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1038.0s)]
*  This week to remember Pope Francis we've had a special assembly and we're going to have a mass. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1046.0s)]
*  We had a lesson about his life and about what impact it had on the world. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1052.0s)]
*  Me and my family had been thinking about what he did as his time as Pope. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1058.0s)]
*  As assembly as a minute. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1064.0s)]
*  And we did quite thinking about him. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1067.0s)]
*  And finally shows the light. Oh, sweet Jesus. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1071.0s)]
*  These are just some of the ways Catholic children have been marking the life of Pope Francis and at this school in Manchester. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1076.0s)]
*  He's been a big part of their lives and their learning. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1083.0s)]
*  They even have an allotment in their school playground inspired by Pope Francis and his love of caring for the environment. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1087.0s)]
*  To me he means a lot and to all the Catholics in the world really because he's been helping all those countries who are a lot less fortunate. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1094.0s)]
*  He wanted to spread the message of kindness and love all over the world and that's really impacted me to be the best person I can be. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1104.0s)]
*  He means a lot. He's the only Pope that I've known in my life. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1115.0s)]
*  He always tried to be equal with everyone else. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1119.0s)]
*  He didn't want to live in like a big palace or anything. He just lived in an ordinary apartment. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1123.0s)]
*  He really cared about children and he thought they could change the world and that's what I really liked about him. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1131.0s)]
*  And that's inspired you, has it? Yes. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1139.0s)]
*  The children have also been talking about what qualities they would like to see in the next Pope. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1141.0s)]
*  They should be courageous and like confident. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1146.0s)]
*  Caring and very loving towards everybody. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1150.0s)]
*  The Pope has been kind and they should care for children and just love everyone. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1155.0s)]
*  Jenny Lawrence, BBC News, Manchester. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1163.0s)]
*  The Vatican says more than a quarter of a million people came to pay their respects to Pope Francis during the three days he was lying in state at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1167.0s)]
*  On Friday evening, the Pope's coffin was sealed in a private ceremony. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1177.0s)]
*  Several items were placed inside the coffin, including coins minted during his time as Pope and a roguito sealed in a metal cylinder that is a written summary of his life and papacy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1182.0s)]
*  World leaders have been arriving in Rome ahead of Pope Francis' funeral. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1195.0s)]
*  Among them you see there President Trump accompanied by the First Lady Melania. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1198.0s)]
*  It's the President's first overseas trip since returning to the White House in January. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1202.0s)]
*  We can show you the scene there live. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1206.0s)]
*  This is St. Peter's Square for a quiet scene. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1208.0s)]
*  About four in the morning, the funeral is expected to be in in just a matter of hours or so in the open air there on Saturday morning. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1210.0s)]
*  Well, joining me live now is Joe Ferillo, the CEO and publisher of the National Catholic Reporter. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1221.0s)]
*  It's a U.S.-based newspaper that reports on issues related to the Catholic Church. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1227.0s)]
*  We saw the scene there in Rome. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1231.0s)]
*  This funeral expected to begin soon. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1234.0s)]
*  Now, what can we expect? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1236.0s)]
*  What are you anticipating? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1238.0s)]
*  Well, look, we can expect centuries old pageantry, obviously, the things that have been laid out for many, many, many years. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1239.0s)]
*  But viewers can also look for Francis touches the way he has tried to leave his imprint on what you're about to see. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1246.0s)]
*  In the beginning, you'll see the celebration begin in St. Peter's Square. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1253.0s)]
*  The coffin will be there sealed, as you said, but it's that plain wooden coffin, not the ornate as usual for the Pope. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1260.0s)]
*  Then there'll be other parts of the mass that reflect him as well. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1267.0s)]
*  There'll be prayers read in several different languages, French, Arabic, Portuguese, German, Polish, Chinese, many others. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1271.0s)]
*  Another way of a tribute to the Pope for the way he tried to reach out to all the white ends of the world. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1279.0s)]
*  And then there'll be a procession of four kilometer procession from St. Peter's because unlike 91 other posts, Francis will not be buried at St. Peter's. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1285.0s)]
*  He will be buried at St. Mary's. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1294.0s)]
*  You're a four kilometers away, a much more modest church, at least by St. Peter's standards, but his favorite place where he went to pray before and after travel and when he got home from the hospital. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1296.0s)]
*  The final indication of Francis is before he goes into the church, the last folks who will say farewell to him will be a group of the poor and marginalized from Rome. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1307.0s)]
*  People that the Pope had reached out to himself to them personally and had connected with, as he often did in his papacy. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1317.0s)]
*  They will be the last ones to say goodbye and pay their respects. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1325.0s)]
*  So these are the various ways that Francis will leave his imprint even on this centuries old ceremony. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah, he really is leaving his imprint, you know, from everything from from, you know, a coffin instead of a casket to the actual place where he's being buried. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1333.0s)]
*  What was it about Pope Francis where he didn't seem to want the full pomp and circumstance really throughout his papacy, but but, you know, all the way until the end in his funeral. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1341.0s)]
*  You know, I think it was largely his Jesuit training. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1352.0s)]
*  I mean, Jesuits had taken about more poverty and especially being from Latin America. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1355.0s)]
*  The Jesuits there, the church in general, really sits with the poor, really goes out to the disadvantaged and lives and works with them. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1359.0s)]
*  That was the church he grew up in. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1366.0s)]
*  That was the church that he participated in and led. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1368.0s)]
*  And he tried to take that simplicity, that ability to reach people on eye level, but into the papacy. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1371.0s)]
*  So he didn't live in the ornate papal apartments. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1377.0s)]
*  Good morning from St George's Cathedral in London, where like many places across the world, prayers will be said today to mark the day of the Pope's funeral. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1381.0s)]
*  I'm here at St George's where young people who grew up during the Pope's papacy join me. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1391.0s)]
*  And I'm going to be talking to you and finding out about what the Pope's legacy is in your opinion and what he meant to you. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1396.0s)]
*  So let's start with you, David. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1403.0s)]
*  How are you feeling today? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1404.0s)]
*  Sad, but also thankful for everything that the Pope did for us. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1406.0s)]
*  And just sort of spreading love and humility across the global church. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1412.0s)]
*  And so I'm thankful for his life and that he's now sort of at peace and out of pain and just kind of hopeful for what's next for the church. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1420.0s)]
*  Simran, what about you? How are you feeling? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1431.0s)]
*  Feeling very bittersweet, of course. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1435.0s)]
*  We will miss being under his kind leadership, but also love the fact that he lived his life true to God's word and also set a very, very good example for us. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1438.0s)]
*  So bittersweet, but happy that he's at peace now. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1448.0s)]
*  And Daniela, what values did the Pope have that really resonated with you, especially during his papacy? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1451.0s)]
*  So Pope Francis was a very humble and gentle Pope. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1458.0s)]
*  I think one of the things that really speaks to me is his devotion to Our Lady. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1464.0s)]
*  So Our Lady, the mother of God, especially Our Lady, Undoer of Knots. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1470.0s)]
*  I think this is really a value that we should all take forward for the rest of our earthly lives as well. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1475.0s)]
*  I think the value of just being humble and always coming to Our Lady with our problems can really do us a good service for the rest of our lives. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1482.0s)]
*  And Mack, you are a student priest. So what do you take of Pope Francis' legacy? What do you think it is? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1492.0s)]
*  I think he was a bit of a maverick in ways. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1499.0s)]
*  And he had this great phrase where he said, the priest should smell like the flock, smell like the sheep. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1504.0s)]
*  He really wanted to be amongst the people, you know, who really wanted to touch people by word, yes, but also by actions. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1509.0s)]
*  And you know, even towards the end of his life, doctors were saying, you know, you should, you know, stay back from the crowds, rest a bit. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1516.0s)]
*  Immediately he was straight in there talking to the people, seeing how they are, praying for them. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1522.0s)]
*  And that's something that really inspires me, something I, God willing, if I'm called to the priesthood, like to take to it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1526.0s)]
*  And you told me earlier that you saw Pope Francis at World Youth Day in Lisbon. What was that moment like for you? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1531.0s)]
*  It was incredible. Like it was, I've seen him all the time, was sort of YouTube, the news, these different things. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1538.0s)]
*  And we prayed for him. But to see him in person and to see the reaction of the youth, you know, I'm young myself, but World Youth Day, there was those younger. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1545.0s)]
*  And it was, it was like Papa coming home from work. It was absolutely ecstatic. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1552.0s)]
*  And the inspiration that he gave to the people, that's something I won't forget for the rest of my life. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1557.0s)]
*  Now, David, coming back to you, tell me about the values that Pope Francis had that resonate with you, especially. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1561.0s)]
*  Just that he would reach out to everyone to try and help where he could. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1567.0s)]
*  Before the humility, I think he said at one point, who am I to judge? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1572.0s)]
*  And that really speaks to that we shouldn't really judge anyone. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1577.0s)]
*  We should just always be there to help each other when in need, especially if we can. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1582.0s)]
*  And I think he always was there. He could be, even on his last day. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1586.0s)]
*  Simran, tell me about what moment of his papacy will stay with you. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1591.0s)]
*  I think he said a phrase in an interview where he was certain about God's mercy. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1597.0s)]
*  And he said that he believes that hell is empty. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1604.0s)]
*  And I think that moment defines how all of us as Christians, Catholics need to believe in God's mercy, even though we might have rules that we live by and things, commandments that we follow. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1607.0s)]
*  I think that certainty that he placed is something that I will always remember and keep with me. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1618.0s)]
*  And, Daniella, he was the first pope from the Americas. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1623.0s)]
*  What kind of significance do you think that's had on the role of the pope and the Catholic Church? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1627.0s)]
*  So this is a really, really important part about Pope Francis' papacy, is that he's actually elected a significant amount of the cardinals that will be voting in the upcoming conclave. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1633.0s)]
*  I think something like 217 of the past 266 popes have been Italian. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1645.0s)]
*  So I think the changing of the college of cardinals that will actually vote in the next conclave might have a big impact in the diversity that we'll see in a potential future pope. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1650.0s)]
*  And this is something that we're really looking forward to in the church, a bit of fresh air and really a nice thing moving forward. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1665.0s)]
*  And tell me about a moment of his papacy that will stay with you. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1673.0s)]
*  I think one of the main things about Pope Francis that will stay with me is just his kindness and his humility. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1676.0s)]
*  One of the most poignant parts, I think, about his papacy is just how he was working to the end. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1683.0s)]
*  His service really carried through literally until the day before he passed away. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1691.0s)]
*  I think his final Urbi et Orbi blessing was really, really special to me personally. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1695.0s)]
*  I watched it live and especially thinking back to Covid and how we're in an empty St. Peter's Basilica, an empty square, the Vatican's completely empty. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1702.0s)]
*  And in such a great moment of uncertainty, the pope was there, this great figurehead, to come and bless the whole world, even virtually and remotely. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1712.0s)]
*  To do that, I think he showed great courage, great leadership. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1722.0s)]
*  And that's definitely something that will stay with me going forward. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1726.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mack, Daniela, Simran and David, for sharing your thoughts on Pope Francis' papacy with me. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1730.0s)]
*  And I'm sure you're going to be joining others in prayer here later and watching his funeral. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1737.0s)]
*  This was the young people of the Southwark diocese here in London expressing how they feel about Pope Francis' legacy and what they meant to him and the moments that they actually even saw him. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1742.0s)]
*  And as I said, they, like many others across the world, will be saying prayers on today, the day of his funeral. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1754.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1761.0s)]
*  Let's speak to Gerald O'Connell, Vatican correspondent for American magazine, author of The Election of Pope Francis, an inside story of the conclave that changed history. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1763.0s)]
*  Gerald, thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1773.0s)]
*  You knew Pope Francis for many, many years. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1778.0s)]
*  Tell us what he was like as a friend. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1781.0s)]
*  Well, he was a very close friend. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1783.0s)]
*  He was a person who was very interested in your life and what you were doing, what was happening to you. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1786.0s)]
*  He was a person who really felt that reality was more important than the ideas. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1793.0s)]
*  And so he wanted to know exactly what situation people were in. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1799.0s)]
*  I was always struck by his humility, as one of your speakers just said. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1803.0s)]
*  And I remember traveling around the world with him and people, young people, always said the one top quality that they saw in him was his humility. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1808.0s)]
*  And secondly, his care for the poor. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1818.0s)]
*  And I saw this in Buenos Aires when he went into the shanty towns long before becoming Pope. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1821.0s)]
*  And it was an integral part of his way of being a priest. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1828.0s)]
*  He saw himself as the world's parish priest when he became Pope. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1835.0s)]
*  But before that, he was the parish priest of the down trodden, the discarded people of Buenos Aires, later the discarded people of the world. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1839.0s)]
*  And despite leading a church of 1.4 billion followers, he seemed to remember how to remember the individual. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1852.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1862.0s)]
*  I've seen it time and time again. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1864.0s)]
*  I saw it with my own family. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1866.0s)]
*  When my wife was in war in Gaza and Ukraine, he would telephone her. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1868.0s)]
*  He wanted to know what was happening to her, what the situation was. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1873.0s)]
*  He was always concerned about the well-being of the individual. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1878.0s)]
*  I saw it how he cared for the migrants when he went to Lesbos, when he brought them back on the plane with him. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1882.0s)]
*  Muslim migrants from Syria. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1889.0s)]
*  He was concerned with these people. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1892.0s)]
*  He was very disturbed when he goes into prisons and sees people like he did the few days before he died. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1894.0s)]
*  He insisted, even if he was in very poor shape, he insisted on going into the prison in Rome where there's about 1,700 people, most of them inmates, most of them waiting for trial. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1902.0s)]
*  He went in and said, I can't wash your feet like I did before. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1919.0s)]
*  That was his message. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1923.0s)]
*  But now I at least wanted to be close to you in this moment and to let you know that I am praying for you and I ask you to pray for me. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1925.0s)]
*  What do you think today has in store? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1935.0s)]
*  What today has in store? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1941.0s)]
*  Well, we will have the... [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1943.0s)]
*  I'm down in St Peter's Square. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1945.0s)]
*  We're going to have the funeral. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1947.0s)]
*  I think this is going to be an extraordinary occasion. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1949.0s)]
*  We've got heads of state from many, many countries. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1953.0s)]
*  We've got an enormous lot of people. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1957.0s)]
*  I saw a lot of young people coming in this morning. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1960.0s)]
*  And then we're going to have something that hasn't happened in 100 years. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1962.0s)]
*  The body is going to be taken across the city to another church, the Basilica of St. Mary Magi, where he was going to pray always. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1967.0s)]
*  When he came to Rome and before and after his trips. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1976.0s)]
*  And that, I think we're going to see a lot of people on the streets wishing him goodbyes. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1980.0s)]
*  Gerard O'Connell, Vatican correspondent for America magazine. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1986.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1990.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1992.0s)]
*  Father Eamon Conway is a priest of the Archdiocese of Tum in Ireland. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1994.0s)]
*  He's in Rome and I asked him what the atmosphere was like. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=1999.0s)]
*  It's still just just about dawn here. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2003.0s)]
*  But I know already I'm here at the Irish College. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2006.0s)]
*  I hear the noise in the corridors. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2008.0s)]
*  I think many have already departed a little anxious about what the security arrangements will be like and whether it'll be easy or possible to get through into the square. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2010.0s)]
*  A certain amount of confusion, I think, for ordinary people going as to whether they need tickets and whether they'll be able to get there in time, even though it's several hours away from now. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2019.0s)]
*  What does today represent for you? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2029.0s)]
*  It represents, I suppose, a goodbye. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2033.0s)]
*  It's a funeral. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2036.0s)]
*  It's the funeral of the bishop of this diocese, the diocese of Rome. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2037.0s)]
*  It's the end of a particular era in the church. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2041.0s)]
*  I think it's, you know, I've been saying over the last few days, I think it was Pope Francis' time. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2044.0s)]
*  He did a tremendous amount in the last years, you know, the 12 years of his pontificate. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2049.0s)]
*  It was extraordinary, really, what he achieved. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2055.0s)]
*  He himself thought it would be a shorter pontificate. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2058.0s)]
*  I think people will look back and realize it was quite programmatic, that from the very beginning he knew the changes he wished to bring about in the church. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2061.0s)]
*  And now we now get to see, will these changes survive him? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2068.0s)]
*  You know, I think he's done a tremendous amount of good for the renewal of the church. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2072.0s)]
*  But now we have to face the reality. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2076.0s)]
*  We now have to take responsibility for this ourselves. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2078.0s)]
*  And we'll see really whether these changes were of Francis or were of God and of the Holy Spirit, which I believe they were, working through him. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2081.0s)]
*  But now we're going to see whether that's the case or not. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2089.0s)]
*  Because the nature of the church is changing in terms of where it draws its followers from. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2092.0s)]
*  Well, this is very true. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2100.0s)]
*  First of all, I think change to live is to change, as St. John Henry Newman said. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2102.0s)]
*  But the issue is to choose changes that are faithful to the church's mission. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2107.0s)]
*  And as you say, I mean, the biggest reality I think we have to face in the next number of years is that by 2050, we know that something like 75 percent of the world's Catholics will be in those countries we refer to as the Global South. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2112.0s)]
*  And the reality is that if that is the case, most Catholics, most Christians will be living where they're in minority in predominantly Muslim countries, where they're also probably living, many of them living in poverty and indeed many of them perhaps living in fear of persecution. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2127.0s)]
*  So that'll be very much, I think, in the minds of the cardinals as they gather now from all parts of the world. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2145.0s)]
*  How do we prepare ourselves? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2152.0s)]
*  How do we support Catholics, particularly in those countries? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2154.0s)]
*  Well, not abandoning Europe, but Europe in a certain sense is the outlier. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2157.0s)]
*  It's the only continent at the moment that isn't replacing itself with the same number of Catholics, where the growth spurts are in other parts of the world. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2160.0s)]
*  Father Eamon Conway from the Archdiocese of Tum in Ireland. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2169.0s)]
*  Let's speak to Eduardo Jibura Cusala, Bishop of Tambura Iambio in South Sudan. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2174.0s)]
*  And he joins us now from the capital, Juba. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2180.0s)]
*  Bishop Cusala, thank you for joining us here on BBC News on this very important day for the Roman Catholic Church. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2183.0s)]
*  Tell us in your view what sort of leader Pope Francis was. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2191.0s)]
*  Pope Francis was like a new gospel, a new gospel of love, of humility and of peace. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2199.0s)]
*  So he was quite down to earth to anybody. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2210.0s)]
*  So we see him as a new gospel of Christ in our world today. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2214.0s)]
*  How important a figure has he been for South Sudan, particularly during times of conflict? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2221.0s)]
*  Pope Francis has been quite important, quite cardinal for South Sudan because we got independence in 2011 and it didn't take long. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2228.0s)]
*  And when the Pope came in, he picked up on South Sudan and every moment that he was having an audience, he would decide to pray for South Sudan. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2241.0s)]
*  Then when conflict erupted, he decided to invite the political leaders to Rome and pleaded with them to make peace for the country and to unite among themselves. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2253.0s)]
*  And there he did that extraordinary gesture of kissing their feet. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2267.0s)]
*  And kissing their feet meant quite a lot for us in South Sudan. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2274.0s)]
*  And in a way he was commanding them to work for peace. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2279.0s)]
*  How important has he been in bringing people together from different faiths around the world? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2286.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to remember, during his visit in 2023, he came along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and also the representative, the leader for the state of Scotland. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2294.0s)]
*  And they all came down here. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2315.0s)]
*  And that was the first time for a Pope to have an ecumenical travel pilgrimage for peace. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2318.0s)]
*  And that gave us a lot of impetus. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2326.0s)]
*  In fact, it helped us more to stand together in a ecumenical spirit to work for peace. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2329.0s)]
*  And he actually urged all of us that we must hold together. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2337.0s)]
*  Humanity must hold together and we, the people of South Sudan, must hold together in order to bring peace in our country. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2342.0s)]
*  So that meant a lot for us indeed. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2350.0s)]
*  How strong is the appetite in Africa, particularly South Sudan, for another Pope in a similar mould to Pope Francis rather than someone more conservative? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2353.0s)]
*  Yeah, we are all praying and looking forward to having a Pope who is going to continue the journey of Pope Francis, of thinking about the periphery, thinking about the marginalized, and also to be very much close to our continent. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2366.0s)]
*  And you know, it is quite a fast-growing Catholic community in Africa now. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2387.0s)]
*  And we would like a Pope, surely we will have to work in the same pace as Pope Francis, of helping and working together with the local church here, building peace, building unity, and also making a community of people who value environment and taking care of it. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2393.0s)]
*  Bishop Eduardo Hibbera-Kasala from South Sudan, thank you so much for joining us from Juba. Thank you. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2416.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And I'm talking to you from Yambio. All the best. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2424.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2429.0s)]
*  The funeral of Pope Francis takes place later today. More than 100 countries are sending delegations to the service and at least 50 heads of state will also be there. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2433.0s)]
*  The Pope died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke following a long period of ill health. Officials expect at least a quarter of a million people will attend the funeral as well. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2444.0s)]
*  It begins at 10am local time when the coffin will be laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. The service will be led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prince William will represent King Charles III. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2456.0s)]
*  Other senior international figures attending the funeral are President Trump, Prime Minister Sequeira Starmer, the French President Emmanuel Macron, King Felipe of Spain and Brazil's President Luis Inacio Lula de Silva. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2469.0s)]
*  Sarah Rainsford reports from the Vatican. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2482.0s)]
*  Arriving for the funeral of a Pope. There will be dozens of dignitaries and world leaders in the Vatican today. Here to pay their respects to the leader of a church with huge reach and great influence. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2486.0s)]
*  Pope Francis lay in state in St Peter's Basilica for three days. There was a chance for Catholics to say their goodbyes after his sudden death from a stroke. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2500.0s)]
*  In the end, a quarter of a million people filed past his coffin. Then on Friday, as the sun began to dip, the queue to see the Pope was closed. Time to let the church prepare him for burial. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2511.0s)]
*  They've just let a few more people into the queue now. You know, the sheer number of people who want to take part in this to come and pay their respects at the coffin of Pope Francis is a sign not only of how important this moment is for the Catholic Church, but how important it is personally for all of the Catholics taking part. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2526.0s)]
*  Levine from Australia told me he was one of the last to make it inside. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2544.0s)]
*  We actually booked for a papal blessing on last Wednesday. So with the condition we couldn't be able to see the Pope on that day. It was our dream to see the Pope, to see him alive, but I can't. So we came here for pray. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2549.0s)]
*  The French president and his wife got to say their goodbyes to standing beside the open coffin. And last night, Donald Trump landed in Rome on his first foreign trip since reelection. He's here even though Pope Francis once called his policy on migrants disgraceful. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2566.0s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky is also expected from Ukraine. The Pope became controversial there when he resisted naming Russia as the aggressor and he once suggested Kiev might wave the white flag of surrender. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2585.0s)]
*  But many Catholics who will crowd into these streets for his funeral will come to commemorate a people's Pope, a man who wanted a humbler, simpler church and asked for his own funeral to be the same. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2599.0s)]
*  Sarah Rainesford, BBC News, at the Vatican. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2613.0s)]
*  Well, let's join my colleague, Mariam Mishiri, who's at the Vatican this morning and already the square filling up, Mariam. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2617.0s)]
*  Absolutely, Martin. I don't know if you can see behind me, there's crowds and crowds and crowds of people who from very early this morning were running literally down the via della Consigliazione to get to the main square. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2627.0s)]
*  We're a little bit down the way. Say hello, everyone. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2641.0s)]
*  So everyone's very keen to say hi to the world on BBC News. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2645.0s)]
*  We have people here from all over the world, from so many different parishes, churches, groups. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2650.0s)]
*  We have people from Switzerland, from France, from northern Italy, from everywhere. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2657.0s)]
*  And one person who I'm joined here now by is Paola, an emergency worker. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2661.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2666.0s)]
*  Paola, tell me how many people are we expecting here today? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2667.0s)]
*  Today is very, very...my heart is very hurt because the Pope isn't here. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2670.0s)]
*  But our Pope is the Pope of the people in Italy and on the world, I think. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2681.0s)]
*  And my heart is full, very full. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2692.0s)]
*  Very full. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2698.0s)]
*  How many people will come today? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2699.0s)]
*  I think 500,000. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2702.0s)]
*  Thousands? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2704.0s)]
*  Many, many. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2705.0s)]
*  500,000? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2706.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. Yes. Very, very good people here because there are many young people. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2707.0s)]
*  And today is all the world here, with me, with you, with our people, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2717.0s)]
*  because our Pope is very interesting for the big people, but also the power, the little people. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2727.0s)]
*  It's a big, big, big Pope. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2740.0s)]
*  Paola, thank you very much indeed for that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2745.0s)]
*  And that's the feeling I'm getting from so many of these people here. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2748.0s)]
*  They're so excited. They're so grateful. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2751.0s)]
*  There's no sadness here. People are in almost a celebratory mood, Martine. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2753.0s)]
*  They want to come here to remember the Pope, to celebrate his life. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2758.0s)]
*  Now, just to give you an idea of what's going to happen later, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2761.0s)]
*  up there behind me is St Peter's Basilica. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2765.0s)]
*  Outside that basilica, in the main square, the funeral will be held, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2768.0s)]
*  so all the dignitaries, heads of state, the 170 different delegations from all around the world, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2772.0s)]
*  cardinals and bishops and priests will all sit outside while the ceremony takes place. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2778.0s)]
*  After that, the Pope's body will then be moved by procession to his final resting place in Santa Maria Maggiore, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2783.0s)]
*  the basilica that he himself chose to be buried in. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2790.0s)]
*  The funeral will last probably about an hour and a half. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2794.0s)]
*  It's going to be a much more streamlined event compared to funerals we've seen in the past, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2797.0s)]
*  but I can tell you now the enthusiasm and the desire to come and say goodbye to the Pope is still here. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2802.0s)]
*  Can I ask you guys, where are you guys all from? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2808.0s)]
*  Sardinia. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2811.0s)]
*  And why are you here? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2813.0s)]
*  Because we're here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2815.0s)]
*  And you guys are from Tuscany? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2822.0s)]
*  Florence. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2824.0s)]
*  It's from Florence. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2826.0s)]
*  Do you speak English? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2828.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2830.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2834.0s)]
*  Alessandra. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2835.0s)]
*  Alessandra is here with me. Alessandra, why are you here? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2836.0s)]
*  To see the Pope and to view the Vatican and to enjoy this day. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2839.0s)]
*  Where have you come from? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2850.0s)]
*  Napoli. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2851.0s)]
*  So a couple of hours from here, not very far from here. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2853.0s)]
*  Was the Pope important to you? What did he mean to you? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2856.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. And for all my family. I am here to represent all my family. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2862.0s)]
*  It's really sad for this moment. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2871.0s)]
*  Alessandra, thank you very much indeed. Alessandra, Paula, all of the people here are just a little microcosm of the huge crowd. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2878.0s)]
*  And as we heard earlier from Paula, the emergency worker, we're expecting maybe half a million people to line the streets. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2887.0s)]
*  So I'm going to hand back to you now, Martin, and just everyone say goodbye to BBC News from the crowds. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2894.0s)]
*  Let's go to Soweto now and speak to South African correspondent, Pumza Filani, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2899.0s)]
*  and a huge number of people turning to Catholicism in Africa. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2906.0s)]
*  And this is really where the Catholic Church is going to be centered in the future in many respects, Pumza. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2912.0s)]
*  It certainly looks like it. If we're looking at just the numbers alone, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2921.0s)]
*  currently just over 280 million people are spread across Africa. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2925.0s)]
*  And it's said to be one of the few places around the world where Catholicism is growing. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2931.0s)]
*  We're seeing more and more young people, especially joining the church from different parts of the continent, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2936.0s)]
*  seeing the church as a place where they can have their voice heard, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2941.0s)]
*  or at least a place where they can bring some of their problems and hope that those problems are communicated further up the chain. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2945.0s)]
*  It certainly is why there seems to have been a real resonance in Africa from Pope Francis' message. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2951.0s)]
*  Certainly, he was seen by many Africans as somebody who was incredibly relatable, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2963.0s)]
*  somebody whose heart was close to the heart of the poor and understood some of the real struggles [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2968.0s)]
*  that many Africans have been facing in Africa. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2974.0s)]
*  He was seen to have a soft spot in advocating for those people. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2978.0s)]
*  He was also seen as somebody who was not afraid to say the uncomfortable thing. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2983.0s)]
*  He even most recently spoke about the church looking at embracing blessing same-sex marriages. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2987.0s)]
*  Of course, this caused controversy in some parts of Africa, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2993.0s)]
*  but it was also a very important part of Africa. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=2997.0s)]
*  And it's a very important part of Africa. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3000.0s)]
*  He was seen as somebody who was willing to have those difficult conversations [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3004.0s)]
*  and advocate for open conversations in the church, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3009.0s)]
*  and somebody who was wanting some kind of open conversation with the church. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3013.0s)]
*  He was seen as somebody who was willing to have those conversations [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3018.0s)]
*  and advocate for open conversations in the church, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3023.0s)]
*  and somebody who was willing to have those conversations with the church. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3027.0s)]
*  And somebody who was wanting society to be reflected in the church, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3031.0s)]
*  that he understood that the world is changing, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3036.0s)]
*  and that perhaps with that change, open and frank conversations should be happening [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3039.0s)]
*  about where the countries are individually going and where they all fit in in the global community. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3043.0s)]
*  Well, we've seen a number of services over the last few days, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3055.0s)]
*  with a few expected to continue. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3059.0s)]
*  Just outside here, Regina Mundi, which is the largest church here in South Africa, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3061.0s)]
*  they're planning on having a memorial service over the next few days, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3066.0s)]
*  where they're not only expecting to welcome Sowetans, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3069.0s)]
*  but people from around Southern Africa to come and pay their respects [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3072.0s)]
*  and use it also as a time to just celebrate the Pope's celebration, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3077.0s)]
*  the Pope's life rather, to the body of the church, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3081.0s)]
*  but also the greater African community. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3085.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Pums of Fulani, in Soweto. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3089.0s)]
*  Hello and welcome, I'm Martine Croxall. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3107.0s)]
*  Crowds are gathering in St Peter's Square for the funeral of Pope Francis, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3110.0s)]
*  which takes place in about an hour's time. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3114.0s)]
*  More than 100 countries are sending delegations to the service [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3117.0s)]
*  and at least 50 heads of state will be attending. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3120.0s)]
*  The Pope died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3123.0s)]
*  following a long period of ill health. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3127.0s)]
*  Officials expect at least a quarter of a million people to attend the funeral as well. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3130.0s)]
*  It starts at 10am local time, when the coffin will be laid in the square [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3134.0s)]
*  in front of St Peter's Basilica. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3138.0s)]
*  The service will be led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3140.0s)]
*  Prince William will represent King Charles III. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3144.0s)]
*  Other senior international figures attending the funeral are President Trump, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3147.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Sikir Starmer, the French President Emmanuel Macron, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3151.0s)]
*  King Felipe of Spain and Brazil's President Luis Inácio Lula de Silva. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3155.0s)]
*  We begin our coverage with Sarah Rainsford reporting from the Vatican. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3160.0s)]
*  Arriving for the funeral of a Pope, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3166.0s)]
*  there will be dozens of dignitaries and world leaders in the Vatican today. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3169.0s)]
*  Here to pay their respects to the leader of a church with huge reach and great influence. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3173.0s)]
*  Pope Francis lay in state in St Peter's Basilica for three days. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3180.0s)]
*  It was a chance for Catholics to say their goodbyes after his sudden death from a stroke. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3184.0s)]
*  In the end, a quarter of a million people filed past his coffin. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3190.0s)]
*  Then on Friday, as the sun began to dip, the queue to see the Pope was closed. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3196.0s)]
*  Time to let the church prepare him for burial. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3202.0s)]
*  I've just let a few more people into the queue now. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3206.0s)]
*  You know, the sheer number of people who want to take part in this, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3209.0s)]
*  to come and pay their respects at the coffin of Pope Francis, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3213.0s)]
*  is a sign not only of how important this moment is for the Catholic Church, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3216.0s)]
*  but how important it is personally for all of the Catholics taking part. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3220.0s)]
*  Levine from Australia told me he was one of the last to make it inside. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3224.0s)]
*  We actually booked for a papal blessing on last Wednesday. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3228.0s)]
*  So with the condition we couldn't be able to see the Pope on that day. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3231.0s)]
*  It was our dream to see the Pope, to see him alive, but I can't. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3235.0s)]
*  So we came here for pray. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3242.0s)]
*  The French president and his wife got to say their goodbyes too, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3245.0s)]
*  standing beside the open coffin. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3249.0s)]
*  And last night, Donald Trump landed in Rome, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3252.0s)]
*  on his first foreign trip since re-election. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3255.0s)]
*  He's here even though Pope Francis once called his policy on migrants disgraceful. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3258.0s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky is also expected from Ukraine. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3264.0s)]
*  The Pope became controversial there when he resisted naming Russia as the aggressor, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3268.0s)]
*  and he once suggested Kiev might wave the white flag of surrender. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3273.0s)]
*  But many Catholics who will crowd into these streets for his funeral, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3278.0s)]
*  will come to commemorate a people's Pope. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3282.0s)]
*  A man who wanted a humbler, simpler church, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3285.0s)]
*  and asked for his own funeral to be the same. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3289.0s)]
*  Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, at the Vatican. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3292.0s)]
*  Well, the funeral of Pope Francis would be simpler than those of previous popes, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3297.0s)]
*  following instructions that he set out himself. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3301.0s)]
*  But as a head of state and leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3304.0s)]
*  it will still be a spectacle of ceremony and tradition. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3308.0s)]
*  So, how will the day unfold? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3311.0s)]
*  Well, Pope Francis has been lying in state since Wednesday [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3313.0s)]
*  inside St Peter's Basilica in the heart of Vatican City, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3316.0s)]
*  where tens of thousands of people have queued to say a final goodbye before the funeral. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3320.0s)]
*  The mass will take place at 10am local time in Rome, in front of St Peter's Basilica. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3325.0s)]
*  At least 170 heads of state or government will be attending, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3331.0s)]
*  according to the Mayor of Rome's office. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3334.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of mourners are also expected to gather in St Peter's Square. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3337.0s)]
*  After a concluding prayer, formally entrusting the Pope to God, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3342.0s)]
*  a procession will take place to move the pontiff to be buried in St Mary Major Basilica, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3346.0s)]
*  which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3351.0s)]
*  The burial will take place in the evening. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3355.0s)]
*  Pope Francis asked that his tomb be in the ground, simple, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3357.0s)]
*  and bearing only the inscription, Franciscus, the Latin version of his chosen name. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3361.0s)]
*  In the weeks that follow, the process of selecting a new pope, known as the Conclave, will then take place. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3366.0s)]
*  Cardinals are cut off from the outside world to vote in a secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3371.0s)]
*  A new pope is elected when a candidate has secured the support of 90 cardinals, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3377.0s)]
*  which can take several rounds of voting over days, weeks or even months. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3382.0s)]
*  My colleague, Marion Micheri, is at the Vatican, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3387.0s)]
*  and she joins us now surrounded by the crowds, Marion. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3390.0s)]
*  Yes, Martine. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3397.0s)]
*  From very early this morning, the crowds have been arriving here at the Via delle Consolizioni, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3399.0s)]
*  which is the main road that leads up to St Peter's Basilica. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3403.0s)]
*  You can see that behind me. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3407.0s)]
*  At various points, authorities open the barriers, and the crowd surges forward [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3409.0s)]
*  to get as good a view as they can of the funeral of Pope Francis, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3413.0s)]
*  which will take place inside the square in front of the main basilica. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3417.0s)]
*  Luckily, it's a lovely day, and there are absolutely tens of thousands of people here. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3421.0s)]
*  And I have to say, Martine, there are so many young people here. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3425.0s)]
*  One of the reasons for that is that these few days should have been [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3428.0s)]
*  the jubilee celebrations for the youth, Catholic youth. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3432.0s)]
*  That's what was planned originally in the Rome Diary, the Vatican Diary. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3437.0s)]
*  Of course, those who've come here for that now find themselves here for a funeral. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3441.0s)]
*  So there is a large amount of young people. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3447.0s)]
*  There's a lot of singing. There's a lot of celebration. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3450.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel like a funeral. It feels more like, I don't know, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3452.0s)]
*  a celebration of someone's life. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3456.0s)]
*  Let's talk to a few of these young people who are here. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3458.0s)]
*  We have Alice and Lorenzo who are here. Alice, where have you come from? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3461.0s)]
*  Florence. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3466.0s)]
*  And why are you here? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3467.0s)]
*  Because we're here for a jubilee, but our programs changed for this bad news. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3469.0s)]
*  And we're here to celebrate the funeral of Pope Francis. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3478.0s)]
*  But I think it's a really good thing to see all those people reunited [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3483.0s)]
*  for this important figure. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3491.0s)]
*  Lorenzo, how about you? How do you feel today? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3494.0s)]
*  I feel happy. I don't feel sad. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3497.0s)]
*  Because I say goodbye to Pope Francis and I'm proud of this. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3504.0s)]
*  Fantastic. And Alice, your mum, she met Pope Francis. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3514.0s)]
*  Yes. I think two years ago. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3518.0s)]
*  And she said he was a really good person. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3524.0s)]
*  And she was really happy to meet him and my father too. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3532.0s)]
*  So you're going to be here for the funeral. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3539.0s)]
*  Are you going to watch the funeral and then afterwards go back to Florence? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3541.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3544.0s)]
*  And how many groups, how many of you are here? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3545.0s)]
*  There's a big group of you. Can we turn around and have a look? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3548.0s)]
*  Say hello, everyone. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3550.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3551.0s)]
*  There's a big group. They come from a parish, the parish of Castaldo. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3552.0s)]
*  Some of them are actually a bit tired. Let's just put it that way. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3557.0s)]
*  Some of them are a bit tired. They're not in the mood. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3560.0s)]
*  But as I was saying, the mood here is one really of jubilation. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3563.0s)]
*  People feel a lot of gratitude towards Pope Francis. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3568.0s)]
*  I've spoken to people who have come here all the way from Vietnam. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3571.0s)]
*  I've spoken to people from Switzerland, from Germany. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3574.0s)]
*  I spoke to someone who's come here from Austria. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3577.0s)]
*  It really is a huge group of people from all around the world who want [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3579.0s)]
*  to come and pay their respects. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3584.0s)]
*  And one of the main feelings you get here is that people felt that [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3586.0s)]
*  Pope Francis spoke to them. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3590.0s)]
*  He spoke to the issues that were important to them. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3592.0s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why he touched so many hearts. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3595.0s)]
*  Paola, who was working for the emergency services here in the St Peter [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3598.0s)]
*  Square, said to me earlier when I spoke to her, she said that he [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3602.0s)]
*  touched the hearts of so many, we called him the people's pope. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3606.0s)]
*  And that really is the feeling that you get from speaking to people [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3610.0s)]
*  here, Martin. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3613.0s)]
*  Marion, thank you very much. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3614.0s)]
*  Let's speak to our Rome correspondent, Sarah Rainsford. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3616.0s)]
*  As Marion was saying, a really international crowd flocking to the [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3619.0s)]
*  Vatican. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3624.0s)]
*  And quite a race for some people to get a good spot. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3625.0s)]
*  Very early this morning as we were heading here to the street that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3630.0s)]
*  leads up to St Peter's Square, we saw nuns and priests dashing across [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3635.0s)]
*  the cobblestones to try to make it to the square to secure their place [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3640.0s)]
*  ahead of the funeral mass, which is going to start in less than an hour [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3644.0s)]
*  now. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3648.0s)]
*  But there's a really big crowd building, as Marion was just saying. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3649.0s)]
*  I can see lots of people sitting on the steps just behind the camera [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3652.0s)]
*  over there along the River Tiber. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3655.0s)]
*  And of course, all of this road leading down to the square filling [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3657.0s)]
*  up full of people. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3661.0s)]
*  There are lots of national flags that I've spotted. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3662.0s)]
*  I saw the Lebanese flag flying over one group of pilgrims heading down [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3665.0s)]
*  towards the mass gathering just down the street. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3669.0s)]
*  I've seen other countries, too. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3672.0s)]
*  There was a man from Capo Verde who had just joined the crowd. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3674.0s)]
*  He said he came here especially all the way from his own country to be [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3677.0s)]
*  here. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3681.0s)]
*  A big group of Americans, too. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3682.0s)]
*  And also, as you were just hearing, lots of young Catholics from [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3684.0s)]
*  parishes and dioceses all over Italy. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3688.0s)]
*  We spoke to one group who had come from Modena in the north. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3691.0s)]
*  They were all wearing bizarre comedy hats. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3694.0s)]
*  And I said, you know, why are you dressed like that for a funeral? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3697.0s)]
*  They said, look, this is a massive crowd. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3700.0s)]
*  We need to be able to find each other in that crowd. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3702.0s)]
*  So they came with a special headgear to make sure that nobody got lost, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3704.0s)]
*  because it is a big, big gathering. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3708.0s)]
*  Lots of Catholics down here on the ground. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3710.0s)]
*  And, of course, in the next moments, we'll see the international [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3712.0s)]
*  leaders, those big delegations that are here from many countries [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3716.0s)]
*  around the world, world leaders, monarchs, royal family members, but [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3720.0s)]
*  also broader delegations of ministers and other officials who are here to [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3725.0s)]
*  take part in this funeral mass. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3729.0s)]
*  Yeah, those comedy hats are really at odds with the sheer number of [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3732.0s)]
*  dignitaries who are flying in from all over the world to take part. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3736.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think reflective of the general mood here. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3741.0s)]
*  You know, this is a funeral, but it is also the celebration of a man's [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3744.0s)]
*  life, the celebration of a man who led the Catholic Church for more than [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3747.0s)]
*  12 years and who is outheld very fondly in people's hearts. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3751.0s)]
*  And I think it also reflects the kind of the spirit of the church under [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3755.0s)]
*  Francis. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3759.0s)]
*  You know, he wasn't a man for pomp and circumstance and ceremony, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3760.0s)]
*  despite the fact, of course, there'll be a lot of that here today. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3763.0s)]
*  He was a much simpler person. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3766.0s)]
*  He was a much simpler pope. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3769.0s)]
*  He was a man who famously got somebody to pay the paperboy back in [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3772.0s)]
*  Argentina when he was elected 12 years ago. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3776.0s)]
*  He lived in the Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican residence where other [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3779.0s)]
*  clergy members live because he wanted to be closer to people. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3784.0s)]
*  He didn't want to be all on his own up in the fancy apartments that [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3788.0s)]
*  popes normally live in within the Vatican. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3792.0s)]
*  And I think it also reflected in the fact that the mood as people [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3795.0s)]
*  gather here is calm, is relaxed, is almost celebratory in some senses [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3798.0s)]
*  because people are remembering the life of the pope, not just the fact [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3802.0s)]
*  that he has died. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3805.0s)]
*  For the moment, Sarah, thank you very much. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3807.0s)]
*  Sarah Rainesford, our Rome correspondent. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3810.0s)]
*  Well, joining us now from Soweto is our correspondent, Pumza Filani. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3812.0s)]
*  How are Roman Catholics in South Africa marking today, Pumza? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3816.0s)]
*  We sing this celebration of the pope's life here in South Africa. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3820.0s)]
*  He's being remembered as somebody who sued for the truth, who said at [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3824.0s)]
*  times the thing that was uncomfortable but needed to be said to create [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3828.0s)]
*  closeness across various communities. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3832.0s)]
*  Over the last few days, there have been masses across the country and [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3835.0s)]
*  in different parts of Africa as well. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3838.0s)]
*  And just where we are, outside the Regina Mundi Church, one of the [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3841.0s)]
*  largest Catholic churches in the country, is the Pumza Filani. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3844.0s)]
*  He's being remembered as somebody who sued for the truth, who said at [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3848.0s)]
*  times the thing that was uncomfortable but needed to be said to create [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3852.0s)]
*  closeness across various communities. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3855.0s)]
*  And just where we are, outside the Regina Mundi Church, one of the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3858.0s)]
*  largest Catholic churches in the country, they're planning on holding [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3861.0s)]
*  yet another remembrance celebration for him over the next few days. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3864.0s)]
*  It's going to be a ceremony that's not just open to Catholic members and [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3867.0s)]
*  the people of Soweto, but people around the country. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3870.0s)]
*  And they're saying that this is the best way to honor him because he's [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3873.0s)]
*  been a part of this for a long time. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3876.0s)]
*  And they're saying that this is one of the ways that they're planning on [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3879.0s)]
*  honoring his life while continuing his legacy. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3882.0s)]
*  How deeply did that message of Pope Francis, particularly focusing on [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3885.0s)]
*  people at the margins of society, resonate in South Africa? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3888.0s)]
*  It's resonated deep, not just in South Africa, but across Africa. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3891.0s)]
*  And with good reason. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3894.0s)]
*  We all know that often when we sing stories of marginalized communities, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3897.0s)]
*  they tend to come from African countries. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3900.0s)]
*  The issues around refugee status, around the displacement of people, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3903.0s)]
*  around questions around LGBTQ rights, which are at the heart of some of [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3906.0s)]
*  contentious conversations, not just in South Africa, but across the [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3909.0s)]
*  African continent. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3912.0s)]
*  And these are issues, though, that Pope Francis did not shy away from. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3915.0s)]
*  He spoke about them with kindness, with openness, and frankly, and saying [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3918.0s)]
*  the church needed to be more responsive to the world as it was in the [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3921.0s)]
*  beginning. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3924.0s)]
*  And he spoke about the church as a church that needed to be more [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3927.0s)]
*  responsive to the world as it is today. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3930.0s)]
*  And that is why he is at the heart of many Africans. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3933.0s)]
*  And as they mourn his life, they continue then to celebrate that legacy [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3936.0s)]
*  and hope that the person that is voted in will be somebody that will [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3939.0s)]
*  equally have a heart, not just for Africans, but other marginalized [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3942.0s)]
*  communities and be a voice of the poor in the Vatican. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3945.0s)]
*  The Roman Catholic Church is growing so fast across Africa. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3948.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3951.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3954.0s)]
*  So, the Roman Catholic Church is growing so fast across Africa. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3957.0s)]
*  How much do people want an African pope? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3960.0s)]
*  So, this depends on who you speak to. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3963.0s)]
*  There is a big part of the population that does want to see an African [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3966.0s)]
*  pope. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3969.0s)]
*  But they are saying, though, it's not just about having a black face in [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3972.0s)]
*  the Vatican. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3975.0s)]
*  It is more about representation. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3978.0s)]
*  It is believing that if a person who comes from here is in the Vatican, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3981.0s)]
*  this is somebody who understands the issues and the different nuances of [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3984.0s)]
*  the various African countries and will be able to be a voice for those [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3987.0s)]
*  countries. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3990.0s)]
*  But they are saying, though, although they believe it's high time this [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3993.0s)]
*  happens, because the last time there was a black pope in the Vatican, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3996.0s)]
*  it's around 1,500 years ago. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=3999.0s)]
*  So, many people don't even, very few people know that this even happened. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4002.0s)]
*  But they are believing now that if this were to happen, it would represent a [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4005.0s)]
*  change also in how the Church is embracing the Vatican. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4008.0s)]
*  But also saying that that huge number of the Catholic faith, which is [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4011.0s)]
*  around 280 million people, really should be given a voice in the Vatican. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4014.0s)]
*  And if that comes through a black pope, all the better for it. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4017.0s)]
*  There are some commentators who say there could be an appetite for a more [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4020.0s)]
*  conservative pope, particularly in parts of Africa. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4023.0s)]
*  So, I think that's a good point. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4026.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4029.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4032.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4035.0s)]
*  Well, that is also something that is on the table. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4038.0s)]
*  But if we were going just solely on Pope Francis' own legacy and how he used [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4041.0s)]
*  his platform to speak about openness, to speak about embracing different ideas, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4044.0s)]
*  to speak about responding to society as it is, then the proper legacy, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4047.0s)]
*  some people would say, would be to find a pope who is able to straddle the [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4050.0s)]
*  lines between tradition but also respond to the needs of society. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4053.0s)]
*  And that's a good point. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4056.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4059.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4062.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4065.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4068.0s)]
*  To straddle the lines between tradition but also respond to the very serious [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4071.0s)]
*  needs of a world that needs to change and perhaps catch up with the times [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4074.0s)]
*  around the areas of division and around the areas of racism, for example, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4077.0s)]
*  around the areas of sexism, which is something that the pope was known to [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4080.0s)]
*  advocate against. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4083.0s)]
*  Pumza, for the moment, thank you very much. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4086.0s)]
*  Pumza Filani in Soweto. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4089.0s)]
*  We're in the capital of the country, the Philippines. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4092.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Jonathan Head is in the capital of Manila. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4095.0s)]
*  Pope Francis visited the country in 2015, becoming the third pontiff [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4098.0s)]
*  to do so. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4101.0s)]
*  So how are Catholics there marking the life and death of Pope Francis? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4104.0s)]
*  In lots of different ways. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4107.0s)]
*  I've come down to what you can see behind me. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4110.0s)]
*  This is the Pope Mobile. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4113.0s)]
*  There were actually three of them made for the pope's visit here. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4116.0s)]
*  This is a very old visit. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4119.0s)]
*  It's been 10 years ago, but it is still really vividly remembered, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4122.0s)]
*  particularly by all those who got close to Pope Francis during that [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4125.0s)]
*  visit. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4128.0s)]
*  People are very devout here. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4131.0s)]
*  There's a particularly intense and colourful form of Catholicism [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4134.0s)]
*  that's followed in the Philippines. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4137.0s)]
*  Around 80% of the population say they belong to the Roman Catholic faith, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4140.0s)]
*  so the papal visit was a big event for them. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4143.0s)]
*  This is the church of the Pope. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4146.0s)]
*  It's very characteristic in here. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4149.0s)]
*  The pope sat in the back and toured around Manila when he was here. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4152.0s)]
*  This has been brought out here so people can come down. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4155.0s)]
*  There's a little shrine behind it where people have been lighting [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4158.0s)]
*  candles and a large cutout of Pope Francis there. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4161.0s)]
*  We're seeing this right across the country. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4164.0s)]
*  Almost every church has either a chapel or a small space put aside [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4167.0s)]
*  with images of Pope Francis and places where people can light [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4170.0s)]
*  candles and say prayers and leave messages as well for him. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4173.0s)]
*  There will be some masses today. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4176.0s)]
*  These are masses that would have been held anyway. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4179.0s)]
*  They've been adapted to coincide with the funeral, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4182.0s)]
*  and they are being masses now explicitly, requiem masses for the [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4185.0s)]
*  pope. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4188.0s)]
*  People are also thinking very hard about the impact that Pope Francis [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4191.0s)]
*  had. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4194.0s)]
*  People really felt that he was something different, that he brought [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4197.0s)]
*  people back to the faith. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4200.0s)]
*  He was able to reach out to many people who got rather distant to [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4203.0s)]
*  the church. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4206.0s)]
*  For all Filipinos who are very devout, only just over a third of [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4209.0s)]
*  them say they go to mass every week. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4212.0s)]
*  Numbers who go to church are dropping. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4215.0s)]
*  The church is very worried about this. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4218.0s)]
*  They do believe that Pope Francis' example and the kinds of humorous, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4221.0s)]
*  informal messaging that he put out have helped bring some people back [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4224.0s)]
*  to the faith. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4227.0s)]
*  What kind of pope do you think they want next? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4229.0s)]
*  Who do they want to take over from Pope Francis? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4232.0s)]
*  Bearing in mind the legacy that you just mentioned. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4235.0s)]
*  One of the front runners is indeed a Filipino cardinal, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4238.0s)]
*  Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4241.0s)]
*  There is quiet excitement at the possibility that there is a real [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4244.0s)]
*  chance we could see a Filipino pope. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4247.0s)]
*  I think it depends where you fall on the various schools of thought [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4250.0s)]
*  about the Catholic Church. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4253.0s)]
*  There are conservatives here too who felt perhaps a little [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4256.0s)]
*  uncomfortable with some of the forthright messaging, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4259.0s)]
*  rather blunt messaging of Pope Francis and his insistence on being [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4262.0s)]
*  very open to everybody. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4265.0s)]
*  But there are others here. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4268.0s)]
*  I think some of the most committed priests are very socially active. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4271.0s)]
*  You could say they were influenced to some degree by what we call [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4274.0s)]
*  liberation theology. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4277.0s)]
*  They felt in Pope Francis they had real support, particularly in [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4280.0s)]
*  the brutal drug war carried out here by the previous Duterte [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4283.0s)]
*  administration. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4286.0s)]
*  Thousands of people were killed. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4289.0s)]
*  Many of the priests who spoke out against that were threatened by [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4292.0s)]
*  the government, had death threats as well. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4295.0s)]
*  They felt that Pope Francis was really behind them and that he [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4298.0s)]
*  laid the groundwork for the church to get more up to date with [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4301.0s)]
*  changing social values. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4304.0s)]
*  The church here like everywhere, the Catholic Church has opposed [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4307.0s)]
*  family planning, which the Philippines badly needs and is now [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4310.0s)]
*  legal and available here. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4313.0s)]
*  They oppose divorce. This is a very contentious issue here. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4316.0s)]
*  Some of those priests say we do at least need to have a conversation [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4319.0s)]
*  about being more flexible on these doctrines and they really hope [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4322.0s)]
*  that the next Pope will be somebody in the same vein as Francis. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4325.0s)]
*  Although I think they acknowledge that among all the candidates [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4328.0s)]
*  and the cardinals, there's perhaps no one who quite has that [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4331.0s)]
*  very quirky personality that Pope Francis had. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4334.0s)]
*  Jonathan had our correspondent speaking to us earlier from Manila, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4337.0s)]
*  the capital of the Philippines. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4340.0s)]
*  Well, this is the live pictures from the Vatican and as you can see, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4343.0s)]
*  there's this cavalcade of cars bringing the many dignitaries [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4346.0s)]
*  and world leaders to Pope Francis' funeral. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4349.0s)]
*  We understand that more than 100 countries are sending delegations [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4352.0s)]
*  to the service and some 170 heads of state or government are [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4355.0s)]
*  being sent to the service. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4358.0s)]
*  So, we're very happy to have you here. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4361.0s)]
*  We understand that more than 100 countries are sending delegations [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4364.0s)]
*  to the service and some 170 heads of state or government will be [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4367.0s)]
*  in attendance and 12 reigning monarchs at the last count as well. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4370.0s)]
*  We understand that President Trump has also arrived in Rome. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4373.0s)]
*  It's his first foreign trip in his second term of office. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4376.0s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine arrived on Saturday morning as well [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4379.0s)]
*  according to his spokesman. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4382.0s)]
*  It was thought that he might miss the funeral because yesterday he [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4385.0s)]
*  had said that there were many military people who had been [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4388.0s)]
*  there. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4391.0s)]
*  He is going to be there with the First Lady. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4394.0s)]
*  And reports that Joe Biden has been seen arriving as well. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4397.0s)]
*  The former US President of course with the former First Lady, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4400.0s)]
*  his wife Jill. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4403.0s)]
*  A real mix though at this funeral, bringing together some of the [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4406.0s)]
*  world's most powerful people with some of those who are most [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4409.0s)]
*  marginalised, people who are homeless, migrants, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4412.0s)]
*  people who are in the middle of the world. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4415.0s)]
*  But the funeral is a very special one, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4418.0s)]
*  because it's about a family of people who have been marginalized, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4421.0s)]
*  people who are homeless, migrants, refugees, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4424.0s)]
*  very much reflecting the causes that mattered to Pope Francis. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4427.0s)]
*  Well as we've mentioned, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4430.0s)]
*  the funeral begins at 10am local time in Rome, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4433.0s)]
*  which is just over half an hour away and will take place [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4436.0s)]
*  outside the St Peter's Basilica. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4439.0s)]
*  The Vatican has released the order of service in advance. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4442.0s)]
*  The Mass is about 27 pages long. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4445.0s)]
*  It has English, Italian or Latin text, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4448.0s)]
*  if you can follow that. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4451.0s)]
*  The Mass usually lasts about two hours and will begin with [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4454.0s)]
*  introductory rites and prayers. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4457.0s)]
*  It's mostly conducted in Latin, as you would expect [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4460.0s)]
*  of a Roman Catholic service. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4463.0s)]
*  There will be readings from Acts of the Apostles and the letter [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4466.0s)]
*  of St Paul to the Philippians. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4469.0s)]
*  The Mass will be held in the [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4472.0s)]
*  liturgy of the Eucharist and Communion. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4479.0s)]
*  It will end with prayers for Pope Francis and a final [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4482.0s)]
*  commendation. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4485.0s)]
*  That's a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4488.0s)]
*  to God. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4491.0s)]
*  You can take a look at that whole order of service if you want to [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4494.0s)]
*  on the BBC News website. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4497.0s)]
*  The BBC's Brazil editor, Caio Queiro, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4500.0s)]
*  is at the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4503.0s)]
*  He joins us from there now. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4506.0s)]
*  Caio, this is an important place because it's where [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4509.0s)]
*  Pope Francis used to pray and where he'll be laid to rest. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4512.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4515.0s)]
*  It was the Pope's favourite church here in Rome. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4518.0s)]
*  He usually came here to pray before and after his [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4521.0s)]
*  international trips. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4524.0s)]
*  He has a special devotion for a special image of the Virgin [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4527.0s)]
*  Mary here, the Salus Populi Romani. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4530.0s)]
*  He used to pray there. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4533.0s)]
*  Tell us what it's like because it's a little way from the [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4536.0s)]
*  Vatican, isn't it? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4539.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4542.0s)]
*  It's a little way from the Vatican. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4545.0s)]
*  It's in a neighbourhood with a large community of migrants, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4548.0s)]
*  especially from Asia. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4551.0s)]
*  It's a very important place. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4554.0s)]
*  It's the most important train station. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4557.0s)]
*  I spoke to some migrants here who live in the region and many [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4560.0s)]
*  talked to me about the beloved memories of seeing the Pope [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4563.0s)]
*  around. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4566.0s)]
*  As luck would have it, it's also very close to the Argentinian [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4569.0s)]
*  embassy, I believe. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4572.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4575.0s)]
*  It's close to the Argentinian embassy and the Pope resonated [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4578.0s)]
*  with Latin America. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4581.0s)]
*  It's the largest Catholic community in the world in Latin [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4584.0s)]
*  America. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4587.0s)]
*  The Pope's sense of humour, the way he smiled and also his [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4590.0s)]
*  concerns about environmental issues and social equality [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4593.0s)]
*  resonated a lot with Latin Americans. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4596.0s)]
*  To what extent did he live up to the hopes and expectations of [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4599.0s)]
*  Latin American Roman Catholics? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4602.0s)]
*  He was such a beloved figure around Latin America, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4605.0s)]
*  around the world, around the world. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4608.0s)]
*  He was a very beloved figure in Argentina as well. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4611.0s)]
*  Of course, some Latin American conservative Catholics [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4614.0s)]
*  criticised some more progressive instance that he defended. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4617.0s)]
*  But he was a very beloved figure there. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4620.0s)]
*  What are their hopes for the next Pope? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4623.0s)]
*  Soon, after the reflections on Pope Francis' legacy, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4626.0s)]
*  thoughts will turn to the conclave where the next [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4629.0s)]
*  Pope will be elected by the Cardinals. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4632.0s)]
*  What are Roman Catholics across Latin America, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4635.0s)]
*  particularly Brazil, hoping for Pope Francis' successor? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4638.0s)]
*  Of course, there is a lot of hope for a new Latin American [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4644.0s)]
*  Pope and a Brazilian Pope as well. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4647.0s)]
*  Many Brazilians are even rooting for some Cardinals. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4650.0s)]
*  There is a Cardinal called Leonardo Steiner who is the Cardinal [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4653.0s)]
*  responsible for the Amazon region. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4656.0s)]
*  Many Brazilians are mentioning his name as hopeful new Pope. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4659.0s)]
*  Tell us what the atmosphere is like around the church [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4662.0s)]
*  where you are at the moment. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4665.0s)]
*  It's probably going to become the focus of a lot of visitors [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4668.0s)]
*  to Rome in the future, isn't it? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4671.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4677.0s)]
*  There are around 100 people already gathering here. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4680.0s)]
*  There are some speakers and also screened people who want to see [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4683.0s)]
*  the Pope in a more calm environment. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4686.0s)]
*  But of course, many people are coming here after the Namaste. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4689.0s)]
*  Caio, for the moment, thank you very much. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4692.0s)]
*  Caio Quera from BBC Brazil at the Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4695.0s)]
*  I was just reading a little bit more about why Pope Francis [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4698.0s)]
*  chose that particular burial site. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4701.0s)]
*  He was a Jesuit, of course, Catholic religious order of priests [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4704.0s)]
*  known for their dedication to education and missionary work. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4707.0s)]
*  He was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4710.0s)]
*  he was a Christian. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4713.0s)]
*  He was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4716.0s)]
*  he chose to be buried in the Santa Maria Maggiore, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4719.0s)]
*  which, as we've said, sits outside the walls of the Vatican [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4722.0s)]
*  in the centre of Rome, a place where he chose to pray [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4725.0s)]
*  quite regularly, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4728.0s)]
*  eschewing the Vatican with its many opportunities to pray [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4731.0s)]
*  and choosing somewhere much, much smaller. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4734.0s)]
*  In his will, which he wrote three years ago, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4737.0s)]
*  he said, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4740.0s)]
*  So that's some of the reason behind his choice [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4743.0s)]
*  of the Santa Maria Maggiore. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4746.0s)]
*  I've been doing my ministry as a priest and bishop. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4749.0s)]
*  I've always entrusted myself to the Mother of our Lord, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4752.0s)]
*  the Blessed Virgin Mary. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4755.0s)]
*  I wish my final earthly journey to end precisely [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4758.0s)]
*  in this ancient Marian sanctuary, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4761.0s)]
*  where I would always stop to pray at the beginning and end [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4764.0s)]
*  of every apostolic journey, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4767.0s)]
*  and I think that's the reason behind his choice [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4770.0s)]
*  of the Santa Maggiore as his final resting place. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4773.0s)]
*  Well, we are not far away, just over half an hour away [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4776.0s)]
*  from the beginning of that funeral service. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4779.0s)]
*  And as we've said, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4782.0s)]
*  it will be a little simpler than we're used to seeing [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4785.0s)]
*  for popes of the past. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4788.0s)]
*  Traditionally, a pope's remains would have been [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4791.0s)]
*  enclosed in a coffin or a casket [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4794.0s)]
*  before the funeral, and there would have been [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4797.0s)]
*  three nested coffins made of [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4800.0s)]
*  cypress, lead and oak. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4803.0s)]
*  And that kind of coffin symbolised humility and mortality, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4806.0s)]
*  the outer oak coffin a sign of dignity and strength, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4809.0s)]
*  and the lead welded to preserve the remains [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4812.0s)]
*  and prevent anyone tampering with them. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4815.0s)]
*  However, Pope Francis did things differently, as we know, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4818.0s)]
*  and he wanted something much, much simpler, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4821.0s)]
*  and he chose a wooden coffin with a zinc interior. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4824.0s)]
*  And that's the coffin that will be seen [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4827.0s)]
*  during that funeral service. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4830.0s)]
*  Of course, as we've said, around [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4833.0s)]
*  200,000 people are expected to pour [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4836.0s)]
*  into St Peter's Square, so they can be [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4839.0s)]
*  close to the service when it takes place. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4842.0s)]
*  And that follows, of course, as the Vatican have said, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4845.0s)]
*  something like a quarter of a million people [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4848.0s)]
*  over the last three days filed past Pope Francis [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4851.0s)]
*  in order to pay their last respects [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4854.0s)]
*  as he lay in state. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4857.0s)]
*  Stay with us for the funeral of Pope Francis [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4860.0s)]
*  here on BBC News. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4863.0s)]

*  and to our coverage today of the funeral of Pope Francis, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4899.0s)]
*  the man who led the Catholic Church for 12 years, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4902.0s)]
*  steering it through a period of change [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4905.0s)]
*  and in some ways modernisation, died on Monday. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4908.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people are now [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4911.0s)]
*  gathering in St Peter's Square and in the surrounding streets [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4914.0s)]
*  to pay their respects. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4917.0s)]
*  Amongst them are heads of state and world leaders [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4920.0s)]
*  who have been arriving over the course of the morning [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4923.0s)]
*  and yesterday evening. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4926.0s)]
*  And of course, millions of others will be watching [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4929.0s)]
*  around the world. The Requiem Mass will begin [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4932.0s)]
*  in about half an hour's time outside St Peter's Basilica [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4935.0s)]
*  here in the Vatican. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4938.0s)]
*  Although Pope Francis set out instructions for a simpler funeral [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4941.0s)]
*  than those of previous popes, today is sure to be [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4944.0s)]
*  a spectacle of ceremony and tradition [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4947.0s)]
*  for the leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4950.0s)]
*  With me this morning to guide us through [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4953.0s)]
*  is our religion editor, Ali Mubool, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4956.0s)]
*  and papal biographer and friend of Pope Francis, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4959.0s)]
*  Austin Ivory. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4962.0s)]
*  We'll be explaining some of the symbolism behind the events today [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4965.0s)]
*  and taking time too to assess the legacy of Pope Francis. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4968.0s)]
*  And we'll be live in St Peter's Square [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4971.0s)]
*  throughout the programme, hearing from those [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4974.0s)]
*  who've made their way here today. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4977.0s)]
*  Austin, you've written [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4980.0s)]
*  two biographies of Pope Francis. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4983.0s)]
*  You worked with him on a third book. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4986.0s)]
*  A lot has been made this week of the mixture [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4989.0s)]
*  that we've seen of tradition, but also the greater simplicity [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4992.0s)]
*  that Pope Francis was known for. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4995.0s)]
*  Are we going to see that this morning? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=4998.0s)]
*  Yes, it's in a way a return to a deeper tradition of the church, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5001.0s)]
*  the early church, which Francis spoke a lot of. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5004.0s)]
*  The master of the ceremonies, Diego Rovelli, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5007.0s)]
*  told the cardinals yesterday that really the changes are all about [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5010.0s)]
*  saying today we are bearing not a man of power [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5013.0s)]
*  but a disciple of Christ, the fisherman, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5016.0s)]
*  as he's traditionally been known. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5019.0s)]
*  So the changes really reflect that, and we've seen that this week. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5022.0s)]
*  For example, the lying in state, lower down, not raised up, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5025.0s)]
*  inside an ordinary coffin, just as if it were any other way. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5028.0s)]
*  And I think really today what we're going to have [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5031.0s)]
*  is actually an ordinary funeral mass, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5034.0s)]
*  but of course on a massive scale. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5037.0s)]
*  And many of the prayers will be specifically for him, for the Pope. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5040.0s)]
*  And I think that we'll see that in the next few days [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5043.0s)]
*  it will look like a mass. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5046.0s)]
*  But of course the readings chosen by him very much reflect him, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5049.0s)]
*  Acts of the Apostles, the story of the early church, Peter, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5052.0s)]
*  St Peter, and he was the successor of St Peter, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5055.0s)]
*  saying I've come to see that God has no favourites. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5058.0s)]
*  This kind of universality which he so embodied, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5061.0s)]
*  which I think we see here in the square [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5064.0s)]
*  with this gathering of representatives of nations. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5067.0s)]
*  Anderleam, not a man of power, says Austin, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5070.0s)]
*  but a disciple of God, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5073.0s)]
*  and yet this is of course no ordinary funeral. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5076.0s)]
*  It's a global event. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5079.0s)]
*  How consequential a moment is this for the church? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5082.0s)]
*  Well, it's a consequential moment for the church, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5085.0s)]
*  but it's a consequential moment in terms of his global role as well. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5088.0s)]
*  In terms of the church, I mean, we're outside at St Peter's Basilica, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5092.0s)]
*  named after the disciple of Jesus, of course, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5096.0s)]
*  and we're talking about his 265th successor [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5099.0s)]
*  that we're saying goodbye to. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5102.0s)]
*  It's going to feel like a momentous moment, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5105.0s)]
*  and just a word about this incredible setting that we have here, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5108.0s)]
*  the arms of the colonnade sort of wrapped around this open-air mass, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5111.0s)]
*  are going to feel extraordinary and spectacular. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5114.0s)]
*  But of course, through the last 12 years, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5117.0s)]
*  yes, it has been a hugely consequential papacy. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5120.0s)]
*  Certainly Pope Francis took the church, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5123.0s)]
*  his 1.4 billion followers, in a different direction. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5126.0s)]
*  He was about reaching out, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5129.0s)]
*  reaching out to the peripheries within the faith, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5132.0s)]
*  but also outside it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5135.0s)]
*  He was about focusing on the people on the margins, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5138.0s)]
*  and he became a global voice for some of those groups, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5141.0s)]
*  some of those people, a connection with suffering. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5144.0s)]
*  And so he is and became a man [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5147.0s)]
*  who broke down a lot of the barriers between the public, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5150.0s)]
*  not just within the Catholic faith, but outside it, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5153.0s)]
*  and this institution and the church and the man himself. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5156.0s)]
*  So it is going to feel, of course, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5159.0s)]
*  like a global event for all of those reasons. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5162.0s)]
*  And I should just explain, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5165.0s)]
*  we can hear helicopters all around us [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5168.0s)]
*  barking out the fact that there are a lot of people, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5171.0s)]
*  heads of government, world leaders, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5174.0s)]
*  so the security is very tight. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5177.0s)]
*  How the Pope was a people's Pope, if you like, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5180.0s)]
*  that's who he was interested in. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5183.0s)]
*  But how has he left the church? What is his legacy there? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5186.0s)]
*  I think he's made many reforms. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5189.0s)]
*  Here in Rome, for example, the culture of the Vatican has been changed. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5192.0s)]
*  I think it's a remarkable achievement, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5195.0s)]
*  because they often say the hardest thing to change is a culture. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5198.0s)]
*  And I would describe that shift as one, if you like, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5201.0s)]
*  a little bit before, a bit bossy and hectoring, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5204.0s)]
*  a little pretentiousness and authoritarianism here in the Vatican. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5207.0s)]
*  I think he has left his mark in terms of simplicity. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5210.0s)]
*  I mean, the cardinals used to joke at the beginning of the pontificate [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5213.0s)]
*  that there's a new humility chic, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5216.0s)]
*  don't wear the big cufflinks, that kind of thing. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5219.0s)]
*  Little touches, but nonetheless they got the message. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5222.0s)]
*  And I think what he's left also is, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5225.0s)]
*  above all, what he would call God's style. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5228.0s)]
*  He showed God's style. What he meant by that was, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5231.0s)]
*  that the way we are called to be with us, we believe as Christians, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5234.0s)]
*  is how we are called to be with other people. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5237.0s)]
*  So a relationship with creation, a relationship with each other, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5240.0s)]
*  particularly the poorest, and a relationship with God, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5243.0s)]
*  that, if you like, reflects how God is with us. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5246.0s)]
*  And he embodied that in how he was. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5249.0s)]
*  Some people say, is this style not substance? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5252.0s)]
*  I would say actually the substance of the transformation is the style, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5255.0s)]
*  which in a way is what we're about as Christians, is a way of being. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5258.0s)]
*  He communicated that in a very infectious and attractive way. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5261.0s)]
*  People were captivated by him. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5264.0s)]
*  And when you asked them, people who knew him, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5267.0s)]
*  what effect he had on them, they would say, as I would say, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5270.0s)]
*  as somebody who was often with him, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5273.0s)]
*  he left you feeling seen, recognised, loved, known. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5276.0s)]
*  So he had this extraordinary authority, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5279.0s)]
*  but he used that authority to raise people up, never to diminish them. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5282.0s)]
*  Aleem, you've been talking to people in the church [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5285.0s)]
*  and people in the streets who are here either by chance or deliberately [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5288.0s)]
*  since the Pope's death. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5291.0s)]
*  And you've also spoken about the void that people feel [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5294.0s)]
*  now that Pope Francis has gone. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5297.0s)]
*  People seem to have a personal connection with him. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5300.0s)]
*  There's no question of that. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5303.0s)]
*  And certainly I spoke to even people inside the Vatican, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5306.0s)]
*  certainly somebody who worked very closely with him, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5309.0s)]
*  who said he didn't quite, until the actual passing of Pope Francis, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5312.0s)]
*  realised how the magnitude of the void would feel. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5315.0s)]
*  And those are people inside because, and I asked why, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5318.0s)]
*  it was because of what he represented [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5321.0s)]
*  and the people he spoke out for in particular. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5324.0s)]
*  And although he wasn't... [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5327.0s)]
*  It wasn't about the great and the good that Pope Francis was about, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5330.0s)]
*  he didn't want to surround himself. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5333.0s)]
*  He always looked rather uncomfortable at the diplomatic events. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5336.0s)]
*  They have to, of course, be a part of the void. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5339.0s)]
*  But he's made sure to include the fact that there are, for example, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5342.0s)]
*  inmates who are going to be part of the congregation down there, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5345.0s)]
*  torture victims, migrants, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5348.0s)]
*  are going to be part of the congregation down there. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5351.0s)]
*  He is going to leave here and the streets are lined with people. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5354.0s)]
*  So he's going to leave the dignitaries. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5357.0s)]
*  They are not going to get the same. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5360.0s)]
*  The final goodbye is the people lining the streets. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5363.0s)]
*  That was a lot of what he was about. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5366.0s)]
*  And where he's going to be buried, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5369.0s)]
*  unusually he's not going to be buried here in the crypt [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5372.0s)]
*  of the Basilica, St Peter's Basilica, where he's going to, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5375.0s)]
*  the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5378.0s)]
*  he'll be greeted by a group of homeless people, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5381.0s)]
*  including non-Catholics. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5384.0s)]
*  There'll be Muslims in that group as well. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5387.0s)]
*  He was about reaching out. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5390.0s)]
*  People feel connected to him in a way because of who he spoke out to, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5393.0s)]
*  and he's reached out to here and around the world. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5396.0s)]
*  Alim, Austin, thank you both very much for the moment. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5399.0s)]
*  Don't go very far. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5402.0s)]
*  We'll be coming back to you very shortly. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5405.0s)]
*  I just want to tell you more about the funeral of Pope Francis, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5408.0s)]
*  which will be simpler than those of previous popes, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5411.0s)]
*  following instructions that he set out himself. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5414.0s)]
*  But as a head of state and leader of more than a billion Catholics [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5417.0s)]
*  worldwide, it will still be a spectacle of ceremony and tradition. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5420.0s)]
*  But before we do that, how will today unfold? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5423.0s)]
*  Pope Francis has been lying in state since Wednesday, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5426.0s)]
*  inside St Peter's Basilica in the heart of the Vatican, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5429.0s)]
*  where tens of thousands of people have queued to say goodbye [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5432.0s)]
*  before the funeral. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5435.0s)]
*  The Mass is going to take place at 9am UK time, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5438.0s)]
*  that's 10am here in Rome, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5441.0s)]
*  in front of St Peter's Basilica. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5444.0s)]
*  At least 170 heads of state or government will be attending, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5447.0s)]
*  according to the Rome mayor's office. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5450.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of mourners are also expected to gather [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5453.0s)]
*  in St Peter's Square and in the surroundings. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5456.0s)]
*  After a concluding prayer formally entrusting the Pope to God, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5459.0s)]
*  a procession will take place to move the pontiff [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5462.0s)]
*  to be buried in St Mary Major Basilica, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5465.0s)]
*  which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5468.0s)]
*  The burial will take place in the evening. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5471.0s)]
*  Pope Francis asked that his tomb would be in the ground, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5474.0s)]
*  simple and bearing only the inscription, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5477.0s)]
*  Francis, the Latin version of his chosen name. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5480.0s)]
*  In the weeks that follow, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5483.0s)]
*  the process of selecting a new pope, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5486.0s)]
*  known as the Conclave, will then take place. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5489.0s)]
*  Cardinals are cut off from the outside world [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5492.0s)]
*  to vote in a secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5495.0s)]
*  A new pope is elected when a candidate has secured [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5498.0s)]
*  the support of 90 cardinals, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5501.0s)]
*  which can take several rounds of voting over days, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5504.0s)]
*  weeks or even months. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5507.0s)]
*  My colleague Marion Moshiri is in St Peter's Square for us now. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5510.0s)]
*  Marion. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5513.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5516.0s)]
*  This is a hugely important day for the church, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5519.0s)]
*  but it is also a poignant day for the 1.4 billion Catholics [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5522.0s)]
*  around the world. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5525.0s)]
*  We are estimating that around 200,000 of them will be here [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5528.0s)]
*  at St Peter's Square to pay their final respects to the pope. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5531.0s)]
*  I have met people from all over the world, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5534.0s)]
*  from Chile, Argentina, Switzerland, France. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5537.0s)]
*  There are so many here, and there are many young people as well. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5540.0s)]
*  These few days from today moving on through the weekend [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5543.0s)]
*  were supposed to be part of the annual Jubilee celebration [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5546.0s)]
*  that is such a holy year. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5549.0s)]
*  It happens every 25 years. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5552.0s)]
*  The Catholic youth were supposed to have a celebration here this weekend. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5555.0s)]
*  Earlier we saw priests, nuns, groups of pilgrims running [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5558.0s)]
*  to get a better view of the funeral when it begins very shortly. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5561.0s)]
*  I am joined here by a number of those people who have come here. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5564.0s)]
*  Here we have Claire, Erin and Maria. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5567.0s)]
*  You guys have come from Kirky in Glasgow just for the funeral. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5570.0s)]
*  Tell me why. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5573.0s)]
*  We were able to come here. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5576.0s)]
*  We wanted to come here, although it is a sad day for the Catholic church. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5579.0s)]
*  We have been here for a long time. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5582.0s)]
*  We wanted to celebrate a great leader. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5585.0s)]
*  We wanted to be part of it. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5588.0s)]
*  It is the same. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5591.0s)]
*  Claire is on maternity leave. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5594.0s)]
*  Erin managed to get time off work. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5597.0s)]
*  We were like, why not just go and celebrate? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5600.0s)]
*  It is a great experience. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5603.0s)]
*  Although it is sad, it is great to celebrate how great a hope it was. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5606.0s)]
*  It is such an amazing atmosphere here. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5609.0s)]
*  What did Pope Francis mean to you? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5612.0s)]
*  As a young person, he spoke to the youth. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5615.0s)]
*  We went to World Youth Day in Lisbon in 2023. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5618.0s)]
*  Thousands of people gathered today. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5621.0s)]
*  That speaks volumes. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5624.0s)]
*  I would agree. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5627.0s)]
*  I am a bit older than them. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5630.0s)]
*  This is the third port now. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5633.0s)]
*  I was lucky enough to be in Bellhusom when Benedict came to Glasgow. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5636.0s)]
*  I am happy to be here. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5639.0s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5642.0s)]
*  I will let you get ahead. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5645.0s)]
*  A lot of people are trying to get ahead. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5648.0s)]
*  I am joined by Kathleen. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5651.0s)]
*  You are originally from Philadelphia. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5654.0s)]
*  You came here from Cairo. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5657.0s)]
*  I was inspired to come after the death of Pope Francis. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5660.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5663.0s)]
*  He was a man who reminded us all that we needed to be compassionate. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5666.0s)]
*  To each other, stay in community. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5669.0s)]
*  A person you could look up to who was not cruel. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5672.0s)]
*  Who was not competitive. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5675.0s)]
*  He stayed humble. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5678.0s)]
*  He kept the message of Jesus and Saint Francis. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5681.0s)]
*  He kept the message of Jesus and Saint Francis. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5684.0s)]
*  He kept the message of Jesus and Saint Francis. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5687.0s)]
*  He was a man who reminded us all that we needed to be compassionate to each other. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5690.0s)]
*  I was inspired to come after the death of Pope Francis. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5693.0s)]
*  He kept the message of Jesus and Saint Francis. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5696.0s)]
*  Looking ahead, what do you want from the Catholic Church? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5699.0s)]
*  What do you want from the next Pope? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5702.0s)]
*  To remember the basic tenets of our faith. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5705.0s)]
*  To love each other as we love ourselves. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5708.0s)]
*  Love God before all. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5711.0s)]
*  Thank you for talking to me. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5714.0s)]
*  That is no problem. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5717.0s)]
*  The feeling I get from people here is that, yes, they are sad, they are [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5720.0s)]
*  mourning Pope Francis, but there is a great deal of gratitude, there is a [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5725.04s)]
*  feeling of celebration almost of his life rather than the mourning of [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5729.24s)]
*  his death. The crowds continue to move forward as the funeral is due to [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5734.24s)]
*  begin very shortly. Back to you, Rita. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5739.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. We are seeing the arrival of world leaders coming [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5743.76s)]
*  into St Peter's Square. We saw the leader of Argentina, Javier [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5752.0s)]
*  Milais, not very long ago, and Pope Francis was, of course, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5756.280000000001s)]
*  Argentinian. Austin Ivory and Aline McBull are both still with me. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5762.4800000000005s)]
*  Austin, it is worth talking about the way in which people are sitting [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5768.360000000001s)]
*  at St Peter's Square, because they are grouped, aren't they? To the right [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5772.28s)]
*  of the altar you have the heads of state, further down the national [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5776.08s)]
*  delegations, the people again still further down on the right. The sea [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5779.96s)]
*  of whites you see there on the left, they are all vested for the mass [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5784.16s)]
*  because they are what are called con celebrants. There are hundreds and [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5788.2s)]
*  hundreds of them. I can tell you there are 220 cardinals and 750 [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5791.4s)]
*  bishops at least who are con celebrating and then loads and loads [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5796.48s)]
*  of others. Up at the altar we will see the cardinal Dean who is [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5799.84s)]
*  presiding, Cardinal Reign, 91-year-old veteran cardinal who Francis [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5804.52s)]
*  reappointed only last year in this very, very important role and then [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5809.12s)]
*  two other cardinals also con celebrating with him at the altar who [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5813.12s)]
*  are the senior deacon bishops, one of whom is Cardinal Parolin, the [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5816.4800000000005s)]
*  secretary of state. What they have tried to do is have in the square [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5820.24s)]
*  representatives, Aline was talking about, members of the homeless, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5824.56s)]
*  refugees and so on, they have tried to represent the people of God [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5828.32s)]
*  here in the square. It is very atmospheric here now, we can hear the [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5831.96s)]
*  bells of course and lots of people starting to gather. You can see more [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5837.36s)]
*  dignitaries coming in. Aline, I think you mentioned a little earlier, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5842.88s)]
*  interestingly, these are not all necessarily people that Pope Francis [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5847.28s)]
*  would have got on with, agreed with? Because Pope Francis was very vocal [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5852.28s)]
*  when it came to the environment, very vocal when it came to the [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5856.88s)]
*  dignity of migrants, for example, when it came to poverty and the [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5861.84s)]
*  homeless and how some of these powerful people treated them. He was [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5865.72s)]
*  very vocal about all of those things and that is why he was at loggerheads [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5869.76s)]
*  with some of the very characters who are going to be attending his funeral [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5873.72s)]
*  today. But some of those who opposed his work were not just heads of [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5877.32s)]
*  state, politicians, sometimes there were some of those within the [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5882.12s)]
*  church itself, some of the cardinals. While Pope Francis was seen as a [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5885.84s)]
*  bit of a rock star globally because of some of the issues he championed, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5890.52s)]
*  actually some of his most vocal critics were within the church, some [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5894.08s)]
*  very traditionalist cardinals, for example, who felt he was going too [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5898.16s)]
*  far in his outreach, for example, to other faiths, to moving the church [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5902.52s)]
*  away from being clerical led, led by its hierarchy and leadership and [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5907.68s)]
*  more into the hands of the people. They will have to sit through this as [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5912.639999999999s)]
*  well, but as you rightly say, alongside some of those characters who [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5916.04s)]
*  represent the causes that he felt very close to. I think it is worth [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5921.28s)]
*  pointing out as well, isn't it, that the Vatican issues an open [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5926.28s)]
*  invitation to all world leaders. They don't discriminate, anyone can come. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5929.44s)]
*  Quite right. But I think Pope Francis, who was keenly aware, he thought [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5935.16s)]
*  he's written in his autobiography, that he only felt he was going to be [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5941.0s)]
*  Pope not for 12 years but three or four years. He was in a rush to get [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5945.68s)]
*  work done, but he was very conscious of his mortality. He'd thought through [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5949.8s)]
*  this moment a lot over the years. And so while he recognised that that [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5953.72s)]
*  would be the case, that these leaders would be here, he has made sure [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5957.92s)]
*  there's a sprinkling of his own character through this, the fact that [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5961.400000000001s)]
*  he will then leave these people behind and who will greet him at the very [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5964.92s)]
*  end, who get the greatest honour, are actually not these dignitaries. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5968.28s)]
*  We're seeing there the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, and his [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5972.96s)]
*  wife Brigitte, who are paying their respects at the coffin. And we're [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5978.32s)]
*  going to be seeing this in the next few minutes, just before the funeral [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5986.96s)]
*  starts, more world leaders standing in front of the coffin. And there, as [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=5991.64s)]
*  you can see, Prince William paying his respects. A very solemn moment, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6000.12s)]
*  this. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6007.200000000001s)]
*  As the bells are ringing, Austin, the square has become much quieter. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6022.64s)]
*  It's a very serene atmosphere, remarkably. These moments are usually [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6029.4400000000005s)]
*  people get the message that they are here to meditate, to recollect in [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6035.72s)]
*  their own hearts and minds the gift that he's been to us. But it is [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6040.400000000001s)]
*  fascinating to see how the atmosphere sort of spreads and people who are [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6043.84s)]
*  not used to being sitting in silence, they do it on these occasions. And [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6046.6s)]
*  I'm thinking of some particularly garrulous world leaders for whom it [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6051.0s)]
*  would be unusual to be sitting in silence like this. Just to go back to [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6054.64s)]
*  your point about the open invitation, famously back in 2005 at the funeral [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6058.56s)]
*  of John Paul II, Prince Charles, the then Prince Charles, was standing [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6063.32s)]
*  next to the dictator Robert Mugabe. And there's a moment in the mass, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6067.72s)]
*  which is called the sign of the peace, which is traditionally done by a [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6071.76s)]
*  handshake and Mugabe turned to Prince Charles. It was a big media. But I [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6075.16s)]
*  don't think it's a sign. Why was Mugabe invited? Because he was head of [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6079.28s)]
*  state. Anybody can come. It's a remarkable moment. Yes, indeed. A few [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6082.5599999999995s)]
*  moments ago, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, also [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6087.639999999999s)]
*  paid his respects. With his wife, Melania. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6095.44s)]
*  It is an extraordinary spectacle, isn't it, to see so many world leaders, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6109.28s)]
*  so many people here in one place saying their farewells. Aline? You're [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6119.44s)]
*  talking about the quiet, but remember, we may have around a quarter of a [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6127.679999999999s)]
*  million people around us in these streets. And an awful lot of young [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6131.92s)]
*  people. You'll know that actually this week was going to be a weekend for [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6135.36s)]
*  young people in the Catholic Church in the Jubilee. So there are lots of [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6141.16s)]
*  groups already coming out here. But there was a way in which this [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6144.599999999999s)]
*  octogenarian connected with young people. And that was a lot to do with [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6149.4s)]
*  the causes. He was vehemently anti-war. He talked of war being in itself a [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6153.96s)]
*  failure. He was very passionate about climate change. And because of those [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6159.4s)]
*  causes, he did connect with a lot of young people within the faith and [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6164.28s)]
*  outside. And it has been striking walking the streets as I came through [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6168.96s)]
*  just how many young people there are among the mourners. There has been [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6173.5199999999995s)]
*  some commentary, hasn't there, that Catholicism is on the rise among [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6178.12s)]
*  younger people, that there has been a growth in interest in the religion, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6183.36s)]
*  in the church during this papacy? Yes. I mean, part of what Pope Francis did [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6188.16s)]
*  was reorientate the church so it wasn't so much about the clerical, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6194.16s)]
*  reorientate it to look more towards the marginalised, but also [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6198.0s)]
*  reorientate it to where the faith is growing, is energised. And that's not [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6201.72s)]
*  in Europe. There have been, as you say, there has been a little bit of an [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6207.04s)]
*  uptick here and there as people are more connected globally. But where [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6211.8s)]
*  we're seeing the energy and the faith, if you like, is in South America, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6215.92s)]
*  is in Asia, places like the Philippines. And he was very focused on trying [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6220.32s)]
*  to reflect that here in Rome. In the cardinals, for example, that he [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6225.64s)]
*  appointed over the last 12 years, it is the most diverse group of cardinals [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6229.88s)]
*  there has ever been. For the first time in history, when we're talking [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6235.16s)]
*  about the cardinals who are going to select the successor for Pope Francis, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6239.32s)]
*  for the first time in history, fewer than 50% of them are going to be [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6243.0s)]
*  European. And so he was very clear that this was not about Rome, it wasn't [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6246.52s)]
*  about the Vatican, it wasn't about the hierarchy, it was about the places [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6254.120000000001s)]
*  where the faith was being energised. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6259.280000000001s)]
*  Just to reinforce that, this is no longer a European church with an [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6262.080000000001s)]
*  outreach, it's what we call a multipolar church. There are many centres [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6266.56s)]
*  of Catholicism, Asia, Latin America and so on. So, Francis in many ways [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6269.92s)]
*  was preparing the church for that. But just on the West and this phenomenon, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6274.92s)]
*  there's been a very sharp decline in what we might call the cultural [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6278.52s)]
*  Catholics, people who inherited their faith through family and tradition [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6281.52s)]
*  and identity. But there has been a really remarkable rise, particularly [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6285.0s)]
*  in the last few years, and European cathedrals are reporting quite a [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6288.4800000000005s)]
*  sharp uptick in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are coming from a [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6292.8s)]
*  non-faith background. Now, these are the people sometimes called the [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6296.360000000001s)]
*  seekers and searchers. What this means, Francis was able to understand [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6299.360000000001s)]
*  what we're entering into, is what he called a change of era. It's a very [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6304.2s)]
*  different kind of a society where the church is no longer, as it were, a [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6307.88s)]
*  dominant institution pronouncing from above, but gives witness from below [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6311.68s)]
*  in a much more humble way. And he was able to help the church to change [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6316.24s)]
*  because he himself was from a continent where, of course, the resources [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6321.96s)]
*  are much lower, where you have many fewer priests per people. So, in many [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6325.32s)]
*  ways, he's been gently, patiently assisting the church to make this [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6329.72s)]
*  shift towards a new era, both in the West, but also a church that, as [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6333.2s)]
*  Aline was saying, much more reflects the global reality that the church [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6338.72s)]
*  is young and booming in the places where it's poorest. So interesting. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6343.04s)]
*  Well, as you've just come to the end there, Austin, we see the Prime [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6348.8s)]
*  Minister, Sikhiya Starmer, who's been in two St Peter's Basilica to pay [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6353.96s)]
*  his respects, just emerging into the sunshine. And more foreign leaders [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6362.56s)]
*  and dignitaries are catching Sikhiya again with his wife, Victoria. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6373.280000000001s)]
*  And they're going to go to the area that Austin pointed out a little [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6379.6s)]
*  earlier, where the foreign leaders are seated. We've spoken so much, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6384.96s)]
*  haven't we, about Pope Francis' humility, his modesty, his simplicity. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6392.16s)]
*  And yet what we're seeing is something grand ornate. It's a spectacle. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6398.48s)]
*  It's a real spectacle. All of those things. And there is, of course, a [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6405.5199999999995s)]
*  great deal of ritual that's involved. We'll very soon see the coffin of [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6410.639999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis brought out. Previous popes have had three coffins, one [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6415.84s)]
*  inside the other. He has opted for the simple single coffin. Inside it, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6421.16s)]
*  though, now it's been sealed, inside it is also his miter, his papal hat, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6427.639999999999s)]
*  his staff, his pastoral staff. And there will also be in there a scroll [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6432.76s)]
*  on which is written a record of his life, of his papacy. That's also [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6438.24s)]
*  sealed in there as well. So this tradition is obviously still all [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6444.36s)]
*  there, as much as he wanted to simplify it, as much as he wanted to [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6447.96s)]
*  put some of this in the hands of the people with whom he has such an [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6451.4s)]
*  affinity. But yes, an extraordinary stage and an extraordinary spectacle [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6457.56s)]
*  all the same. I think some people sometimes have been uncomfortable [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6462.16s)]
*  with what they see as Francis' rejection of tradition. I wouldn't [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6465.68s)]
*  agree with that. He was actually a man of tradition, a very traditional [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6468.92s)]
*  Catholic. But he understood that, first of all, tradition was something [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6472.56s)]
*  living, it needed to develop, and it develops in a sense by going back [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6475.36s)]
*  and recovering the things that it has lost. And one of the things that, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6479.5199999999995s)]
*  in a way, the church lost in its great long association with monarchy [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6482.96s)]
*  and power was a certain kind of trappings, which the church has been [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6486.639999999999s)]
*  gradually getting rid of. I mean, just the examples you've given, yes, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6490.92s)]
*  he was buried with his miter. Normally, apparently, they have a new [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6494.0s)]
*  miter, which must cost hundreds of pounds. He said, don't be ridiculous, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6498.24s)]
*  just put my old miter in there. What's the point of having a new miter [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6502.04s)]
*  inside a coffin? Common sense changes. He hated wasting money, by the way, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6504.68s)]
*  in his testament saying, I want to be buried in St Mary Major. And by the [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6509.64s)]
*  way, here's a benefactor who's covered the costs, not to add to the [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6513.76s)]
*  burdens of anybody. And I remember, as we all do, when he was first [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6517.92s)]
*  elected, the first thing he did, he went back to his guesthouse where he [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6522.56s)]
*  was staying and paid the bill personally. Little signs to say, we're [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6526.16s)]
*  not here to take advantage of the church, but to serve the church. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6530.72s)]
*  That was very, very much him in death as in life. These are such [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6534.64s)]
*  interesting insights. The Mass is about to start, Austin, in a couple of [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6538.8s)]
*  minutes. Just briefly explain to us the form it's going to take. Sure. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6544.280000000001s)]
*  Catholics will instantly recognise this as a funeral Mass, a requiem [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6548.96s)]
*  Mass, meaning it is a Mass with prayers and readings. Then moving into [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6553.8s)]
*  the second half, which is called the Liturgy of the Eucharist, where the [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6558.8s)]
*  sacraments are celebrated, where the bread and wine are consecrated, and [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6562.8s)]
*  then the funeral rites, the commendation at the end. There will be [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6566.96s)]
*  an extra element which most people will not have seen before in a [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6570.88s)]
*  funeral, which is the Eastern churches, who are in communion with [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6574.64s)]
*  Rome, but they have a very different liturgical tradition, will have their [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6579.64s)]
*  own separate rite at the end where they will bless the coffin and say [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6582.52s)]
*  their own prayers. A reminder, by the way, we often confuse the Catholic [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6586.320000000001s)]
*  church with the Latin church, but the Catholic church is bigger even than [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6591.0s)]
*  the Latin Catholic tradition. We have the Eastern traditions. So the [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6594.64s)]
*  full kind of Catholicity, as we like to say, the universality of the [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6599.6s)]
*  church is very much represented in what we're going to see today, not [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6603.08s)]
*  least in the huge variety of languages that you will hear, the [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6607.08s)]
*  readings being said in different languages, the intercessions, lots of [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6610.28s)]
*  different languages, again, reflecting the universality of the church. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6613.8s)]
*  Once the mass comes to an end, Aline, we are going to have something [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6618.96s)]
*  unprecedented, aren't we? Yes, as we say. It is usually a 20-minute [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6622.360000000001s)]
*  journey across town to the centre of Rome, to what many Romans feel is [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6627.96s)]
*  the real sort of church of the city, the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6632.56s)]
*  which is where he is going to be buried. Usually a 20-minute drive. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6638.280000000001s)]
*  Instead, it is likely to take around an hour as the procession goes [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6641.400000000001s)]
*  through the city and people will get a chance to follow behind, get a [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6648.04s)]
*  chance to pay their respects for a final time. And that is not [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6652.4800000000005s)]
*  something we have seen in the past. Of course, this is a city that knows [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6658.16s)]
*  how to say goodbye to leaders, to emperors, to popes. It does it well. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6661.84s)]
*  But there are elements still that will be new today. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6666.92s)]
*  More very familiar faces. We can see now Donald Trump emerging from [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6670.44s)]
*  St Peter's Basilica. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6678.759999999999s)]
*  A change from the usual hurly-burly of his political life, with his wife [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6688.16s)]
*  Milania, of course. This is a moment where politics are apparently all [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6695.4s)]
*  put to one side and people are here to mourn the Pope and to reflect [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6700.599999999999s)]
*  together. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6706.679999999999s)]
*  And can you hear the applause as we see President Zelensky of Ukraine? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6726.4s)]
*  That appears to be a very spontaneous burst of applause for the leader of [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6743.16s)]
*  a country which is at war. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6748.04s)]
*  What else are we likely to be seeing in the last minutes? You are just [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6756.4s)]
*  mentioning Zelensky. Of course, Francis had endless talks and meetings [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6761.0s)]
*  with Zelensky. He cared enormously about ending the war, the Russian-Ukraine [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6764.679999999999s)]
*  war. It deeply saddened him that the world never got it together, that [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6769.799999999999s)]
*  the United Nations failed to prevent both that war and the Gaza war. But I [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6774.48s)]
*  was just thinking earlier, talking about the diversity of who is here, I [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6778.879999999999s)]
*  remember an indigenous headdress earlier. And a reminder that in [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6783.0s)]
*  October in the square, Francis processed with the indigenous people of [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6787.0s)]
*  the Amazon to do this remarkable meeting on how the church could assist [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6792.0s)]
*  the Amazon people and the ecological case for Amazonia. And I remember [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6796.0s)]
*  him being at the centre of indigenous people carrying canoes and paddles. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6801.0s)]
*  He had this special love for native peoples and he often said that they [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6807.0s)]
*  had a special love for their own self-living and a connection with [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6812.0s)]
*  creation from which we in the West need desperately to learn. That [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6816.0s)]
*  affinity he had with them, it is just lovely to see that headdress again [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6820.0s)]
*  in the square. I have to say the arrival of President Zelensky is a [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6824.0s)]
*  reminder that not everyone thought Pope Francis got it right on the [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6828.0s)]
*  global stage. There were those who felt he could have spoken out more [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6832.0s)]
*  openly on the side of Ukrainian Catholics, for example, to call out [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6837.0s)]
*  the aggressor in that particular case. He apparently, according to [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6843.0s)]
*  advisers, saw his role as being a peacemaker, finding a way to bring [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6848.0s)]
*  sides together. But some were critical of him by saying that meant in a [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6852.0s)]
*  sense he was appeasing Russia and its aggression. On other occasions he [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6857.0s)]
*  spoke very vocally against war. We know that he was contacting a church in [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6862.0s)]
*  the West, even through his illness. He was very clear there. He called [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6866.0s)]
*  the war in Gaza terrorism. There are occasions where he has been very [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6871.0s)]
*  clear about the way he feels. There are times where there was some [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6875.0s)]
*  criticism that he was not more vocal, he was not more unequivocal about [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6880.0s)]
*  who was in the wrong, but he always was trying to be a pragmatist. The [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6887.0s)]
*  people who were in the wrong were surprised by who he said he would [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6892.0s)]
*  agree to meet. He was very strong-willed, a gentle man, a polite [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6895.0s)]
*  man, but very strong-willed. When he decided he was going to do something, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6899.0s)]
*  even if his adviser said he shouldn't, he said, if you don't want to go [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6903.0s)]
*  with me to Iraq or go with me to the Central African Republic, I'm going [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6907.0s)]
*  to go anyway. He had an obstinate streak, I think, he said, that [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6911.0s)]
*  was his response. We are seeing world leaders milling about, exchanging [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6916.0s)]
*  what looks like a good-natured word. We don't know what is being said. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6923.0s)]
*  There are many ecumenical delegates here present today. The list is [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6929.0s)]
*  vast, it goes on for pages and pages. Every imaginable church, but quite [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6935.0s)]
*  the Russian metropolitan represented. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6941.0s)]
*  Austin, we are now seeing the coffin being borne out by what looks like [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6946.0s)]
*  10, 12 bearers slowly out of the Basilica of St Peter's. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6955.0s)]
*  And it's going to be laying in the square. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6964.0s)]
*  The coffin just bears a cross and his own papal coat of arms with the words [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6975.0s)]
*  And looking with mercy he chose him, which was always the motto he had chosen, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6986.0s)]
*  which comes from Matthew, how Jesus chose Matthew. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6993.0s)]
*  He looked at him with mercy and the Apostle was chosen. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=6997.0s)]
*  He always identified with the Apostle Matthew. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7001.0s)]
*  I'm an unworthy person who has been called, looked on with mercy and called to this mission. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7004.0s)]
*  So it's beautiful that it's there on his coffin. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7010.0s)]
*  So there among the crowd you see the ones dressed in white with the red stoles. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7015.0s)]
*  The red of course is the colour of the papal funeral. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7037.0s)]
*  They are the con celebrants. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7040.0s)]
*  They will all be priests or bishops celebrating the mass taking part in that [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7042.0s)]
*  consecration of the Eucharist in the second part of the liturgy. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7047.0s)]
*  The cardinals you see there, there are 220 I believe, 135 will be under 80. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7052.0s)]
*  They will be the ones who will be electing Francis' successor. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7059.0s)]
*  The others are the over 80s, the Amedity as they're known, who are all invited. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7063.0s)]
*  Not all of them can come because some of them are ill or infirm, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7068.0s)]
*  but as many as possible are here lining there as the coffin is brought forward. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=7072.0s)]

*  In [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=8951.1s)]
*  this majestic St. Peter's Square, the Pope Francis celebrated the Eucharist so many times [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=8977.98s)]
*  and presided over great gatherings over the past 12 years. We are gathered with sad hearts [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=8990.939999999999s)]
*  in prayer around his mortal remains. Yet we are sustained by the certainty of faith [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9005.34s)]
*  which assures us that human existence does not end in the tomb but in the Father's house, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9014.14s)]
*  in a life of happiness that will know no end. On behalf of the College of Cardinals, [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9021.34s)]
*  I cordially thank you. I thank all of you for your presence. With deep emotion, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9030.78s)]
*  I extend respectful greetings and heartfelt thanks to the heads of state, heads of government, [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9042.140000000001s)]
*  and official delegations who have come in great numbers from many countries to express their [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9051.66s)]
*  affection, veneration, and esteem for our late Holy Father. The outpouring of affection that we [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9059.5s)]
*  have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this earth into eternity tells us [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9068.38s)]
*  how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9079.259999999998s)]
*  The final image we have of him which will remain etched in our memory, in our eyes, in our hearts, [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9090.699999999999s)]
*  is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday, when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9100.78s)]
*  wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9109.980000000001s)]
*  He then came down to this square to greet from his open Pope mobile [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9119.820000000002s)]
*  the large crowd gathered for the Easter mass. With our prayers, we now entrust [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9130.22s)]
*  the soul of our beloved Pontiff to God that he may grant him eternal happiness [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9141.02s)]
*  in the bright and glorious gaze of his immense love. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9149.42s)]
*  We are enlightened and guided by the passage of the gospel in which the very voice of Christ [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9158.22s)]
*  resounded, asking the first of the apostles, Peter, Peter, do you love me more than these? [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9165.98s)]
*  Peter's answer was prompt and sincere, Lord, you know everything, you know that I love you. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9179.82s)]
*  Jesus then entrusted him with the great mission, feed my sheep. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9193.74s)]
*  This will be the constant task of Peter and his successors, a service of love in the footsteps [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9200.94s)]
*  of Christ, our master and Lord. Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9212.78s)]
*  Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9223.9s)]
*  He followed in the footsteps of his Lord, the Good Shepherd, who loved his sheep [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9232.3s)]
*  to the point of giving his life for them. And he did so with strength and serenity. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9240.619999999999s)]
*  Close to his flock, the Church of God. When Cardinal Bergoglio was elected by the conclave [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9250.06s)]
*  on the 13th of March 2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, he already had many years of experience in [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9263.18s)]
*  religious life in the Society of Jesus, and above all was enriched by 21 years of pastoral ministry [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9272.46s)]
*  in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, first as auxiliary, then as co-adjutor, and above all as [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9282.699999999999s)]
*  archbishop. The decision to take the name Francis immediately appeared to indicate [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9291.9s)]
*  the pastoral plan and style on which he wanted to base his pontificate, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9311.34s)]
*  seeking inspiration from the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9318.38s)]
*  He maintained this temperament and form of pastoral leadership, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9326.14s)]
*  and through his resolute personality immediately made his mark on the governance of the Church. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9334.539999999999s)]
*  He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9342.22s)]
*  eager to be close to everyone with a marked attention to those in difficulty, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9351.42s)]
*  giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalized, the least among us. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9361.82s)]
*  He was a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9368.859999999999s)]
*  He was also a pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9379.98s)]
*  the Church. With his characteristic vocabulary and language rich in images and metaphors, [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9391.18s)]
*  he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time with the wisdom of the Gospel. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9404.300000000001s)]
*  He did so by offering a response guided by the light of faith and encouraging us to live as [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9414.779999999999s)]
*  Christians amid the challenges and contradictions in recent years, which he loved to describe [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9425.18s)]
*  as an epochal change. He had great spontaneity and an informal way of addressing everyone, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9432.86s)]
*  even those far from the Church, rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9442.699999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9457.02s)]
*  He gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people's [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9465.66s)]
*  hearts in a direct and immediate way. His charisma of welcome and listening, combined with a manner [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9474.94s)]
*  of behaviour in keeping with today's sensitivities touched hearts and sought [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9488.06s)]
*  to reawaken moral and spiritual sensibilities. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9498.38s)]
*  Evangelisation was the guiding principle of his pontificate. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9508.46s)]
*  With a clear missionary vision, he spread the joy of the Gospel, [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9512.38s)]
*  which was the title of his first apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium. It is a joy [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9521.58s)]
*  that fills the hearts of all those who entrust themselves to God with confidence and hope. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9529.5s)]
*  The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the Church is a home for all, [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9536.62s)]
*  a home with its doors always open. He often used the image of the Church as a field hospital [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9547.900000000001s)]
*  after a battle in which many were wounded. The Church determined to take care of the problems [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9561.98s)]
*  of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart. The Church capable of [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9579.02s)]
*  bending down to every person regardless of their beliefs or condition and healing their wounds. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9591.66s)]
*  His gestures and exhortations in favour of refugees and displaced persons are countless. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9602.94s)]
*  His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant. It is significant that [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9610.86s)]
*  Pope Francis' first journey was to the island of Lampedusa, an island that symbolises the [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9621.02s)]
*  tragedy of emigration with thousands of people drowning at sea. In the same vein was his trip [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9631.82s)]
*  to Lesbos together with the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Archbishop of Athens, as well as the [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9643.34s)]
*  celebration of a mass on the border between Mexico and the United States during his journey to Mexico. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9652.62s)]
*  Of his 47 arduous apostolic journeys, the one to Iraq in 2021 will remain particularly memorable, [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9660.94s)]
*  defying every risk present at the time. That difficult apostolic journey was a balm on the [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9683.18s)]
*  open wounds of the Iraqi people who had suffered so much from the inhuman actions of ISIS. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9692.300000000001s)]
*  It was also an important trip for inter-religious dialogue, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9703.339999999998s)]
*  another significant dimension of his pastoral work. With his 2024 apostolic journey to four [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9711.5s)]
*  countries in Asia and Oceania, the Pope reached the most peripheral periphery in the world. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9725.42s)]
*  Pope Francis always placed the Gospel of Mercy at the centre, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9741.02s)]
*  repeatedly emphasising that God never tires of forgiving us. He always forgives [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9747.74s)]
*  whatever the situation might be of the person who asks for forgiveness and returns to the right path. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9756.86s)]
*  He called for the extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in order to highlight that Mercy is the heart of [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9764.54s)]
*  the Gospel. Mercy and the joy of the Gospel are two key words for Pope Francis. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9775.02s)]
*  In contrast to what he called throwaway culture, he spoke of the culture of encounter, the culture [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9788.300000000001s)]
*  of solidarity. Then there is the theme of fraternity which ran through his entire pontificate [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9802.54s)]
*  with vibrant tones. In his encyclical letter Fratelli tutti, he wanted to revive a worldwide [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9816.380000000001s)]
*  aspiration to fraternity because we are all children of the same Father who is in heaven. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9827.82s)]
*  He often vehemently reminded us that we all belong to the same human family [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9839.18s)]
*  and nobody can be saved alone. In 2019, during his trip to the United Arab Emirates, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9848.22s)]
*  Pope Francis signed a document on human fraternity for world peace and living together, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9863.82s)]
*  recalling the common fatherhood of God. Addressing men and women throughout the world, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9874.38s)]
*  in his encyclical letter Laudato Si, he drew attention to our duties and shared responsibility [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9887.34s)]
*  for our common home. Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9899.259999999998s)]
*  and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice imploring peace [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9915.98s)]
*  and calling for reason and calling for honest negotiation to find possible solutions. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9928.3s)]
*  War, he said, results in the destruction of the world. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9938.380000000001s)]
*  Honest negotiation to find possible solutions. War, he said, results in the death of people [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9947.58s)]
*  and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always, this is his own expression, [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9961.82s)]
*  war always leaves the world worse than it was before. It is always a painful [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9973.1s)]
*  and tragic defeat for everyone. Build bridges, not walls, was an exhortation he repeated many times [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=9983.900000000001s)]
*  and his service of faith as successor of the apostle Peter [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=10001.419999999998s)]
*  was always linked to the service of humanity in all its dimensions. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=10009.259999999998s)]
*  Spiritually united with all of Christianity, we are here in large numbers to pray for Pope Francis. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=10020.699999999999s)]
*  That God may welcome him into the immensity of his love. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=10030.46s)]
*  Pope Francis used to conclude his speeches and meetings by saying, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=10037.58s)]

*  And very shortly we will see the moment of communion. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11556.82s)]
*  Yes, this is the Lamb of God. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11561.82s)]
*  He is called to the supper of the Lamb. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11566.82s)]
*  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11579.82s)]
*  but only say the word and my soul will be healed. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11584.82s)]
*  So what we're seeing now is the distribution of communion, [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11639.82s)]
*  the consecrated host, the bread, which is the body of Christ, [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11644.82s)]
*  being distributed to all the people in the square. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11649.82s)]
*  And the choir is singing the hymn of the Lord. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11654.82s)]
*  And the choir is singing the hymn of the Lord. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11659.82s)]
*  Being distributed to all the people in the square. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11664.82s)]
*  And the choir is singing, let perpetual light shine upon him with your saints forever, [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11668.82s)]
*  for you are merciful. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11674.82s)]
*  And we have the famous psalm, out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord, Lord hear my voice. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11677.82s)]
*  What's always remarkable in these masses is how, however far away you are from the altar, [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11687.82s)]
*  somehow they get the host to you. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11692.82s)]
*  Sometimes it can be a bit of a scrum, [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11695.82s)]
*  but there's a strong principle here that everybody should receive, [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11698.82s)]
*  anybody who wants to receive will be able to. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11701.82s)]
*  It's my new quick choreographed, isn't it? [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11709.82s)]
*  It always amazes me how well it's done. It is extraordinary. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11712.82s)]
*  What I have huge experience here is these liturgies with very large amounts of people. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11717.82s)]
*  Now, because these are the clergy, they are taking communion in a slightly different way. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11726.82s)]
*  They're taking the bread and they're dipping it in milk chalice with the wine, with the sacrum. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11731.82s)]
*  So it's the body and blood of Christ. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11736.82s)]
*  For the crowds, it'll just be the host. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11739.82s)]
*  And Austin, as we're watching people receiving communion, [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11760.82s)]
*  your reflections on the service so far? [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11764.82s)]
*  I think it's been very, very solemn, very beautiful. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11769.82s)]
*  I think the homily was really a great testament to the impact that Pope Francis has had on people. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11773.82s)]
*  Cardinal Ray was stressing this, the impact that Pope Francis, [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11782.82s)]
*  how he reached people's hearts, the way he was able to communicate the message. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11786.82s)]
*  I found that very, very powerful that he underlined that. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11792.82s)]
*  And of course, so many people here now that they're receiving the host [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11796.82s)]
*  and they're going to be invited now to recollect, and we call it recollection in the Church. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11802.82s)]
*  And it's a chance to sort of, in your heart, to give thanks for the gift that is communion, [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11808.82s)]
*  but is the gift in this case, of course, that the legacy of Pope Francis, [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11815.82s)]
*  everything he gave to the Church, everything he gave to us. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11819.82s)]
*  This is a moment to absorb that and give thanks for it. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11823.82s)]
*  Alin? [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11828.82s)]
*  Well, there were moments when I was watching this extraordinary coming together of people, [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11830.82s)]
*  of course, 170 foreign delegations and religious leaders. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11834.82s)]
*  I was just struck by the fact that less than a week ago, Pope Francis was here. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11839.82s)]
*  He appeared on the balcony of St Peter's on Easter Sunday. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11846.82s)]
*  He was driven around this very square, down the very streets, which are now packed with people. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11849.82s)]
*  He blessed the crowds that have come back now, of course, [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11854.82s)]
*  filling the area around there to say farewell to him. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11858.82s)]
*  And I was struck as Austin was saying, it was fascinating to hear where the cheers, [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11862.82s)]
*  the spontaneous cheers came from the crowd, [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11869.82s)]
*  where aspects of the homily in particular resonated with him. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11871.82s)]
*  And they were, in some cases, the very words that Pope Francis had used. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11876.82s)]
*  He called, there was a moment in the homily where he said, [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11881.82s)]
*  war is a defeat for everyone. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11884.82s)]
*  That was a phrase that Pope Francis used, [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11887.82s)]
*  and that drew one of the biggest cheers through all of this, [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11889.82s)]
*  otherwise incredibly solemn and silent service, the silent mass. [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11893.82s)]
*  But during that homily, there were other aspects of Pope Francis' life [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11899.82s)]
*  that were described, things that he cared about, the environment, migrants, refugees. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11904.82s)]
*  They talked about, Cardinal Ray in that homily talked about, [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11911.82s)]
*  a mass that Pope Francis held on the Mexican-U.S. border. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11916.82s)]
*  Also got a huge cheer out there. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11922.82s)]
*  So fascinating to see the elements of this that resonated with all the people who've come out. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11924.82s)]
*  There's movement in the square, but it's also very, very quiet. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11939.82s)]
*  It is a moment of contemplation and reflection, as you said, Austin, [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11944.82s)]
*  with this ethereal music, really, heavenly music. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11949.82s)]
*  It is, it's celestial music. Exactly right. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11954.82s)]
*  And of course, what they're singing at the moment is, again, from the Psalms, [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11957.82s)]
*  like the deer that yearns for running streams. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11961.82s)]
*  So my soul is yearning for you, my God. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11964.82s)]
*  My soul is thirsting for God, the living God. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11967.82s)]
*  Francis used to so often say that faith begins in the moment [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11970.82s)]
*  that we realize that we are not self-sufficient, [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11975.82s)]
*  that we need God, we need each other, we need creation. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11979.82s)]
*  It's the myth of self-sufficiency that lies behind everything that's wrong in the world. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11984.82s)]
*  And that's why we're here today. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11990.82s)]
*  And I think that's the most important thing, [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11992.82s)]
*  It's the myth of self-sufficiency that lies behind everything that's wrong in the world. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=11994.82s)]
*  And the answer to some extent lies in our capacity, as he would say, for self-transcendence, [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12000.82s)]
*  or he used to put it more simply, to come out of ourselves, [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12006.82s)]
*  to open our hearts and minds to receive the gift of the Spirit, [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12009.82s)]
*  the gift of each other, the gift of the stranger. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12013.82s)]
*  And in that capacity lies our well-being and our salvation. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12017.82s)]
*  The clave at the moment, I was talking to her. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12054.82s)]
*  Square. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12059.82s)]
*  Mites out. [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12063.82s)]

*  Oston Ivory, just for viewers who may be joining us in this very hypnotic moment of the chanting, [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12914.82s)]
*  just explain to us one more time what it is we're hearing. [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12936.46s)]
*  This is the invocation of the saints, the calling on of the saints and martyrs throughout [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12939.34s)]
*  Christian history and of course among them are many popes who became saints. We have [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12945.06s)]
*  Leo the Great and Gregory the Great, we have also the recent popes, we have Paul the Sixth [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12951.86s)]
*  and John Paul the Second and actually that part concludes by saying all Roman popes pray for him. [[03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12957.86s)]
*  And also of course in this list are many founders of religious orders. Pope Francis was a Jesuit, [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12965.82s)]
*  the first ever pope from a religious order called the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12976.1s)]
*  founded in Spain by a Spanish nobleman Ignatius of Loyola and he's there in this list as are so [[03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12981.74s)]
*  many others and of course Francis was deeply shaped by the spirituality of the Jesuits, [[03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12991.06s)]
*  always considered himself a Jesuit even though he technically wasn't part of the order after [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=12996.82s)]
*  he became a bishop and he took the name of another saint that's in this list, [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13003.02s)]
*  Saint Francis of Assisi, a choice that profoundly surprised and shocked everybody. [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13009.46s)]
*  So, well because Saint Francis of Assisi is such a universal figure, such an iconic figure, [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13015.98s)]
*  that well no pope had ever dared I suppose take the name and I remember Francis announcing this, [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13024.98s)]
*  you know, that he would be called Francis and people wondering which Francis was, [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13034.22s)]
*  there's various Francis's and no he made it clear Francis of Assisi, love of the poor and [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13038.1s)]
*  love of creation, the two things that he wanted to communicate with that name. So a Jesuit who [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13043.42s)]
*  chose the name of a Franciscan and a reminder that popes can come from different these different [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13049.220000000001s)]
*  religious orders they're known congregations they know in other words they might be what are called [[03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13057.220000000001s)]
*  diocese and priests who become bishops or they may be from religious orders. [[03:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13063.060000000001s)]
*  God, faithful rewarder of souls, grant that your departed servant and our bishop Pope Francis, [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13132.94s)]
*  whom you made successor of Peter and shepherd of your church, may happily enjoy forever in your [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13147.5s)]

*  And we can see them here the Pope is the Pope not just of the Latin Church but also many [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13192.58s)]
*  different Eastern churches as they're known which have a different liturgy. What we're going to see [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13198.5s)]
*  now is the part of the funeral right from the Byzantine liturgy so a special set of prayers [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13204.419999999998s)]

*  major archbishops from the Eastern Catholic churches. [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13218.74s)]

*  To you, Father, source of life. [[03:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=13975.46s)]

*  And the antiphons that we're hearing now is traditionally in a funeral mass. [[03:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14014.46s)]
*  May the angels lead you into paradise. [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14021.46s)]

*  Aline. [[03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14171.46s)]
*  And what we've seen so far is a traditional funeral mass, albeit on an extraordinary stage, an extraordinary gathering. [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14174.46s)]
*  But this is where the departure from papal funerals we've seen recently will be seen. [[03:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14183.46s)]
*  As recently as two years ago, the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI, what would happen at this point is the coffin would disappear back into the papal [[03:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14188.46s)]
*  And it would be taken down to the crypt where the burial would take place. [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14190.46s)]
*  Well, Pope Francis has decided to go to the [[03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14193.46s)]
*  And that is where we're going to see the public be able to say a much more personal goodbye. [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14215.56s)]
*  And that is where we're going to see the public be able to say a much more personal goodbye. [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14218.56s)]

*  Aline, we've just seen the Cardinals make their way into St Peter's Basilica. [[03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14367.56s)]
*  What's going to happen now? [[03:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14373.56s)]
*  Well, we can just hear actually all around us spontaneous applause once again breaking out. [[03:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14375.56s)]
*  Every time that coffin has either appeared in the square or been taken away from it in recent days, [[03:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14382.56s)]
*  we've had that happen. [[03:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14389.56s)]
*  When first Pope Francis' coffin was transported here, [[03:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14391.56s)]
*  it was kept for the first couple of days in the chapel in the residence in which he lived and ultimately died. [[03:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14395.56s)]
*  When it was finally brought here in ceremony, there were cheers around the square. [[04:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14402.56s)]
*  And now it has been lifted up and it's been taken away. [[04:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14408.56s)]
*  Once again, we're having that applause. [[04:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14412.56s)]
*  You can hear it all around us as people here at least are going to say goodbyes. [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14415.56s)]
*  It will be temporarily taken through St Peter's Basilica. [[04:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14422.56s)]
*  And then, as I said before, in the recent past, the coffin will be taken down to the crypt. [[04:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14428.56s)]
*  And that's where the burial will take place. [[04:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14435.56s)]
*  On this occasion, it will temporarily be taken in by the 14 Hall Burials. [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14437.56s)]
*  And then to the side of the Basilica, it will be brought out again for that procession that will take about an hour. [[04:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14443.56s)]
*  And then there will be a burial service later in the evening. [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14451.56s)]
*  But there are lots of events until that point during the day which will bring through some of the character of the man that the world is saying farewell to, [[04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14454.56s)]
*  the involvement of the public and also waiting for him right now at the other Basilica at which he will be buried. [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14465.56s)]
*  There's a group of people from homeless shelters around Rome. [[04:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14473.56s)]
*  There are migrants there. There are Catholics and non-Catholics as well waiting for him. [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14478.56s)]
*  Right now, we can see those scenes. [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14483.56s)]
*  Waving their goodbyes. [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14487.56s)]
*  Yes, those scenes of the public here at least saying goodbyes as the coffin disappears. [[04:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14488.56s)]
*  I see many people have brought placards, often pretty foodly made notices, just saying thank you for various things. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14496.56s)]
*  I saw a group saying thank you for canonising Mother Teresa. [[04:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14503.56s)]
*  This is just a moment where the people are giving thanks as the coffin is carried out. [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14507.56s)]
*  You're here with us in a professional capacity. [[04:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14514.56s)]
*  Can you hear the pope? Can you hear him personally? How are you feeling? [[04:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14517.56s)]
*  Well, it still stings. It still feels like a shock. [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14522.56s)]
*  It's still hard to come to terms with the fact that he's no longer with us. [[04:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14526.56s)]
*  Thank you, Francis is the sign there and that's essentially what's in my heart at the moment. [[04:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14531.56s)]
*  I met up with a friend who also was close to Francis the other night and she said, [[04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14536.56s)]
*  you know, the extraordinary thing is that we knew a pope and he cared for us. [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14542.56s)]
*  What an amazing thing that is. And I think many people feel that. [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14547.56s)]
*  What an amazing person he was and how amazing was his love for us. [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14550.56s)]
*  So it stings, but above all gratitude. [[04:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14554.56s)]
*  This is the sign we're seeing there is from a project that was dear to Pope Francis' heart, [[04:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14560.56s)]
*  an educational project called Scuolas Ocorrentes. [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14564.56s)]
*  Again, they're just saying thank you. [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14567.56s)]
*  I've spoken to a lot of people around here who were upset over the last week, [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14573.56s)]
*  but they also felt through his example over the past 12 years, [[04:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14578.56s)]
*  he resented the church for them and what it was about and even outside the church. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14583.56s)]
*  Again, as we hear applause as the coffin disappears into the basilica. [[04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14589.56s)]
*  And so there was incredible sadness, but they did feel grateful that through his example, [[04:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14595.56s)]
*  he has sent out a message about what the faith is about, [[04:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14601.56s)]
*  but what humanity is also about as well. [[04:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14606.56s)]
*  It is about being the voice of the voiceless. [[04:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14609.56s)]
*  And that is why it's felt he kept on working so hard until the end, [[04:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14612.56s)]
*  because he saw an opportunity to be that voice. [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14618.56s)]
*  And although, like I say, there has been a lot of sadness at the loss, [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14622.56s)]
*  there is gratitude that that message was put out there on the global stage [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14627.56s)]
*  through his example, the focus on the poor, on migrants, the disenfranchised, [[04:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14632.56s)]
*  those who didn't have control over their own destiny. [[04:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14639.56s)]
*  This is Pope Francis' coffin on the St Peter's Square. [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14645.56s)]
*  I'm reminding you of the conversation we had a little bit earlier [[04:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14649.56s)]
*  about a story that you told of the last time Pope was here, [[04:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14654.56s)]
*  as well, on Easter Sunday. [[04:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14659.56s)]
*  Well, Cardinal Ray referred to that moment in his homily [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14662.56s)]
*  when Pope Francis, obviously gravely ill, [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14666.56s)]
*  made this extraordinary effort to be present here in the square [[04:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14671.56s)]
*  and said to his nurse, his very faithful male nurse, Massimiliano Strapetti, [[04:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14676.56s)]
*  and Strapetti said, Holy Father, you need to go and be with the people. [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14682.56s)]
*  And he said, do you think I can do it? Do you think I have the strength? [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14686.56s)]
*  And Strapetti said, yes, I know you can do it. [[04:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14690.56s)]
*  Took Francis around the square, and when Francis came back from that, [[04:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14693.56s)]
*  his very last words on this earth were to Strapetti, [[04:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14700.56s)]
*  and he just said, thank you for bringing me back to the square. [[04:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14705.56s)]
*  The square from which everything began, [[04:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14711.56s)]
*  the square where he appeared in March 2013 [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14714.56s)]
*  and bowed his head to ask for people's blessing, [[04:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14718.56s)]
*  the square where on March 27, 2020, in the middle of lockdown, [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14721.56s)]
*  he led the whole world in this extraordinary meditation [[04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14726.56s)]
*  showing that God was with us through that, [[04:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14730.56s)]
*  the square where every week he appeared and made a beeline [[04:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14732.56s)]
*  for the sick, the elderly, the man with the disfigured face, [[04:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14736.56s)]
*  the square really which was the place where he met the people [[04:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14740.56s)]
*  and the people met him, and the square from which we've just seen, [[04:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14744.56s)]
*  of course, this extraordinary, solemn, magnificent funeral. [[04:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14748.56s)]
*  And, Austin, I hope you won't mind my telling the audience, [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14755.56s)]
*  but as you've been speaking, you've had a tear in your eye. [[04:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14758.56s)]
*  Austin is nodding. [[04:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14762.56s)]
*  I've had a few of those this week. [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=14764.56s)]
*  MUSIC [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15004.56s)]
*  As we come to the end of the service, Austin Ivory, [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15034.56s)]
*  your reflections on a remarkable morning. [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15038.56s)]
*  A very Francis funeral. [[04:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15041.56s)]
*  Massive, huge numbers of people, a bright, sunny day, [[04:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15045.56s)]
*  a full-on liturgy. [[04:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15050.56s)]
*  Everything was on a huge scale. [[04:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15052.56s)]
*  I felt a fraternal moment. [[04:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15056.56s)]
*  I felt a moment of unity here today among all these people, [[04:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15059.56s)]
*  today, among all these world leaders, and I think Francis would have [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15063.56s)]
*  been delighted that we perhaps saw a little bit of God's view of the [[04:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15068.56s)]
*  world, that we are all one human family, and that's what he was [[04:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15073.56s)]
*  trying to communicate all the time. [[04:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15077.56s)]
*  I think he would have been very pleased. [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15079.56s)]
*  Well, as the crowds from St Peter's Square slowly start to disperse, [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15086.56s)]
*  there are still many, many hundreds of people, thousands of people, [[04:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15091.56s)]
*  I should say, who are still milling around and will be anxious to catch [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15097.56s)]
*  a glimpse of the procession of the coffin when it starts. [[04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15103.56s)]
*  But before that, I'd like to go to my colleague, Marion Musheery, [[04:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15109.56s)]
*  who's with some of the crowds in the square. [[04:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15113.56s)]
*  Marion. [[04:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15116.56s)]
*  Rita, well, it was quite an experience watching that funeral ceremony [[04:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15119.56s)]
*  with the crowd here in St Peter's Square. [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15124.56s)]
*  There were moments when the crowd clapped and cheered. [[04:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15126.56s)]
*  There were moments when people cried. [[04:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15129.56s)]
*  There were moments when people got on their knees and they prayed. [[04:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15131.56s)]
*  Some priests came along the crowd as well and gave the Eucharist during [[04:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15134.56s)]
*  that ceremony, too. [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15138.56s)]
*  It was very emotional and highly charged. [[04:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15139.56s)]
*  And at one point, you could see people shouting out, [[04:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15142.56s)]
*  thank you, Frances, as they carried the coffin back into St Peter's Square. [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15146.56s)]
*  Well, I found some people who watched the funeral service with us. [[04:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15152.56s)]
*  And here we have Emiliano and Agnese. [[04:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15156.56s)]
*  Emiliano, you are from Rome. [[04:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15159.56s)]
*  How was the funeral? [[04:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15161.56s)]
*  What did you feel when you stood here watching it? [[04:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15163.56s)]
*  I'm a little bit sad because we are part of the Accione Cartolica, [[04:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15166.56s)]
*  which is an organisation in Italy, [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15171.56s)]
*  which is the biggest Italian organisation of lay people here in Italy. [[04:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15174.56s)]
*  And Pope Francis loved Accione Cartolica, [[04:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15180.56s)]
*  so we have a straight relationship. [[04:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15184.56s)]
*  You felt close to him. [[04:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15188.56s)]
*  How did you feel during the funeral? [[04:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15189.56s)]
*  We used to meet many times with Pope, [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15191.56s)]
*  so it's a very big loss for us. [[04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15194.56s)]
*  We hope all the best, of course, [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15197.56s)]
*  because we really hope that the words, [[04:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15200.56s)]
*  the sentences that Pope Francis said in the past [[04:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15203.56s)]
*  will remain in the mind of the people. [[04:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15207.56s)]
*  So I hope they're really this. [[04:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15210.56s)]
*  Thank you very much, Emiliano and Agnese. [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15212.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15214.56s)]
*  And here we have a big group of young scouts who have come all the way from Padma. [[04:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15215.56s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[04:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15219.56s)]
*  Hello. [[04:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15221.56s)]
*  I'm going to speak to you, Alessandro. [[04:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15222.56s)]
*  You've been volunteer. [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15223.56s)]
*  I'm going to speak to you, Alessandro. [[04:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15224.56s)]
*  You've been volunteer to speak to me. [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15226.56s)]
*  Why are you here? [[04:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15229.56s)]
*  We are here firstly for the Jubilee, [[04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15230.56s)]
*  but it happened this tragedy, [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15234.56s)]
*  and now we are here to pay respects to the Pope. [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15236.56s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what the Pope meant to you as a group, [[04:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15243.56s)]
*  because you were supposed to come here for the Jubilee Catholic Youth Celebrations. [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15247.56s)]
*  You're here at his funeral. [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15251.56s)]
*  What did he mean to you? [[04:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15253.56s)]
*  To me, it means that we were about to do a lot of fun things, [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15255.56s)]
*  and we were about to know the Pope a little bit better, [[04:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15264.56s)]
*  but we sadly came a little bit too late, and then he died. [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15268.56s)]
*  But he was, in my perspective, he was a great man [[04:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15276.56s)]
*  that did very awesome things and that changed the vision [[04:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15281.56s)]
*  that all of us have of a Pope, [[04:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15287.56s)]
*  from someone higher than us to someone as human as us. [[04:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15290.56s)]
*  Do you feel sad, everyone, or do you feel like this is the time to look to the future? [[04:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15294.56s)]
*  Yeah, we all feel sad, but it's time to... [[04:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15300.56s)]
*  Today is the day that we look at the future, [[04:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15305.56s)]
*  and we think what to do in the future, [[04:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15309.56s)]
*  to bring his message even after his death. [[04:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15316.56s)]
*  Alessandro, thank you so much, and thank you all of you [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15320.56s)]
*  for waiting so patiently to speak to us. [[04:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15323.56s)]
*  You can say goodbye to us now. I know you want to go for your lunch. [[04:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15325.56s)]
*  I'm also joined here by a couple of nuns who have come all the way from Nigeria, [[04:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15328.56s)]
*  Sister Beatrice and Sister Lucy. [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15335.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for staying and talking to us. [[04:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15337.56s)]
*  And I saw you earlier, Sister Beatrice, you were so emotional, weren't you? [[04:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15340.56s)]
*  Yeah, I was. For me, the loss of Pope Francis is a great loss. [[04:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15344.56s)]
*  Because in him, I saw a holy man who loved the lowly, [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15353.56s)]
*  the simple, the needy, especially. [[04:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15360.56s)]
*  He has a love for little children and those in the person with special needs. [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15364.56s)]
*  He is a man of peace, and he accepts everybody, [[04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15373.56s)]
*  no matter the race, the language, where you come from. [[04:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15378.56s)]
*  So for me, we've lost a great man, [[04:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15384.56s)]
*  and I pray that whomever we are choosing as the nice Pope, [[04:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15389.56s)]
*  we also take up the legacy he has laid for the Church. [[04:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15396.56s)]
*  You want the Church to keep on the road that he wanted it to go down? [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15401.56s)]
*  I want the Church to continue, the unity of the Church to continue. [[04:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15405.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I pray for. [[04:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15411.56s)]
*  And Sister Lucy, how about you tell me a little bit about [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15414.56s)]
*  how you felt during that, at times, very emotional service? [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15417.56s)]
*  Yeah, actually, I was so emotional because I feel I can't see my father again. [[04:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15421.56s)]
*  I really miss him. [[04:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15429.56s)]
*  At the time when I was looking at the screen, [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15431.56s)]
*  I was thinking it was him that I would be seeing, [[04:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15434.56s)]
*  but I couldn't see him again because a couple of times I have come here [[04:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15438.56s)]
*  to celebrate Mass, I always see him in this. [[04:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15443.56s)]
*  Have you met him before? [[04:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15446.56s)]
*  Actually, I came during the burial of Pope Benedict, [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15448.56s)]
*  so he was there during the burial of Pope Benedict, [[04:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15452.56s)]
*  but I've not met him one-on-one. [[04:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15456.56s)]
*  And at that time, I visited the Vatican, [[04:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15459.56s)]
*  I saw him during Mass in the screen and on the altar, [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15463.56s)]
*  so now I was thinking I would see him again. [[04:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15468.56s)]
*  So if I remember, he's no longer there at Mass. [[04:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15471.56s)]
*  It makes me feel so emotional. [[04:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15476.56s)]
*  I saw you waving goodbye to him, Sister Beatrice, [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15479.56s)]
*  as they moved the coffin up the steps. [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15481.56s)]
*  Yeah, for me, I was like, oh, I will not see him again. [[04:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15484.56s)]
*  Like on 2nd February this year, when we celebrated the day of religious men and women, [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15489.56s)]
*  he was there with us at the evening Mass, presiding over the program. [[04:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15498.56s)]
*  So that was the day, even though the crowd, I couldn't touch him, [[04:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15504.56s)]
*  but it was very close. [[04:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15509.56s)]
*  You got close to him? [[04:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15513.56s)]
*  Yeah, very close. [[04:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15515.56s)]
*  So after the Mass, he moved around on the wheelchair in the church there at St Peter. [[04:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15516.56s)]
*  So for me, he's so human to everybody. [[04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15523.56s)]
*  He wants to associate with everybody, so I love him so much. [[04:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15528.56s)]
*  The other folks I have witnessed, Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict, [[04:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15533.56s)]
*  I was also here for his funeral. [[04:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15541.56s)]
*  These people, at least as an idol, I witnessed them. [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15543.56s)]
*  They are people of legacy. [[04:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15547.56s)]
*  These three people that have gone, yeah, I love them and I love their way of life. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15551.56s)]
*  I pray God also to give us a man who will also move the church forward in a positive way. [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15557.56s)]
*  That's my prayer. [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15565.56s)]
*  Sister Beatrice, Sister Lucy, I'm so grateful to both of you for staying and talking to us. [[04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15566.56s)]
*  I don't know if you can see behind me, but there are people moving now away from St Peter's Square. [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15570.56s)]
*  A lot of them are moving towards the procession route. [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15576.56s)]
*  As we mentioned earlier, the procession will take the Pope's coffin slowly in the Pope Mobile [[04:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15580.56s)]
*  from St Peter's Basilica to his final resting place at the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore. [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15585.56s)]
*  A lot of people have told me that that is where they are going to next, [[04:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15591.56s)]
*  to pay their respects as he is taken to the place where he will be buried. [[04:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15595.56s)]
*  Back to you, Rita. [[04:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15600.56s)]
*  Mariam, thank you very much. [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15605.56s)]
*  Well, we are seeing the coffin of the Pope being moved in what can only be described as a converted Pope Mobile. [[04:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15606.56s)]
*  These are details that we didn't know before. We're seeing this for the first time. [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15615.56s)]
*  And, Liam, you've had the experience, of course, of following the Pope around in his Pope Mobile during his papacy. [[04:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15626.56s)]
*  Well, of course, the last time we saw the Pope in public was in the Pope Mobile on Easter Sunday [[04:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15633.56s)]
*  as he was blessing the crowds right here and drawing energy from the crowds. [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15639.56s)]
*  That's what he did on all those foreign trips. [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15645.56s)]
*  And there was one occasion actually in South Sudan where I accidentally got caught walking right behind a Pope Mobile [[04:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15648.56s)]
*  and taking the wrong turn and ended up there and followed it all the way around. [[04:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15655.56s)]
*  It's extraordinary to see close up the way in which he was greeted [[04:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15659.56s)]
*  but also the way he loved being in a position where he was in such close contact with the public. [[04:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15665.56s)]
*  And this is extraordinary to see, this part of all of this. [[04:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15673.56s)]
*  This is how his final journey will map out. [[04:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15678.56s)]
*  But he will have those crowds lining the streets as he was used to in life as his final journey. [[04:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15682.56s)]
*  This is something we have not seen before, to have a Pope being buried some way from the Vatican. [[04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15689.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing here is him passing the Pope Mobile adapted, as you were saying, [[04:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15698.56s)]
*  just passing by the Paul VI audience hall where he would meet very, very large numbers of people. [[04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15703.56s)]
*  And I understand that the route to St Mary Major is going to take in a number of places [[04:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15709.56s)]
*  which were significant in Rome in his pontificate. [[04:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15715.56s)]
*  And there's something very special about this and I'm sure Francis would have thought about it. [[04:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15719.56s)]
*  This is also a Rome moment. He was the Bishop of Rome and he took that title seriously. [[04:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15723.56s)]
*  He was a wonderful shepherd to the people of Rome. [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15729.56s)]
*  And this of course will be a very Roman moment now that we're seeing. [[04:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15733.56s)]
*  And a chance for the Roman people to give him thanks for all that he did for them. [[04:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15737.56s)]
*  Well, we are seeing people there lining the streets. [[04:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15742.56s)]
*  The Vatican has told us that there were a quarter of a million people in the vicinity during the service. [[04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15746.56s)]
*  And we're expecting to see many tens of thousands lining the streets. [[04:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15754.56s)]
*  And as Marion was saying a little bit earlier, going to the church, St Mary Major, where he is to be buried. [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15759.56s)]
*  And it is time to talk about why he chose to be buried there for various reasons. [[04:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15766.56s)]
*  There was a little chapel there which was very dear to him. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15771.56s)]
*  It was a place he'd go to pray before and after foreign trips. [[04:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15775.56s)]
*  He had stopped there since he was discharged from hospital. [[04:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15780.56s)]
*  He'd go there often. It was one of his favorite places. [[04:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15784.56s)]
*  And it is just outside that beautiful little chapel within the Basilica that he chose the precise spot. [[04:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15787.56s)]
*  He even left a plan, the precise spot where he wanted to be buried. [[04:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15794.56s)]
*  Because it was a place for him to contemplate. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15799.56s)]
*  It was a place of peace and it was a place that he loved. [[04:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15802.56s)]
*  Well, as we can see the assembled crowds there, I just want to bring you some diplomacy that's been happening on the margins, as it were. [[04:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15806.56s)]
*  Because on a day of ceremony and reflection, it has been a day of diplomacy between world leaders who've gathered here. [[04:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15816.56s)]
*  And images have now been released by Ukrainian officials of Donald Trump's brief meeting inside St Peter's Basilica with President Zelensky. [[04:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15823.56s)]
*  As you can see, it's very much an ad hoc meeting on chairs. [[04:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15834.56s)]
*  And the two men look engrossed in deep conversation. [[04:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15839.56s)]
*  So that is quite an extraordinary image. [[04:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15844.56s)]
*  I think that's the first time that we've seen the two men together since that excoriating meeting in the White House earlier this year. [[04:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15846.56s)]
*  And Aleem, it just shows what sort of occasion this is. [[04:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15856.56s)]
*  Yes, I mean, we had some politics with a small P during the homily talking about some of the causes that Pope Francis cared about, [[04:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15860.56s)]
*  migrants and their dignity and their plight and the environment. [[04:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15867.56s)]
*  But there has been politics with a very capital P going on here because of who we have here, of course. [[04:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15873.56s)]
*  And all eyes were always going to be President Trump and President Zelensky. [[04:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15879.56s)]
*  And we believe that meeting happened after they had just each paid their respects inside the Basilica, beside the coffin of Pope Francis, and they decided to meet. [[04:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15885.56s)]
*  We hear, in fact, that there will be another meeting between the two of them later in the day. [[04:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15895.56s)]
*  But, yes, the first time that they have met face to face since February, since that dramatic coming together in the Oval Office. [[04:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15901.56s)]
*  But there is a sense that in life Pope Francis was someone who wanted to try to bring people together. [[04:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15910.56s)]
*  He was even criticized for not unequivocally condemning Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15917.56s)]
*  There were people, Catholics even in Ukraine, who said he should have done more. [[04:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15925.56s)]
*  But behind the scenes what we were being told by the Vatican was that was because he wanted to leave the door open where he could be a conduit, [[04:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15929.56s)]
*  he could help bring people together. [[04:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15937.56s)]
*  There have been other conflicts where he's helped bring people together. [[04:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15939.56s)]
*  There was an extraordinary moment where he kissed the feet of the leaders of warring factions in South Sudan. [[04:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15943.56s)]
*  There was a time where he brought together Cubans and the United States during the presidency of Barack Obama. [[04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15950.56s)]
*  He saw himself as someone who could bring people together potentially in life. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15957.56s)]
*  There were other times where he did unequivocally condemn. [[04:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15963.56s)]
*  He was certainly very strong when it came to what's going on in Gaza at the moment. [[04:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15966.56s)]
*  And he called, as we know, the church in Gaza every day. [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15971.56s)]
*  But in life, as I say, he was someone who tried to bring people together, even political leaders. [[04:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15975.56s)]
*  And it's extraordinary that it's happened through his death in this particular case. [[04:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15981.56s)]
*  This has been a day of very striking, memorable images, hasn't it, Austin? [[04:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15985.56s)]
*  Mostly to do with the service, but that image, President Trump and President Zelensky together in a makeshift, [[04:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=15992.56s)]
*  tet-a-tet, in St Peter's Basilica, we're not going to forget that, are we? [[04:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16001.56s)]
*  Not far from the Pope's coffin. [[04:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16006.56s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't invent that. [[04:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16008.56s)]
*  My sense is that they said to a Vatican official, look, we want to sit down, we want to talk, [[04:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16010.56s)]
*  and they got him those two very simple chairs. [[04:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16016.56s)]
*  It was clearly a spontaneous meeting. [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16018.56s)]
*  I think Francis, from the very beginning of the Ukraine War, wanted to be the bridge. [[04:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16021.56s)]
*  He went straight out, he came out of the papal residence and visited the Russian ambassador, [[04:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16026.56s)]
*  breaking, by the way, every protocol. [[04:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16032.56s)]
*  The ambassadors are supposed to go and visit the Pope, not the other way around. [[04:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16034.56s)]
*  And Francis said to the Russian ambassador, whatever I can do, whatever the Vatican can do, we will do it. [[04:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16037.56s)]
*  He really, really wanted the Vatican to be the place to create that space for that dialogue that could lead to peace. [[04:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16043.56s)]
*  And I think there's something very wonderful about if this does lead to peace, [[04:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16051.56s)]
*  and we've heard so many promises that have been broken in recent weeks, [[04:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16055.56s)]
*  but if this is some kind of a breakthrough moment, well, I think we'll be talking about it in the future. [[04:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16058.56s)]
*  I think we will. [[04:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16064.56s)]
*  The Pope's Coffin is being transported through a very carefully prepared route. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16084.56s)]
*  All the roads leading into St Peter's and across the city have been cordoned off, [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16090.56s)]
*  the pavement area has been cordoned off to allow for crowds to gather, and they really have. [[04:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16098.56s)]
*  As I'm watching this, I'm reminded of many sort of surprise moments when Francis would suddenly appear somewhere in Rome. [[04:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16109.56s)]
*  I remember there was one time he came to get a fresh pair of glasses [[04:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16117.56s)]
*  and just suddenly appeared outside an optician, another time outside a record store. [[04:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16121.56s)]
*  He was one for that. He liked to have the freedom to go places in Rome. [[04:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16126.56s)]
*  He knew, of course, that a Pope can't just simply move around, you know, he needs people with him, [[04:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16133.56s)]
*  but he would arrange these moments with the minimum security, always in his little fiat Uno. [[04:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16138.56s)]
*  And the delight of people when somebody would see the Pope appear was, I think, a source of great joy to him. [[04:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16144.56s)]
*  He must have felt it was his city. [[04:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16151.56s)]
*  I think he did, and I think he always took his role as pastor, as Bishop of Rome, very, very seriously. [[04:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16153.56s)]
*  Early on in the pontificate, he came to a stop with Covid, but he used to celebrate a Mass every morning [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16160.56s)]
*  in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence, and I went a number of times. [[04:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16168.56s)]
*  And I was always struck because there in the congregation, it was not a big chapel, [[04:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16173.56s)]
*  but it was where his body was laid to rest earlier this week, [[04:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16177.56s)]
*  there would always be a group of people from a parish in Rome. [[04:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16180.56s)]
*  So the idea was, of course, the Pope couldn't simply go to every parish in Rome, [[04:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16184.56s)]
*  but the idea was that over those years, every parish in Rome had the opportunity to send a few people to be at Mass with him. [[04:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16188.56s)]
*  Again, little things which were the mark of the seriousness with which he took his role. [[04:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16195.56s)]
*  People hanging out of balconies, Alim, and this applause that's moving down the line, [[04:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16201.56s)]
*  it feels as if the whole city is a podium. [[04:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16207.56s)]
*  He was always about connection with people. [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16209.56s)]
*  A lot of us talk about the fact that he never moved to the papal apartment behind us because of modesty. [[04:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16211.56s)]
*  Actually, he's written many times and talked many times about the fact that he just felt so far removed. [[04:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16219.56s)]
*  That was the main reason, that he couldn't entertain there, that he couldn't be around people. [[04:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16224.56s)]
*  And actually, he wanted to stay in the hostel, the Santa Marta Art Hostel, so he could be close to people. [[04:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16228.56s)]
*  What extraordinary pictures these are. [[04:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16233.56s)]
*  And the Coliseum, of course, is where every Easter there's the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday. [[04:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16235.56s)]
*  So every year he was at the Coliseum, at least not in recent years because of his health, but an important place. [[04:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16242.56s)]
*  It goes particularly loud here. [[04:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16259.56s)]
*  As we watch this, Austin, it's maybe a moment to reflect on what we heard earlier during the service. [[04:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16267.56s)]
*  And I know you particularly want to talk about the homily, which was very personal to Pope Francis. [[04:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16274.56s)]
*  I was really struck by the homily given by Cardinal Wray. [[04:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16282.56s)]
*  It was about 20 minutes long. [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16286.56s)]
*  And it was really full of the things that he was underlining about the pontificate. [[04:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16288.56s)]
*  Obviously, he had a lot to choose from. [[04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16295.56s)]
*  So what he chose to emphasize, I see as a Vatican analyst, I think, well, he's sending certain messages there. [[04:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16297.56s)]
*  What were they? [[04:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16305.56s)]
*  Well, he's the Dean of the College of Cardinals. [[04:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16306.56s)]
*  His task is to shepherd the Cardinals into this next role that they have, the very important role of electing Francis' successor. [[04:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16309.56s)]
*  So what he's stressing to them, I think, is important. [[04:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16317.56s)]
*  And what he did stress was how Francis evangelized and how successfully he evangelized. [[04:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16321.56s)]
*  He said evangelization was the key thing, the great uniting element of his pontificate. [[04:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16327.56s)]
*  He's talked about his spontaneity, his informal way of addressing people, even those far from the church, his human warmth, [[04:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16333.56s)]
*  the way his message could reach people's hearts in a direct and immediate way, how he had a charism of welcoming and listening, the way he touched hearts. [[04:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16340.56s)]
*  I think he was saying to the Cardinals, this is how you evangelize in the 10th century. [[04:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16350.56s)]
*  This is the kind of way that the Pope needs to be and the church needs to be. [[04:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16357.56s)]
*  And I think they will have been very attentive to that and they will have noticed, the Cardinals, that is, [[04:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16362.56s)]
*  those moments when Aline was saying, people burst into applause. [[04:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16368.56s)]
*  The people of God were giving their own verdict when they clapped like that. [[04:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16372.56s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[04:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16376.56s)]
*  I mean, to talk so overtly in that homily about the issues that Pope Francis cared about, to talk about the environment, [[04:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16377.56s)]
*  to talk about peace using the words that Pope Francis had used himself in life, saying that war was in itself a defeat for everyone. [[04:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16385.56s)]
*  And that's something Pope Francis has said a lot. [[04:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16392.56s)]
*  War in itself was a failure. [[04:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16395.56s)]
*  And to hear at those moments how those themes resonated with the crowd around her, [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16398.56s)]
*  that spontaneous applause, would, as Austen say, very much have been a message that the Cardinals who were going to elect her successor heard loud and clear. [[04:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16405.56s)]
*  And on that note, we've just seen the Basilica of St. Mary in Major Whitt, which is going to receive the coffin. [[04:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16412.56s)]
*  They just gave us a little clip there of it. [[04:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16419.56s)]
*  And of course, waiting to receive Pope Francis will not be the dignitaries, the hierarchs, the Cardinals, the cardinals, the cardinals, the cardinals. [[04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16422.56s)]
*  But a group of poor, of homeless people there to receive it. [[04:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16431.56s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing. [[04:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16436.56s)]
*  And that was his wish? [[04:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16439.56s)]
*  That was his wish. [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16441.56s)]
*  All of this is his wish. [[04:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16442.56s)]
*  All of this is... [[04:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16444.56s)]
*  He sat down, I think after Benedict's funeral in early 23, I think Francis sat down and thought, you know what? [[04:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16445.56s)]
*  I need to start thinking about this. [[04:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16451.56s)]
*  And he last year revised these rules for the funeral and made his own wishes clear. [[04:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16453.56s)]
*  Just going back to the homily for him, I was actually very also delighted that Cardinal Ray mentioned this extraordinary document that Francis produced in 2019 with a man, [[04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16459.56s)]
*  with a man, the Sheikh, Sheikh Al-Tayyab, really a leading figure of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16462.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16468.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16472.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16478.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16483.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16486.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16488.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16490.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16492.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16494.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16496.56s)]
*  And he then went on to say that he was going to be the leader of the Sunni Muslim world. [[04:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16498.56s)]
*  He was taking on either people who want to use religion to justify violence, [[04:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16500.56s)]
*  but also to prevent, as it were, certain political groups wanting to exploit that, [[04:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16505.56s)]
*  you know, populist groups and so on. [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16510.56s)]
*  So he kind of saw this polarization and acted to break it through, [[04:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16513.56s)]
*  built this extraordinary relationship with Sheikh Al-Tayyab of the Al-Azhar Institute in Egypt. [[04:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16518.56s)]
*  And the two of them developed this remarkable friendship. [[04:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16523.56s)]
*  And that really tells you everything. [[04:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16526.56s)]
*  It was his capacity for friendship, Francis's capacity, [[04:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16528.56s)]
*  that led to so many important projects in his pontificate [[04:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16531.56s)]
*  and so many key breakthroughs because he had this capacity to build trust. [[04:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16535.56s)]
*  We are seeing the procession going through many iconic Roman sites [[04:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16541.56s)]
*  that people will recognize just past the palace of Victor Emmanuel. [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16550.56s)]
*  On its way up towards the Colosseum. [[04:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16557.56s)]
*  And every inch of space taken up by members of the public, [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16569.56s)]
*  clapping and trying to record the moment. [[04:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16574.56s)]
*  And what a beautiful spring day for all of this. [[04:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16579.56s)]
*  I've so often been in Rome where it's really hot [[04:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16582.56s)]
*  and the crowds, it can get very uncomfortable, but this feels very different. [[04:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16586.56s)]
*  Temperature's lovely. [[04:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16590.56s)]
*  There aren't too many people, but there are enough people [[04:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16592.56s)]
*  to show just how much you touch people's hearts. [[04:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16595.56s)]
*  You just see the Colosseum. [[04:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16598.56s)]
*  We could just see it. [[04:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16602.56s)]
*  We could just see the Colosseum ahead, where the procession is going. [[04:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16604.56s)]
*  Aleem Austin mentioned earlier when we were talking about the homily, [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16614.56s)]
*  about the discrete message to the cardinals [[04:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16619.56s)]
*  about the task that they have ahead of them. [[04:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16622.56s)]
*  Just remind us about the role of the cardinals in choosing the newspaper. [[04:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16625.56s)]
*  Well, the next pope, there are only two rules for who a pope can be. [[04:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16630.56s)]
*  They need to be a baptized Catholic and they need to be men. [[04:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16635.56s)]
*  But in recent centuries, more often than not, it has been a cardinal, [[04:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16639.56s)]
*  so they are selecting one of their own to take on the role. [[04:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16643.56s)]
*  And it is only cardinals under the age of 80 who will be allowed to vote, [[04:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16648.56s)]
*  135 of them. [[04:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16652.56s)]
*  What is extraordinary is that the cardinals are allowed to vote [[04:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16654.56s)]
*  and they are allowed to vote. [[04:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16658.56s)]
*  What is extraordinary this time around, thanks to Pope Francis, [[04:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16661.56s)]
*  is that we are going to have the most diverse conclave there has ever been. [[04:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16665.56s)]
*  Around 80% of those who are taking part in the voting process are cardinals [[04:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16670.56s)]
*  that were appointed by Pope Francis himself. [[04:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16675.56s)]
*  And while we have been talking about this homily and about him reaching [[04:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16679.56s)]
*  out to other faiths, well, he was certainly reaching out to Catholics [[04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16683.56s)]
*  and he was able to vote. [[04:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16687.56s)]
*  He made it a point to appoint cardinals from Africa, from South America, [[04:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16689.56s)]
*  from Asia. [[04:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16694.56s)]
*  But it also means this is an incredibly unpredictable conclave. [[04:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16696.56s)]
*  Because these cardinals, as well as many of them being fairly new to [[04:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16701.56s)]
*  their roles, they are also, because of their geographical locations, [[04:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16705.56s)]
*  ones who haven't spent as much time together perhaps as cardinals in the [[04:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16709.56s)]
*  past. [[04:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16713.56s)]
*  They are getting to know each other now. [[04:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16714.56s)]
*  They have been getting to know each other around the events of this funeral, [[04:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16716.56s)]
*  their meeting, their coffees, their dinners, and certainly will be in [[04:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16720.56s)]
*  the coming days. [[04:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16724.56s)]
*  But I think Austin is absolutely right. [[04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16725.56s)]
*  The way in which Cardinal Wade formulated that homily, the themes he [[04:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16728.56s)]
*  decided to touch on, the fact that the crowd responded to those bits of the [[04:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16735.56s)]
*  homily that they did about the issues that Pope Francis cared about was [[04:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16741.56s)]
*  certainly a message to those cardinals about perhaps where they should be [[04:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16746.56s)]
*  looking when it comes to Pope Francis' successor. [[04:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16751.56s)]
*  And, look, people have been asking a lot this week, as we see these [[04:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16754.56s)]
*  stunning pictures around Coliseum. [[04:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16759.56s)]
*  People have been asking, they want to categorise Pope Francis as to [[04:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16763.56s)]
*  whether he was liberal and progressive or conservative. [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16766.56s)]
*  Well, it's a bit more nuanced than that. [[04:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16769.56s)]
*  He was certainly someone who wanted to reach out, that's for sure. [[04:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16771.56s)]
*  And he wanted to reorient the Church. [[04:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16775.56s)]
*  But there were aspects of his outlook that remained very conservative. [[04:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16778.56s)]
*  And people think because he appointed a lot of these cardinals, somehow the [[04:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16783.56s)]
*  next pope will be someone in Pope Francis' image. [[04:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16787.56s)]
*  Actually, among the cardinals that he appointed are people with all kinds of [[04:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16791.56s)]
*  political outlooks, some very conservative, some very liberal. [[04:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16798.56s)]
*  I think that was by design, Austin. [[04:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16804.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Jesuit superior general said the other day, the job of [[04:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16807.56s)]
*  the cardinals is not to elect the successor of Francis, but to elect the [[04:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16810.56s)]
*  successor of Peter. [[04:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16814.56s)]
*  And, of course, Francis is the great example that they've got before them [[04:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16815.56s)]
*  now, but they must choose from among themselves. [[04:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16819.56s)]
*  And what Francis sought to do in his choice of cardinals was to reconfigure [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16823.56s)]
*  the College of Cardinals as the body is known in such a way that we have now [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16829.56s)]
*  over 90, I think it was 97 different countries among the electors, among the [[04:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16834.56s)]
*  135 electors. [[04:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16840.56s)]
*  And he appointed cardinals, and this is where he really broke with his [[04:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16842.56s)]
*  tradition, in appointing cardinals from countries where there were small, [[04:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16845.56s)]
*  often very small, Christian populations. [[04:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16850.56s)]
*  Because he wanted the voice, as it were, of the little flocks of the people [[04:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16853.56s)]
*  on the front line of inter-religious dialogue, of war and so on, to be present [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16858.56s)]
*  in the room when the cardinals next week, as they will begin now, begin [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16863.56s)]
*  discussing the kind of profile of the pope that the world needs now and the [[04:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16868.56s)]
*  church needs now. [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16874.56s)]
*  They will begin with, well, what is the world doing at the moment? [[04:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16876.56s)]
*  What is the reality? [[04:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16880.56s)]
*  And that's where the voice of these people from the peripheries of the [[04:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16882.56s)]
*  church are very, very important, because they bring reality into it. [[04:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16885.56s)]
*  But the flip side of that, as Aline was saying, is that they have a big task of [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16890.56s)]
*  getting to know each other and building that consensus among them. [[04:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16895.56s)]
*  I think what Francis wanted was a proper, what they Jesuits call a [[04:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16899.56s)]
*  discernment, a real proper discernment. [[04:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16903.56s)]
*  What is God asking of the church at this time? [[04:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16906.56s)]
*  And for that, they need to begin with the reality of how things are. [[04:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16908.56s)]
*  Our attentions will be turning towards that next week, but for the moment, [[04:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16912.56s)]
*  it is an astonishing sight, isn't it, line upon line upon line of people. [[04:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16920.56s)]
*  It's lovely. [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16926.56s)]
*  I have a little smile on my face, because just thinking about how Pope [[04:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16927.56s)]
*  Francis had planned that the final goodbye wouldn't happen, it wouldn't [[04:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16931.56s)]
*  be the dignitaries, it wouldn't be the heads of state and the reigning [[04:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16937.56s)]
*  monarchs that would say the last goodbye. [[04:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16943.56s)]
*  But this is how he wanted it. [[04:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16946.56s)]
*  He left all of that behind. [[04:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16949.56s)]
*  Just as he did on his trips, the diplomatic events will always be as [[04:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16951.56s)]
*  brief as possible. [[04:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16956.56s)]
*  There were times when he looked like he was even sort of nodding off, and [[04:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16958.56s)]
*  certainly there were times when he didn't look happy to be there. [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16962.56s)]
*  He wanted to spend, and sometimes the other events where he was spending [[04:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16965.56s)]
*  time with people would go on much longer than they should have done, because [[04:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16969.56s)]
*  he was just caught up in conversation. [[04:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16974.56s)]
*  That was his life, the connection. [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16976.56s)]
*  And as we've been talking about his ideas for the way forward at the [[04:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16980.56s)]
*  Cardinals, he was about the peripheries, people on the peripheries of [[04:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16985.56s)]
*  the Catholic world, people on the peripheries of the margins of life as [[04:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16990.56s)]
*  well, and society. [[04:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16995.56s)]
*  He was about getting to everybody, if he could. [[04:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=16998.56s)]
*  There's clapping going on on the streets as the procession goes past. [[04:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17007.56s)]
*  There's clapping here still at St Peter's, because there are lots of [[04:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17012.56s)]
*  people hanging on, watching the procession on big screens. [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17017.56s)]
*  So we can hear a double clapping. [[04:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17021.56s)]
*  They loved this. [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17024.56s)]
*  I can see that they really loved this part. [[04:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17026.56s)]
*  As I say, completely unprecedented. [[04:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17029.56s)]
*  It's kind of unscripted. [[04:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17032.56s)]
*  We didn't know that it was going to happen like this. [[04:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17034.56s)]
*  We journalists didn't have a huge amount of information about what was going to [[04:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17037.56s)]
*  happen. [[04:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17040.56s)]
*  We were just very keeping with him. [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17041.56s)]
*  The Pope of surprises. [[04:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17044.56s)]
*  He'll always keep us guessing. [[04:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17046.56s)]
*  But yeah, the Roman people, of course, often have very clear judgments of [[04:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17048.56s)]
*  popes. [[04:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17052.56s)]
*  Famously, they called John XXIII the one who called the Vatican Council. [[04:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17054.56s)]
*  He was known as Ipapa buon, or the good pope. [[04:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17058.56s)]
*  What everybody has said to me in Rome, if I talk to somebody, I don't know, [[04:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17061.56s)]
*  somebody, a cleaning lady or something, and I ask them about Francis, they [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17065.56s)]
*  say, we need another pope like him. [[04:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17069.56s)]
*  Please give us another good. [[04:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17072.56s)]
*  By good, buono, they mean kind, they mean warm, they mean somebody who can [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17074.56s)]
*  relate from the heart, which is really what Francis could do. [[04:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17079.56s)]
*  That's not to say we didn't have those critics. [[04:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17083.56s)]
*  There were some, even in the upper echelons of the church, who felt there [[04:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17086.56s)]
*  was a bit of a cultic personality around Pope Francis that they were [[04:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17091.56s)]
*  uncomfortable with. [[04:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17095.56s)]
*  He was too much of a populist and that he had broken away from tradition too [[04:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17097.56s)]
*  much. [[04:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17102.56s)]
*  But you can see what the public felt about the fact that he was doing that, [[04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17103.56s)]
*  that he was trying to get to understand where people were in their day-to-day [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17108.56s)]
*  faith, in their day-to-day lives, and that was his focus. [[04:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17114.56s)]
*  But like I say, there were predecessors of his who it seemed were fine with a [[04:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17118.56s)]
*  smaller, purer church. [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17124.56s)]
*  He was not about that. [[04:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17127.56s)]
*  He was about expanding the fold to include people even outside the faith. [[04:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17129.56s)]
*  Towards the end of the pontificate, the great phrase, todos, todos, todos in [[04:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17134.56s)]
*  Spanish, which he used in Lisbon in 2023 in the World Youth Day when he was [[04:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17140.56s)]
*  addressing 1.5 million young people, and he said the church is for everybody. [[04:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17146.56s)]
*  Todos, todos, todos. [[04:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17151.56s)]
*  It became this great slogan. [[04:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17152.56s)]
*  When he was on the plane, the journalist said, what do you mean by that? [[04:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17154.56s)]
*  He said, the church is for everybody. [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17157.56s)]
*  They're once inside, they're going to have problems with things. [[04:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17159.56s)]
*  We'll work it out. [[04:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17162.56s)]
*  It's a broad church. [[04:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17164.56s)]
*  But come in first and then we'll work it out. [[04:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17166.56s)]
*  There will be things you find difficult. [[04:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17168.56s)]
*  Let's start with the welcome. [[04:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17170.56s)]
*  Well, here the procession. [[04:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17172.56s)]
*  The Pope Mobile, I think we have to call it that. [[04:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17176.56s)]
*  Has arrived at the church at St Mary Major. [[04:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17180.56s)]
*  This is the church outside the Vatican where Pope Francis will be buried. [[04:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17184.56s)]
*  The burial itself is a private message. [[04:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17191.56s)]
*  We're not going to see it. [[04:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17194.56s)]
*  We do know we've had a picture of where he's going to be entombed, I think is [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17196.56s)]
*  the word, laid anyway. [[04:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17202.56s)]
*  It will be a simple stone place where his body will be entombed and the word on [[04:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17204.56s)]
*  it, franciscus, francis in Latin. [[04:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17213.56s)]
*  So what we're going to see now is the coffin being taken into the basilica and [[04:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17216.56s)]
*  then the entombment itself will take place this evening as I understand it. [[04:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17223.56s)]
*  There, by the way, is the famous icon where he used to pray. [[04:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17227.56s)]
*  Every time he went on a trip he would come here first to pray and then after a [[04:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17231.56s)]
*  trip he would come back and give thanks. [[04:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17236.56s)]
*  The icon he also had with him that famous night on the 27th of March when he [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17238.56s)]
*  prayed for the whole world. [[04:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17242.56s)]
*  It was up there with him in the square. [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17244.56s)]
*  In a city of 400 churches, why St Mary Major? [[04:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17248.56s)]
*  Why did it mean so much to him? [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17254.56s)]
*  Because of the icon fundamentally. [[04:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17256.56s)]
*  The icon is Mary who, the health of the Roman people. [[04:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17258.56s)]
*  So she's the great protector of the Roman people. [[04:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17264.56s)]
*  So he, long before he became Pope, he had an affinity with this icon and with her [[04:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17268.56s)]
*  and knew the basilica well. [[04:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17274.56s)]
*  So as Pope he simply carried on or deepened that relationship. [[04:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17276.56s)]
*  I remember when he came out of hospital on the way back home to convalesce he asked [[04:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17281.56s)]
*  the car to stop outside the basilica. [[04:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17287.56s)]
*  He couldn't go in but he just left flowers there. [[04:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17289.56s)]
*  He always used to leave flowers. [[04:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17292.56s)]
*  He was faithful to his Virgin. [[04:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17294.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17310.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17312.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17314.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17316.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17318.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17320.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17322.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17324.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17326.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17328.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17330.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17332.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17334.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17336.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17338.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17340.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17342.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17344.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17346.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17348.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17350.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17352.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17354.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17356.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17358.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17362.56s)]
*  The bell. [[04:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17364.56s)]
*  As the coffin is carried into the church, Alim, tell us something about the people who [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17366.56s)]
*  are waiting to receive it. [[04:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17384.640000000003s)]
*  So another extraordinary detail, all through following Pope Francis instructions, there [[04:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17386.88s)]
*  is going to be a group on these steps that greets the coffin before it goes into the [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17392.44s)]
*  basilica. [[04:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17399.0s)]
*  And those are a group of what the Vatican first described as the poor and needy. [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17400.0s)]
*  They are in fact those who access the facilities of homeless shelters around the city. [[04:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17404.359999999997s)]
*  They include Catholics, but they also include an Orthodox Christian from Egypt, a Turkish, [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17410.28s)]
*  Kurdish, Muslim refugee, and an Iraqi refugee as well. [[04:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17416.68s)]
*  So a sense that after all the pageantry, all the ceremony and all the delegations here, [[04:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17422.22s)]
*  that actually the last goodbye is from a group like that. [[04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17433.02s)]
*  This is all unprecedented, isn't it, Austin, from everything that Alim has just said about [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17443.18s)]
*  the people who are waiting to receive him, to the fact that this is happening at all [[04:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17448.26s)]
*  in St Mary's, this hasn't happened before. [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17452.5s)]
*  Well there are, I understand, other popes buried actually in St Mary's, but many, many [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17455.98s)]
*  hundreds of years ago. [[04:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17460.859999999997s)]
*  In modern times, I should say. [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17461.859999999997s)]
*  In modern times, you always have to say that with the Vatican because there is usually [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17462.859999999997s)]
*  a precedent somewhere. [[04:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17466.3s)]
*  But it is remarkable in the modern age that a pope should choose to be buried in a place [[04:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17467.3s)]
*  where by tradition in the early church, the slaves were buried. [[04:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17473.82s)]
*  It was a place outside the city. [[04:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17479.86s)]
*  Now it's very much part of Rome. [[04:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17482.26s)]
*  But this identification with the poor really is what it's about. [[04:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17484.26s)]
*  Again, remember, we were talking earlier about the funeral and how he's changed things, [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17489.98s)]
*  and the explanation given to the Cardinals that Francis wanted to be buried not as a [[04:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17495.02s)]
*  man of power, but as a disciple of Christ. [[04:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17502.059999999998s)]
*  And I think this is what we're seeing. [[04:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17506.059999999998s)]
*  In the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we ask that you [[04:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17591.94s)]
*  be with us. [[04:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17741.94s)]
*  And a moment there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17742.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17745.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17746.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17747.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17748.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17749.94s)]
*  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, [[04:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17750.94s)]
*  many. [[04:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17752.94s)]
*  And a moment there of standing with the coffin in front of the icon that meant so much to [[04:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17753.94s)]
*  Pope Francis. [[04:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17775.94s)]
*  As he so often did, he would sit for sometimes 20 minutes, 25 minutes, praying to her very [[04:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17776.94s)]
*  still, always with a bouquet of flowers. It was lovely to see the children, who those [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17785.78s)]
*  flowers are. [[04:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17791.34s)]
*  It's been a morning of such contrasts, Alim. We've had the very high ceremony of the service [[04:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17795.94s)]
*  and then the coffin being driven through the crowds, all applauding, sometimes cheering, [[04:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17803.260000000002s)]
*  and now again, ceremony, celebrity. [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17810.260000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's been fascinating seeing the departures, if you like, from recent paper funerals, the [[04:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17815.260000000002s)]
*  connection with people, the driving through the streets, the small group, as we were talking [[04:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17822.460000000003s)]
*  about, the group to the coffin. But there's no doubt that being in amongst this, you feel [[04:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17827.86s)]
*  that this is something significant, you feel that this is a momentous occasion. Yes, we're [[04:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17834.86s)]
*  talking about somebody who led the world's more than a billion Catholics, but a huge [[04:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17841.86s)]
*  global figure as well. [[04:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17848.66s)]
*  So certainly the sense that something significant has happened here. We talked at the very beginning [[04:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17854.36s)]
*  of this programme, we're outside St Peter's Basilica where we are, named after the disciple [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17858.16s)]
*  of Christ, and we're talking about the saying farewell to one of his successors, his 265th [[04:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17864.16s)]
*  as Catholics believe it. So for all the departures, for all the moments that Pope Francis had an [[04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17874.760000000002s)]
*  influence over through the instructions that he left, this has still felt like a huge historic [[04:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17883.36s)]
*  moment. [[04:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17891.66s)]
*  A historic moment and also a global moment, there'll be millions watching around the world. [[04:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17892.66s)]
*  Yes, I think he would have liked to have used the word universal rather than global, because [[04:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17906.66s)]
*  universality means that you have a kind of a larger view of things, but you take into [[04:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17911.26s)]
*  account the particularity of difference. Diversity is of God, he used to say. Division is not, [[04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17916.36s)]
*  but diversity is. He loved diversity, he didn't mind being criticised, he loved to dialogue [[04:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17924.36s)]
*  with people who had completely different views from him. And the universality therefore of [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17931.16s)]
*  this moment is the coming together of people in their own difference and embracing that [[04:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17936.76s)]
*  and seeing that beyond those differences we have a higher unity. And he was always calling [[04:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17943.16s)]
*  us to that unity and he often failed and it was a source of deep sadness and frustration [[04:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17949.26s)]
*  to him that we continued to be at war, that the world was incapable of stopping those [[04:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17956.059999999998s)]
*  wars, that we continued to leave people at the side of the road, to discard people, to [[04:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17962.46s)]
*  be prejudiced against them. But he did his utmost in these last 12 years to call us into [[04:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17968.46s)]
*  that human family, that oneness, which he believed God in becoming incarnate, becoming [[04:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17975.16s)]
*  human was calling us to in the life of Jesus, which the church now continues and has continued [[04:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17983.760000000002s)]
*  for the last 2000 years to proclaim and to promote and he saw himself as carrying out [[04:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17989.86s)]
*  that mission and I think we can say and I'm sure many people will say he was a good and [[04:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=17995.16s)]
*  faithful servant of that mission. Whether or not he succeeded he was faithful to it. [[05:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18001.260000000002s)]
*  Aleem, in the last few moments of our broadcast this morning, can you sum up the legacy of [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18008.260000000002s)]
*  Pope Francis and how he's left the church? He was unquestionably someone who led the [[05:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18016.059999999998s)]
*  church through a very consequential phase. He took the church to a different direction. [[05:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18023.559999999998s)]
*  He was about, something he talked about a lot, reaching out, reaching out to the peripheries [[05:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18031.059999999998s)]
*  of his own faith, reaching out to others, reaching out to those perhaps without status [[05:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18038.059999999998s)]
*  who don't have their destinies in their control and that's where he took the church, about [[05:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18045.16s)]
*  reorientating it away from the hierarchy, away from Rome and more to the understanding [[05:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18052.36s)]
*  of people, not just the faithful, not just Catholics, but people in their daily lives [[05:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18059.86s)]
*  and daily struggles through his example. There were some people within the church who cringed [[05:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18064.86s)]
*  at that. The culture divide exists in the Catholic Church just as it does around the [[05:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18071.26s)]
*  world. That is a consequence of where we are as a world right now. There are those who [[05:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18075.86s)]
*  cringed, for example, just six months ago when he was in a mosque in Indonesia and kissed [[05:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18081.86s)]
*  the hand of the Imam there. But there were those who took great message from those acts, [[05:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18086.66s)]
*  the fact that he had refocused on the poor, the disadvantaged, the marginalised and even [[05:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18094.56s)]
*  outside of faith, there are those who felt, and we have seen that from the tributes we [[05:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18101.56s)]
*  have seen over the last week, who felt he spoke for them, whether they were within the [[05:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18106.76s)]
*  faith or not because of the causes he championed. [[05:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18110.86s)]
*  Eileen McBall, Austin Ivory, it has been wonderful to share this morning and this service with [[05:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18114.66s)]
*  you both. Thank you very much for your insights and your information. I have seen that it [[05:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18122.56s)]
*  has been for you, Austin, quite an emotional morning as well. You knew the Pope and so [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18128.26s)]
*  while you shared your professional knowledge, it has also been a personal moment for you [[05:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18135.46s)]
*  too. Thank you very much for being here. [[05:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18140.46s)]
*  That is all from us here at the Vatican. We are going to be leaving you with some of the [[05:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18144.16s)]
*  most moving moments of the last few hours. We have had pageantry, we have had ceremony, [[05:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18149.26s)]
*  we have had tradition and we have also had the simple human warmth of many hundreds of [[05:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18155.46s)]
*  thousands of people who have gathered here to say goodbye to Pope Francis. And from us, [[05:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18162.26s)]
*  it is goodbye. [[05:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18168.859999999997s)]
*  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. [[05:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18179.859999999997s)]
*  Ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne [[05:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18193.859999999997s)]
*  est, ne est, ne est, ne est, ne estverun pa es. [[05:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqCVSj-1zNA&t=18209.26s)]
