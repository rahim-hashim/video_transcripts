Video Description: Video games and music live in (almost) perfect harmony - so which video game would the bands of Download Festival like to see themselves in?
 
Members of Bullet For My Valentine, Dayseeker, McFly, Jimmy Eat World, Kittie, Don Broco and Rise Against caught up with us to tell us which game they'd like to hear one of their tracks on - and Malevolence's Alex Taylor may have let slip some Grand Theft Auto VI gossip.
 
Meanwhile, Alien Ant Farm said it was a 'bummer' not to be invited back to feature as one of the artists on the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 remakes, revealing what happened.

*  Specifically Dr. Mario. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=7.0s)]
*  It would have to be Grand Theft Auto. The new Grand Theft Auto. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=9.0s)]
*  You've never been featured on a gaming soundtrack. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=18.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=20.0s)]
*  But if you could pick any game to be on the soundtrack of, what would it be? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=21.0s)]
*  Would it be Tony Hawk? Would it be Doom? What are you thinking? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=23.0s)]
*  I mean me personally, I'm sorry, it would have to be FIFA. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, sorry about that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=29.0s)]
*  But Doug plays some serious games. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=31.0s)]
*  He's a serious gamer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=34.0s)]
*  Maybe like Assassin's Creed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=36.0s)]
*  That would be cool. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=38.0s)]
*  That would be cool. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=40.0s)]
*  Does Call of Duty have music? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=44.0s)]
*  Call of Duty? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would be fun. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=47.0s)]
*  You know, you just shot a few people on McFly! [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=49.0s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=51.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=53.0s)]
*  I think that would be my two. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=54.0s)]
*  Or maybe like, if Doom came back. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've had a recent game. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=60.0s)]
*  So it just came out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=62.0s)]
*  Well my PlayStation is in storage at the minute. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we're renovating. So I've not updated anything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=68.0s)]
*  Get on it when you can. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=71.0s)]
*  Super Mario Kart. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=72.0s)]
*  Yes, that would be amazing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=74.0s)]
*  To be able to launch turtles at your friends is always a fun thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=76.0s)]
*  Like with a Rick Burch themed Mario Kart? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, a driver. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=84.0s)]
*  Maybe you could even get involved in the next Super Mario Brothers movie soundtrack. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=86.0s)]
*  Who knows? That could be a cool one. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would love that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=91.0s)]
*  My kids got really into Fortnite. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=92.0s)]
*  And I know we had a track on the Fortnite radio. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=95.0s)]
*  And that was like huge. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=98.0s)]
*  But I was pretty unaware of it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=100.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's like a thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=102.0s)]
*  So it would be great to be back in Fortnite. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=104.0s)]
*  The game we play the most on the bus is Fortnite. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=107.0s)]
*  We're kind of relatively new to it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=111.0s)]
*  I think maybe like it was only three or four years ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=115.0s)]
*  We brought Switches on tour to play Mario Kart. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=119.0s)]
*  And we were like, we should probably, everyone's down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=124.0s)]
*  Fortnite's been around for a while. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=126.0s)]
*  We should probably get involved in that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=128.0s)]
*  And honestly, the after show fun on the bus. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=130.0s)]
*  Playing online is like cool and all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=135.0s)]
*  But just being back with your mates on the bus, just screaming, running around. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=137.0s)]
*  It's just so stupid, so fun. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=143.0s)]
*  And yeah, I haven't felt anything like that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=146.0s)]
*  I mean, it would show my age now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=150.0s)]
*  But back to the days of playing GoldenEye in the N64. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=152.0s)]
*  With your mates around on a sleepover. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=157.0s)]
*  Like Halo, just everyone in the same room. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=159.0s)]
*  Basically, yeah, having sleepovers in your mates' house. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=163.0s)]
*  That was like my highlight of my childhood. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=165.0s)]
*  So to now be getting to do that on the tour bus with all the boys is just the best feeling ever. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=168.0s)]
*  And sometimes a song will come on in the background where you're like, oh, sick, banger. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=175.0s)]
*  And occasionally they have a few rock songs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=180.0s)]
*  So like Fortnite, please just put us on the radio station. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=182.0s)]
*  When you're in the car and you're tuning to different stations and a tune comes on, that would be sick. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=186.0s)]
*  I think it would be great on The Last of Us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=191.0s)]
*  Yes. Oh, I can see that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=193.0s)]
*  I'm going to ruin this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=195.0s)]
*  I would love to be on the Dr. Mario soundtrack. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=197.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=202.0s)]
*  I think both would fit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=203.0s)]
*  Last of Us 3 should be coming out, so maybe we'll see you on that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=204.0s)]
*  And in terms of Mario, every year pretty much, innit? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=207.0s)]
*  Specifically Dr. Mario. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=209.0s)]
*  OK, we'll wait for that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=211.0s)]
*  It would have to be Grand Theft Auto. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=213.0s)]
*  The new Grand Theft Auto. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=215.0s)]
*  And we're trying. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=217.0s)]
*  We're trying. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=219.0s)]
*  The door has potentially been opened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=220.0s)]
*  So exclusive, exclusive for BBC. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=222.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=226.0s)]
*  Any we've been lucky in the past that kind of on our EP and our first album, we had some huge game collabs of like John Madden and Need for Speed and stuff like that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=227.0s)]
*  But today, what would I do? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=237.0s)]
*  I think it's got to be GTA, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=239.0s)]
*  I mean, that game is just like just massive. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=242.0s)]
*  So to get a song or do a collab with those guys on a platform that big would be wild. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=245.0s)]
*  I'd love to do that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=251.0s)]
*  One last thing I wanted to ask. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=252.0s)]
*  I noticed that you guys, I'm assuming you if you're running the socials, commented a sad face on the Tony Hawk playlist announcement. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=253.0s)]
*  So I just want to basically the fans are quite disappointed too. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=262.0s)]
*  And I just wanted to ask if there's anything you wanted to say about that, either to the fans or to Tony Hawk himself? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=265.0s)]
*  Tony. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=272.0s)]
*  Tony, listen, honestly, you know, the way that track wish took to that, we've gained like so many fans just from that game. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=273.0s)]
*  And we're we're simply proud of that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=288.0s)]
*  Is it a bummer that we weren't invited or they didn't include us? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=292.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=296.0s)]
*  We understand that they're trying to, you know, bring some new stuff on to these releases. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=299.0s)]
*  And if you got to make cuts, you got to make cuts. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=305.0s)]
*  I don't know why it had to be us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=308.0s)]
*  I feel like our song was really good on there and it did really well and it did really well for us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=310.0s)]
*  So, hey, that's cool. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=314.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=316.0s)]
*  We got a lot of fans out of it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=317.0s)]
*  So we're grateful for that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=318.0s)]
*  Super grateful. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=320.0s)]
*  And that's one of the, you know, more excited to be on that than to be on the radio or something. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=321.0s)]
*  You know, just it just felt right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=326.0s)]
*  You know, and but I kind of get it that that that skating kind of feels a little more like the punk side. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=328.0s)]
*  We're not a punk band. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=337.0s)]
*  We, you know, more like that work tour style. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=339.0s)]
*  We played the warp tour, but we were like, feel like maybe like a black sheep on that tour as far as different. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=341.0s)]
*  But I think that's what makes a cool collection of of a soundtrack is is being different. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=348.0s)]
*  But I could I could understand why, too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=354.0s)]
*  I feel like maybe it's more punk or something. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=356.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=358.0s)]
*  All I can do is just say, you know, thanks for the opportunity the first time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=364.0s)]
*  You know, because it's not like we didn't get something out of it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=365.0s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=368.0s)]
*  So I can get you on the next one. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=371.0s)]
*  If you want my final question, we don't want to be where we're not wanted. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=372.0s)]
*  Tony Hawk, 49 coming soon. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=377.0s)]
*  You [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyU7XAxXCBE&t=386.0s)]
