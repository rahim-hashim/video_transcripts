Video Description: Donald Trump said he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
 
In a message on his Truth Social site, US President Trump said that "for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders".
 
The reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," he said.
 
Leading Democrats said the proposal was "not a serious one".

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs)
*  US President Donald Trump has directed officials to rebuild and reopen the notorious Alcatraz prison [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=0.0s)]
*  on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=6.96s)]
*  The president says the jail will be used to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=10.8s)]
*  Well, he made the announcement on his Truth Social account starting with an all-capital statement, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=16.72s)]
*  rebuild and open Alcatraz. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=23.2s)]
*  He said he wanted the prison to be substantially enlarged before it was put back into service. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=26.08s)]
*  Alcatraz was shut down more than 60 years ago and turned into a museum. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=31.68s)]
*  Previous inmates included notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George Machine Gun Kelly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=37.44s)]
*  More than one and a half million people visited the tiny island every year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=46.08s)]
*  Let's talk to our North America correspondent, Norma Iqbal, who joins us now from Washington. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=51.68s)]
*  Norma, a huge visitor attraction. I've been there amongst millions of other people [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=56.56s)]
*  and I guess they'll be disappointed if it is turned back into a prison as Donald Trump's calling for. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=62.16s)]
*  How likely is that to happen, do you think? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=68.72s)]
*  I think it's largely unlikely. It's pretty impractical. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=72.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, when you say Alcatraz, people think of like all the movies that have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=76.39999999999999s)]
*  been made there, Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery, it was even in the Marvel movies and yeah, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=80.96s)]
*  I've been as well. It's like it's an amazing place to go and visit and you can see how isolated it is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=87.12s)]
*  in terms of, you know, off the coast of San Francisco. In terms of rebuilding it, well, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=93.44s)]
*  I mean, remember the reason it was closed was because it was so expensive. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=99.6s)]
*  And it would take it would cost so much money to to redo. We're talking about billions here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=104.48s)]
*  And, you know, it's in terms of like, if that would happen, it's probably not going to mean [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=112.4s)]
*  the Bureau of Prisons did release a statement just looking at it. They said, look, we will comply with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=119.2s)]
*  all presidential orders. I should mention that Donald Trump isn't the first president to suggest [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  potentially opening it. President Reagan considered it in 1981. But as I say, it's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=130.48s)]
*  just massively impractical. Nonetheless, Donald Trump wants to find somewhere to house what he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=136.56s)]
*  describes as the most dangerous and violent criminals and Alcatraz is what he's got on his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=142.72s)]
*  mind. But as I say, whether or not it will be open, I just think it's highly, highly unlikely, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=148.16s)]
*  highly impractical, but it makes for a very splashy headline. Yeah. And just briefly, I guess it would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  cost a lot in tourist revenue, wouldn't it? Because because of all those visitors, if it [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=158.64s)]
*  suddenly wasn't a tourist attraction anymore, that would cost what the state of California money? I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=162.88s)]
*  don't know who gets those funds. Yeah, it would. It would. It breaks it like 60 million dollars a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  year. Just look at the statistics and revenue. And as you mentioned, that tracks more than 1.6 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  million visitors a year. And so it would lose lots of money in that respect. I should also add, Ben, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=178.72s)]
*  over the weekend, President Trump gave an interview in which he basically said that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=186.96s)]
*  the US might be hit by a recession. He also suggested that American people should be less [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=191.36s)]
*  materialistic to try and deal with it. Lots of criticism over that interview. So there are some [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=195.68s)]
*  suggestions that saying that we should reopen Alcatraz is perhaps President Trump's way of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  slightly causing a distraction. Well, it'd be fascinating to see what happens with that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=208.4s)]
*  Nomiya, thank you very much indeed for bringing us up to date. Nomiya Rikveld, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=213.2s)]
*  there are North America correspondents. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTQ018dvWs&t=216.07999999999998s)]
