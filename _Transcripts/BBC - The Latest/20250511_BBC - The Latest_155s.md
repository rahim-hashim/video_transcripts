Video Description: A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to have held overnight into Sunday, after the two nations accused each other of "violations" just hours after a deal was reached.
 
Days of cross-border military strikes had preceded the US-brokered deal, marking the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades.
 
US President Donald Trump praised India and Pakistan's leaders for agreeing the ceasefire in fresh comments on Sunday morning, saying millions of people could have died without it.
 
This comes after explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir hours after the deal was announced, with both sides accusing each other of violations.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8)
*  A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding after some initial violations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=0.0s)]
*  which the two sides blamed on each other. Shops have begun reopening in Pakistan administered [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=4.88s)]
*  Kashmir, though many residents who fled the fighting remain hesitant about returning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=10.0s)]
*  This is the border town of Chakotty, which bore the brunt of recent cross-border shelling. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=15.32s)]
*  Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has said his country is committed to peace. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Our correspondent, Devina Gupta, has the latest from Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=26.08s)]
*  This morning it's been an uneasy calm in this area. We've also spoken to locals along the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=31.56s)]
*  line of control, the de facto border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Now, locals [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=37.66s)]
*  in Uri, one of the family members, told us there that he had spent the night in a bunker [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  with his family. He couldn't hear any shelling overnight and is now out, but his children [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=48.92s)]
*  are still in the bunker just going to show that how uneasy people are and his family [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=54.68s)]
*  also is about the ceasefire announcement for now. We also spoke to another family in Pooch, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=60.6s)]
*  which is trying to go back to their home. Pooch is one of the worst affected areas because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=67.0s)]
*  of intense shelling and cross-border firings where homes have been hit and lives have been [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=71.2s)]
*  lost. But there is a sense of cautiousness, if I can sum it up in that word, in this region, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  because people are still waiting to see how and for how long, in fact, this agreement [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=82.64s)]
*  holds. So all eyes are on those diplomatic talks tomorrow. This morning we've heard from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  India's capital city, Delhi, that India's prime minister has had a top-level meeting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=94.92s)]
*  with all the defence officials. We get to get to know more information around it. We're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=99.48s)]
*  also waiting for information whether schools and colleges will be open here in Srinagar, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=105.08s)]
*  where I'm at, which is again one of the most militarised zones in the world. We want to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=109.48s)]
*  see whether a civilian airspace again will be open for flights over here, which also [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  conveys a sense that things are coming back to quote unquote normal for people who've [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  been living under the shadow for conflict for decades here. Now, this time round, just [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=125.88s)]
*  last week, things came to such an escalation for the first time in decades that locals [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=131.4s)]
*  here could see drones in the sky. They could see drones being intercepted in India and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=137.36s)]
*  Pakistan came very close to the kind of conflict that hasn't been seen here in decades. And [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=141.88s)]
*  when I speak to people here, all they want is peace for now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzQ9MYA5g8&t=149.32s)]
