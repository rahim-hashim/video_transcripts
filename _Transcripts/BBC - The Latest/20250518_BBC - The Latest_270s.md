Video Description: Two people have been killed and at least 19 others injured after a tall Mexican Navy training sailboat crashed into New York City's Brooklyn Bridge, the city mayor has said.

Eric Adams said the Cuauhtémoc lost power before the collision on Saturday evening. US officials said 277 people were on board the vessel, which was on a goodwill visit.

Footage shows the Cuauhtémoc's towering masts clipping the bridge as the ship was passing under the famous structure on Saturday evening.

Crew members were standing on the masts at the time of collision, authorities said, which all snapped and fell to the deck.

*  I've been here for just over a couple of hours now and you can see the iconic [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=80.72s)]
*  Brooklyn Bridge behind me pretty dramatic scenes unfolded here just a few hours ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=86.0s)]
*  We believe it was just after sunset here on the East River that you can see behind me when this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=92.88s)]
*  incident happened the vessel supposed to be a Mexican Navy ship a Navy sail ship carrying 277 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=99.68s)]
*  Mexican cadets on board. Apparently this is a custom it happens at the end of training [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=110.24s)]
*  every year they were on a promotional tour. There are reports that the ship may have lost [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  power just before the collision and that may have caused the incident dramatic social videos that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=123.6s)]
*  social media videos that we've been seeing show us how it slowly went towards the bridge [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  in my background there and the masts grazed the very bottom of that bridge with some debris scene [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=138.96s)]
*  falling off and this was this was happening at a time when the bridge was busy with traffic there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=147.68s)]
*  was traffic going both ways it's a multi-lane bridge there's also a subway that goes there [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=154.0s)]
*  but then in the aftermath of course it was all shut down and New Yorkers were told to avoid the area. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=161.68s)]
*  What do you know about those who've been killed and injured? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=169.2s)]
*  Very scant details emerging as of now all that we have heard from the Mayor is that nobody [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  seems to have fallen into the water and there were a couple of cadets reportedly on the mast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=181.28s)]
*  We still don't have clarity who are the deceased how did this happen and how did they receive their [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=190.0s)]
*  very serious injuries but earlier the Mayor did say that four were seriously injured. We will [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=197.52s)]
*  discover soon whether the two of the deceased are among those who were seriously injured. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And it seems from the pictures we're seeing that quite a lot of people were watching as this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=209.68s)]
*  accident happened. That's right because remember Brooklyn Bridge is a New York City tourist [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  hotspot it's famous it's on every tourist guide every tourist book the tourists that who come here [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=221.44s)]
*  also like straddle it up and down they walk the bridge to see panoramic views of the skyline of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=228.64s)]
*  the New York City. Very beautiful sunsets and sunrises can be seen here. Brooklyn Bridge itself [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=235.44s)]
*  a very old bridge it's been here since the 1800s and is quite majestic looking as you can see. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=245.28s)]
*  So of course there were people here who were watching this unfold as it happened [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  and when the ship seems to have lost slight control it veered towards the shore where people [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=258.32s)]
*  were standing and watching and you can see them running from the scene after that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392JUMCBSQY&t=264.64s)]
