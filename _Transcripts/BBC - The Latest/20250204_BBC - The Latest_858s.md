Video Description: China has announced retaliatory tariffs on some American goods, as US tariffs on all Chinese goods come into force.

The Chinese tariffs - due to begin on Monday - would put a 15% import tax on US coal and liquefied natural gas, plus 10% on crude oil, agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.

Proposed US tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican goods have been postponed after last-minute talks.

President Trump says the Chinese tariffs are a response to trade deficits, and the flow of fentanyl into the US.

# China announces retaliatory action as Donald Trump's tariffs take effect | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE)
*  So we begin with the breaking news. A fresh trade war between the US and China has just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=0.0s)]
*  kicked off. An hour and a half ago, the US went ahead with its promise of 10% tariffs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=7.44s)]
*  on all Chinese goods headed to the US. China quickly responded and announced it's to do the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=13.44s)]
*  same in a tit-for-tat spat that could impact the global economy. China's finance ministry is saying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=19.92s)]
*  the measures against US goods would take effect next Monday. An extra 10% tax will be added to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=26.72s)]
*  goods including crude oil and agricultural machinery. Imports of coal and liquefied natural gas will be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=34.24s)]
*  hit with 15% tariffs. It's also saying it's filing a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=41.12s)]
*  the action from the US. In Asia, stock markets were riding high earlier today with Hong Kong's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=48.72s)]
*  opening up over 3% higher than the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was up more than 1.5%. But since the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  announcement of new tariffs in the US and China, the markets are now muted. On Wall Street, heavy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=63.44s)]
*  losses were clawed back on Monday as the news broke that 25% tariffs on Mexico are to be delayed for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=71.52s)]
*  a month. Hours later, a similar deal was announced with Canada after President Trump spoke to Canada's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=78.32s)]
*  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canada agreed to ensure further security at its border. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=85.04s)]
*  On North America, business correspondent Michelle Fleury is in the town of Windsor, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=92.56s)]
*  Ontario in Canada. It's right by the US border where she's been getting reaction to all these [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=97.04s)]
*  latest developments. In response to the threat of tariffs, some Canadian liquor stores had pulled [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=102.4s)]
*  US brands from their shelves. Tonight, they are being restocked, the trade war averted for now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=109.12s)]
*  But for some, the break may be permanent. For me, a line's been crossed. Monica Morelli cancelled [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=115.76s)]
*  subscriptions to Amazon and Netflix, two American companies, because of Trump's trade threats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=122.72s)]
*  She isn't planning to sign back up. It's like the whims of someone who changes from day to day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=128.4s)]
*  It's not acceptable. And for me, like, I think it's broken something. I can't trust the US to be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=134.4s)]
*  the ally anymore. At Laval, they make parts used in other goods. They were bracing for the worst. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=140.8s)]
*  Around 80% of Canada's exports end up in America. Even with the delay, Laval President Jonathan [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=148.24s)]
*  Azzapardi said questions remain. The uncertainty is as bad as the tariffs. This company has been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=154.96s)]
*  a business for over 50 years. That 50 years of success came from both sides working together, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=160.72s)]
*  creating relationships that took a very long time to create. And now knowing that that relationship [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=167.36s)]
*  was as fragile as it is, and that one person's agenda can change that whole relationship and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=172.96s)]
*  change the course of a business that's been around for half a century, hurts a lot. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=178.88s)]
*  Here in Windsor, Ontario, you can see the American city of Detroit just across the river. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=184.4s)]
*  Tonight, the feeling of betrayal by a neighbour replaced by a sense of relief. But for how long? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=190.16s)]
*  Michelle Flurry, BBC News, Windsor, Ontario. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=197.44s)]
*  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted he had a good call with President Trump and will [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  be implementing a $1.3 billion plan, reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=207.52s)]
*  personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners and increased resources to stop the flow [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=214.32s)]
*  of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=220.4s)]
*  Trudeau also said Canada would appoint a fentanyl czar, list cartels as terrorists and launch a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=227.76s)]
*  Canada-US Joint Strike Force to combat organised crime, fentanyl and money laundering. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=234.16s)]
*  Moshe Landa is senior lecturer of economics at Concordia University. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=240.96s)]
*  I asked him if Justin Trudeau has done enough to keep the threat of tariffs at bay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=245.84s)]
*  Probably. When Trump was elected, he had texted out that the tariffs were coming unless Canada [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=251.92s)]
*  controlled fentanyl and immigrants crossing the northern border into the US. I'm not entirely sure [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=259.76s)]
*  how big a problem those two things are or whether they're more imagined in Trump's mind. But given [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=266.4s)]
*  that there's now going to be much more enhanced border security to try and stop whatever fentanyl [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=273.44s)]
*  and immigrants are crossing, that was the precondition to make the tariffs go away. So [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=278.4s)]
*  we don't know in 30 days whether he's going to ask for something else or that's going to be the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=282.96s)]
*  opening part of the negotiation. But allegedly what Trudeau offered today was what he wanted. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=287.52s)]
*  In the meantime, Moshe, what are you hearing about how people are positioning themselves [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=294.56s)]
*  in the light of this potential conflict? Consumers are upset. They've started boycotts. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=298.72s)]
*  I'm not sure how long the boycotts are going to last or how much they realise does in fact come [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=304.56s)]
*  from the US. But consumers don't like the thought. And Canadians have a reputation for being kind, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=308.56s)]
*  hard and generous people. But we can also be extremely proud and defensive when our country [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=314.32s)]
*  is under threat. Businesses of course are very concerned too. A lot of our natural resource-based [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=319.6s)]
*  industry is powering the US literally and figuratively. And so there have been threats [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  that will turn out the lights in the US if they want to terrify us. I don't think that that's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=331.36s)]
*  exactly the best strategy. But that just shows the degree to which Canadians are upset that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  one man, as you played in an earlier clip, has the capacity to really wreck the Canadian economy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=341.12s)]
*  So that's the situation in Canada. But what about China, where 10% tariffs have just been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=347.44s)]
*  applied to Chinese exports to the US and China has just announced its following suit with a raft [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  of tariffs to be applied to American goods? Dr. Harry Broadman is a trade expert with Rand [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=359.68s)]
*  Corporation and told me this is just the beginning. It's just the latest chapter in our relationship [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=365.04s)]
*  with China, I think really epitomized by how Trump sees China as a mano-a-mano bargaining situation, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=371.76s)]
*  just like, frankly, he did with Canada and Mexico. And China is very smart. They've picked US exports [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=380.0s)]
*  that are very sensitive to US firms. And you can be sure that those firms are giving an earful [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=387.36s)]
*  to Mr. Trump right now. Yeah, it'd be interesting to see how this plays out. President Trump is [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  saying he's going to speak to President Xi later this week. He had phone calls with Claudia [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=400.4s)]
*  Scheinbaum yesterday and Justin Trudeau of Canada. That seemed to lead to a good result. Could we see [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  the same for China? Sure. And I believe that Xi is expecting that because now the cat is out of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  bag that this is how Trump wants to use tariffs as the beginning, perhaps, of a discussion. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=420.32s)]
*  It's quite extraordinary. If you're in a real serious trade war, you're not expecting to then [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=426.88s)]
*  get on the phone with the head of state just after you've imposed something. So I think this [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  is quite orchestrated by the way that Trump sees the world and what he wants to use as a bargaining [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=437.52s)]
*  chip. And what's also extraordinary is some of the items that are coming up in the trade war are not [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  necessarily economic merchandise items, but other things like the border. And so it's as if that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=451.36s)]
*  Trump sees tariffs as his only tool in the toolkit to try to change our policy with respect to other [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  countries. With Canada and Mexico, some might argue it was quite simple to promise to President [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=465.76s)]
*  Trump what he wanted, i.e. much more security at the border, many more measures to prevent fentanyl [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=473.04s)]
*  crossing across, et cetera, et cetera. With China, it's not so simple, is it? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=481.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. I mean, our supply chains, as everyone knows, with China are quite sophisticated [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=486.0s)]
*  and quite complex in terms of both up and down the supply chain. So I think this is not just a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=494.24s)]
*  question of fixing a border or dealing with a drug problem. Not that those are insignificant, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  but you have a network of factories and supply chain, ships, trucks, consumers, workers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=506.96s)]
*  Everybody is affected when you have the two largest economies of the world beginning a trade war. Now, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  whether this trade war actually turns out to be a trade war, and she and Trump speak on the phone, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  which was already planned, who knows? Maybe in the next day or two, she will say something that will [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=525.92s)]
*  satisfy Trump. I don't think so, but I think that's the theatrics that is going on in the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=532.24s)]
*  background here. And it really undercuts, I think, Trump's strategy to try to be a strong man [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=536.88s)]
*  relative to other countries around the world using tariffs. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=542.96s)]
*  Dr. Harry Broadman there, who was a former US Assistant Trade Representative and Chief of Staff [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=547.28s)]
*  in the US's US President's Council of Economic Advisers. So interesting to get his take on things. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=553.84s)]
*  Let's now get an expert view on the market reaction. So it's proving to be another roller [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=559.76s)]
*  coaster ride for traders today. As I mentioned earlier, in Asia, shares in Hong Kong were [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=564.16s)]
*  rallying. They opened up over 3%. That was also the case in Japan and other markets in Asia. But [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=570.16s)]
*  now investors are wary again with the trade spat between the US and China gathering speed. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=577.28s)]
*  Russ Mould is investment director at AJ Bell and shared with me his view. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=583.68s)]
*  Interesting to see that those rallies we saw in Asia this morning didn't get back all of the ground [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=588.56s)]
*  they lost yesterday, because there's still the 30-day option for Trump to bring tariffs back on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=592.96s)]
*  Canada and Mexico. There were the new tariffs on China which have now come in and there were the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=597.76s)]
*  old ones which are still there and there's still a source of conflict between the two. And now we [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=601.76s)]
*  have the additional complication of China raising the stakes. Now we'll see what comes out of those [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=606.48s)]
*  talks. Reluctantly looking at President Trump's ex-feed, and he seems to be linking a trade deal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=611.04s)]
*  with China to what happens with TikTok in particular. Well, I was just going to say, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=616.4s)]
*  actually, it's really interesting in Hong Kong. The big winners today are all the tech stocks. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=620.0s)]
*  There's conversations about the future of TikTok is likely to be revealed soon, that negotiations [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=624.4s)]
*  are ongoing. As I said to Harry Broadman, it's such a complicated relationship, isn't it, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=631.28s)]
*  between the US and China on so many levels? Yeah, the customs duties that America generates [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=638.48s)]
*  overall are now more than double where they were eight years ago when President Trump introduced [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=644.32s)]
*  his first tariffs on Chinese goods such as washing machines, steel and aluminium. And the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Biden administration didn't remove those and it actually added to them. So the tensions have been [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=653.36s)]
*  going on now for eight years and they haven't come down. Technology, national security, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=658.0s)]
*  intellectual property are all very, very hot issues between the two nations. And whether [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  one phone call can resolve them or not is difficult to tell, but it seems unlikely. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=668.8800000000001s)]
*  It will be interesting to see what happens after the conversation between President Trump [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=674.32s)]
*  and President Xi, which we're told will happen sometime this week. But from China's perspective, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=678.0s)]
*  its economy is in a tough spot, has been really since the pandemic. The growth is not kicking in. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  There's all sorts of issues impacting the Chinese economy. This couldn't come at a worst time, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=690.32s)]
*  could it? No, you can argue from President Trump's perspective, his arguments therefore [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  are the ideal time to have it in that China's economy, as you say, is struggling. It's coming [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=699.44s)]
*  out of a real estate bust. Its infrastructure and domestic spending model is struggling to take up [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoBPgnXtXE&t=704.24s)]
