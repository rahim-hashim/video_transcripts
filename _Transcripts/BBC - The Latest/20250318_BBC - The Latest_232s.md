Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has resumed combat with "full force" after deadly Gaza strikes, adding "this is just the beginning‚Äù.

The Hamas-run health ministry say the strikes killed more than 400 people.
 
Netanyahu also says he remains committed to securing the release of all hostages still in Gaza - Israel believe there are 59 people being held, with 24 thought to be alive. A group representing hostages' families has accused the Israeli government of choosing "to give up the hostages" by launching new strikes.

Hamas accused Israel of attacking "defenceless civilians" and said mediators should hold Israel responsible for "violating and overturning" their deal

*  Jon Donison watched today's events unfold from Starrot near the Israeli Gaza border, and a warning his report contains distressing images. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=83.0s)]
*  The worst thing that can happen is the horror. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=106.0s)]
*  He'll be lucky if he gets out alive. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=111.0s)]
*  Today was one of the deadliest days of the last 18 months. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=117.0s)]
*  The Strip's crippled healthcare system and hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=122.0s)]

*  At least 174 children were killed, according to the Ministry of Health, which operates under Hamas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=133.0s)]

*  I'm sure he will die. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=154.0s)]
*  And with the number killed today over 400 and climbing, many are already saying their last goodbyes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=157.0s)]
*  In Israel, in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, the news terrified some of the families of those still being held by Hamas, among them twins Gali and Ziv Berman. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=166.0s)]
*  Israel government is not perfect and clearly is not doing enough because my brothers are not home. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=177.0s)]
*  But if Hamas wanted, the hostages will be back. They are in their hands. They are right now in Gaza, not in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=183.0s)]
*  We will show no mercy on our enemies. Let me be very clear. Israel will not stop until all of our hostages are back home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=190.0s)]
*  With Gaza already in ruins, it's the most vulnerable who are suffering the most. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=202.0s)]
*  But after a year and a half of war, the Israeli government is sticking to its belief that Hamas only responds to force. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=208.0s)]
*  It thinks military pressure will win it concessions if negotiations resume. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=216.0s)]
*  But with hundreds more now dead, the optimists are few and far between. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=221.0s)]
*  John Donnison, BBC News, on the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkWX5RcfKk&t=227.0s)]
