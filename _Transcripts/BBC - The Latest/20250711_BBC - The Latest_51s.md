**BBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8)
*  President Trump will be surveying the damage here in Kerr County and meeting local responders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=0.0s)]
*  He arrives in the state of Texas, which has consistently supported him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=5.04s)]
*  That is probably why he's not very critical of the Republican governor here, Greg Abbott, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=8.72s)]
*  unlike the way he was critical of the Democratic governor Gavin Newsom [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=13.84s)]
*  following those wildfires in California. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=17.28s)]
*  But there are lots of questions growing for President Trump in terms of how the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=19.92s)]
*  government has responded to the flooding. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Mr Trump has long wanted to axe FEMA, the agency that responds to disasters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  But there are now reports that he is planning to move away from that plan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=32.56s)]
*  Presidents are often defined by the way they handle natural disasters like this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And so it may be that the president sensing the mood here is once again shifting the goalposts [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=42.48s)]
*  in order to fit the occasion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0gchBzWj8&t=48.96s)]
