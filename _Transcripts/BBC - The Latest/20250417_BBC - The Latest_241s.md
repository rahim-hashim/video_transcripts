Video Description: As China and the US face off over tariffs, China is also facing another economic problem - an ageing population.
 
But, if the country’s retirees - with potentially decades of savings - buy more goods, Chinese companies won't have to rely as much on trade overseas.
 
To facilitate this, Beijing has introduced initiatives like “silver trains” - trains taking OAPs to tourist spots in the country, and encouraging them to spend there.

# Aboard China’s ‘silver trains’ taking pensioners to tourist spots to offset tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o)
*  As China and the US face off over tariffs, the Chinese government is facing another economic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=0.0s)]
*  problem, an ageing population. Beijing is hoping to encourage pensioners to start spending [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=5.36s)]
*  by putting them on special so-called silver trains to take them to areas which have seen [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=11.16s)]
*  a decline in tourism. Let's hear more about it from our China correspondent Stephen McDonnell. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=15.92s)]
*  Stephen tell us more. Beijing's been standing firm in the face of these huge tariffs from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=21.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, but it has had to acknowledge that there will be some pain for the Chinese [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=29.68s)]
*  economy as a result of these charges. So, one option for policy makers has been to try [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=33.76s)]
*  to increase domestic consumption to make up for some of the lost export revenue. And a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=39.0s)]
*  key target group in achieving this has been retirees. After all, they've got their savings [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=44.36s)]
*  and sometimes just need a chance to spend some of this money. So we're here at Beijing's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=50.16s)]
*  train station, from this train station, like from train stations all across the country [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=54.48s)]
*  now. There are these special silver trains designed to take the older generations to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=59.04s)]
*  places where they can spend up for the good of the country and we went along for a ride [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=64.28s)]
*  on one of them. These party animals are being asked to head out and have a good time for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=69.32s)]
*  the sake of China's economic future. We have been working so hard for many years, so I'm [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=76.32s)]
*  66 years old. So important thing is that when we reach this year, this age, we must know [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=85.32s)]
*  what is the right thing to do and must really enjoy our life. This country is rolling out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=92.32s)]
*  fleets of so-called silver trains, named this way because of the hair colour of the passengers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=97.72s)]
*  We're shown the extra safety features. Here we have 24-hour support. We also have a virtual [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=106.32s)]
*  assistant. In the bathroom, an emergency button and on board there are defibrillators and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  emergency kits. Morning comes and time for breakfast before the next stop. And it's the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  less developed destinations along the route which need a shot in the arm. So the travellers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  of years gone by are back. When I was young, I really liked exploring the world. I was always [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=141.72s)]
*  in the countryside. Now I'm older. I have my family who can go with me. On this occasion, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=148.72s)]
*  her granddaughter has come along too. These trips alone are not going to fix China's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=165.44s)]
*  problem with low consumer spending. Yet economists would say at least it's a step in the right [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=172.44s)]
*  direction. So heading back to the train, the silver adventurers can crash out knowing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=177.92s)]
*  that their big day out was at least partly for the benefit of all. Then it's on to the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=186.72s)]
*  next town. Stephen McDonnell, BBC News, Yunnan Province. These silver trains are only one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=194.0s)]
*  attempt to tap into the so-called silver economy. Apart from holidays, retirees are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=201.0s)]
*  looking for places to settle down. They might even want to buy some things for their kids [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=205.6s)]
*  and grandkids. The problem of course is getting Chinese consumers to spend up at a time of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=209.6s)]
*  economic uncertainty. And this uncertainty already existed with a property crisis, with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=215.24s)]
*  youth unemployment. Then you're adding into the mix Donald Trump's tariffs. However, as [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=221.24s)]
*  I said in the package, economists would say because of this environment, any attempt at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=225.84s)]
*  all to try to get people to spend some more right now is a good idea. Stephen, thank you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=230.48s)]
*  very much. Stephen McDonnell. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK29Ogguj7o&t=236.48000000000002s)]
