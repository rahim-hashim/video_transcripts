Video Description: A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, in a major blow to a key component of his economic policies.
 
Three judges ruled that the US president overstepped his authority when he used an emergency law to impose tariffs on nearly every country.
 
Moments after the ruling, the Trump administration said it would appeal.
 
Meanwhile, Elon Musk has said he is leaving the Trump administration after helping lead the Department of Government Efficiency, known as Doge. Thousands of federal jobs were axed as a result of Doge.

# US trade court blocks Trump's sweeping tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s)
*  A US federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=0.0s)]
*  imposing global tariffs. If it holds, the block would represent a major blow to a key [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=6.28s)]
*  part of Mr Trump's economic policies. Well, the court sided with lawyers representing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=11.66s)]
*  small US businesses who argued that President Trump overstepped his authority by taxing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=17.04s)]
*  imports. Within minutes of the ruling, the Trump administration lodged an appeal. A White [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=22.38s)]
*  House spokesman said it was not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=27.88s)]
*  national emergency. With us is our business correspondent, Mark Lobel. Talk to us more, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=33.32s)]
*  Mark, about what's actually happened here. Well, in the last few hours, this federal [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=38.8s)]
*  court has blunted one of Donald Trump's key economic weapons that he wanted to use to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=41.84s)]
*  boost US manufacturing and to protect jobs. Now, if you cast your mind back to Liberation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=46.72s)]
*  Day as Donald Trump called it on April the 2nd when he was standing up in the White House [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=52.16s)]
*  garden with that board with all those numbers on, all those reciprocal tariffs, that global [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=55.08s)]
*  import tax that he put on most countries around the world, and also country-specific ones [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  like the big ones on China and the EU that have been jumping around like a kid on a pogo [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=66.3s)]
*  stick has been sending global markets into disarray. And now we've suddenly had this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=71.58s)]
*  news excluding the tariffs on steel and aluminium and also on cars, everything else will be [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=77.28s)]
*  suspended in 10 days' time unless Donald Trump and his team can find a way to stop them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=85.3s)]
*  You mentioned the markets. How have they reacted? Well, huge relief for the markets. They're [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=91.42s)]
*  up in Asia. US futures are up and the FTSE 100 has just opened up 0.5% up. The Nikkei [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=95.86s)]
*  225 was up 1.9%. Hong Kong Hang Seng was up 1.1%. Also in South Korea, it was up 1.8% [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  significant because they had already been on a rally. So, stock markets have been going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=109.34s)]
*  up in recent days anyway. So, this is definitely as a result of this news. The dollar has been [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=114.9s)]
*  strengthening too against other safe haven currencies. So, there's relief there, but [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  big questions now about the trading partners and the businesses that would have been at [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=123.66s)]
*  the end of these tariffs. So, for example, the ASEAN summit earlier this week, there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=128.5s)]
*  were all these manoeuvrings. China had gone to visit the summit to decide how to deal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  with this big problem and they were going to create new strategic partnerships. The [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=136.7s)]
*  UK, for example, although it had a deal with President Trump, that was just about the aluminium [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=142.1s)]
*  and steel sectors and the car sectors, which remain anyway. So, that's a helpful deal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=146.66s)]
*  But the UK was still subject to 10% tax on most of its goods, plus businesses. Businesses [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  have been waiting to work out what to do about investments. I'm not sure this brings them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  enough clarity yet, but they would certainly prefer a world without these tariffs. This [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=160.7s)]
*  case against the Trump administration, ironically, was brought by small businesses that were [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=166.9s)]
*  supposed to benefit from his policy. That's right. Importers of things like wine and bikes [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=171.94s)]
*  in America. They went to the federal courts just saying that he had overstepped the mark, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=178.34s)]
*  that they had concentrated more on policy rather than legality. And that's what the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=182.94s)]
*  court agreed. They agreed that while Congress could have passed these types of laws, the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=186.46s)]
*  president himself didn't have that power in the way that he'd brought it forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=192.18s)]
*  Mark, for the moment, thank you very much. Mark LeBell. Let's speak to Dr Rebecca Harding, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=196.34s)]
*  chief executive of the new Centre for Economic Security, an organisation that researches [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=202.02s)]
*  the nature of economic threats. Dr Harding, welcome. Thank you for joining us here on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=207.1s)]
*  BBC News. How much of a setback do you believe this is for Donald Trump? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  So I think what we're going to see is a huge constitutional battle now. So it's going to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=216.46s)]
*  turn into a domestic battle. It is a setback. There's absolutely no question about that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=221.38s)]
*  But he has other tools in his armoury, and I don't want to give the administration ideas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=225.98s)]
*  But the idea at the moment might be that they'd use the Section 232 of the Trade Expansion [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=232.54s)]
*  Act, which is what they've got the iron and steel tariffs under at the moment. So that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  act allows them to say on national security grounds, these sectors are able to have tariffs [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=244.18s)]
*  imposed on them. So what he might decide to do is go down a sexual road rather than a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=250.34s)]
*  country road. So it is a setback. It will create a conflict within the constitution [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=255.54s)]
*  because it's now, as President Trump has said, unelected judges against an elected president. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=262.26s)]
*  It's not a good place to be because that type of constitutional uncertainty still means [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=270.1s)]
*  that America is a very uncertain place. Where does it leave then the multiple trade [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=275.06s)]
*  talks that are underway? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  So I think the main thing that's happened here is that since President Trump came to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=282.72s)]
*  power and since Liberation Day in particular, the world has been dealing with this seismic [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  shock, which is the extent to which President Trump is breaking the world trade system. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=293.04s)]
*  So the trust has disappeared. So countries are now saying we need to be more self-sufficient. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=298.36s)]
*  We can get whatever deals we can. Europe has kind of been very slow and gradual to move [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  into those types of trade agreements and has in a way almost been playing who blinks [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=309.2s)]
*  first with the American administration. So I think that trust has gone and now everybody [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=315.12s)]
*  needs to step back and go, maybe America needs to fight its own constitutional battles first. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=320.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, we need to build our own self-sufficiency. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=326.48s)]
*  Where does it leave countries like the UK that have actually come up with a deal with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=329.24s)]
*  the United States? I mean, is there any sort of mileage in them thinking, well, we needn't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  be bothered? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=336.96s)]
*  I think, well, I mean, the news this morning is obviously that the administration in the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  UK are trying to continue and accelerate those conversations with the United States [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=344.88s)]
*  because they do affect the sectoral level tariffs on cars and on iron and steel. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=349.52s)]
*  So, I mean, the deal is fairly flimsy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=355.2s)]
*  It hasn't been ratified yet. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=358.12s)]
*  I do think that there is there is some mileage in keeping those conversations going, but [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=360.52s)]
*  rushing to the table too quickly when there's so much uncertainty around is a risky thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=365.28s)]
*  President Trump's team have said they're going to break things. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=371.08s)]
*  They weren't joking. And this is very, very, very difficult for small businesses. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  So the government needs to think about how to create a stable platform for the small [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=378.88s)]
*  business sector exporting to the United States. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=383.28s)]
*  I mean, how long might this Tobidits go on for? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=385.88s)]
*  Because legal battles can take months or even years. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=387.88s)]
*  So, Lee, you're absolutely right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=391.36s)]
*  And I think I think this is the new normal. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=393.44s)]
*  Uncertainty is the new normal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=395.92s)]
*  This is where we are at. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think we can predict how long it's going to take because, you know, we've [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=399.72s)]
*  had Liberation Day and then we've had not Liberation Day. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=403.88s)]
*  We've had the reciprocal tariffs suspended. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  And now we're in this situation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=410.04s)]
*  It is just the case that we are going to see masses of uncertainty in the global economic [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  system. And it makes it very hard for a small business or a big business, actually, to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=418.0s)]
*  decide what they're going to do and formulate strategies while they don't really know [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=422.48s)]
*  what the world one of the world's largest trading nation, well, second largest trading [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=427.68s)]
*  nation after China, well, it doesn't know what what what that nation is going to do. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=432.12s)]
*  So it's very difficult for small businesses and large businesses to make long term [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=437.28s)]
*  decisions. And we just don't know. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=442.0s)]
*  So we have to deal with that uncertainty and we have to think about what our exposures [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=444.64s)]
*  are and how we're going to manage that uncertainty in the future. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=448.68s)]
*  Dr. Rebecca Harding, CEO of the Center for Economic Security. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=452.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=455.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk is leaving his position within President Trump's cost cutting task [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=458.72s)]
*  force, the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=463.36s)]
*  He said his scheduled time as a special government employee had come to an end and he [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=467.0s)]
*  thanked Mr. Trump for the opportunity. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=471.32s)]
*  Our North American correspondent, Jake Kwan, is in Washington with the latest developments. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=473.44s)]
*  The billionaire Elon Musk scheduled time as a special government employee had come to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  an end. And this departure has been anticipated for a while because [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=483.76s)]
*  the special government employee are up to allowed up to 130 days in the government [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=489.12s)]
*  and his 130 days is up around this week. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  But this departure still feels somewhat abrupt and unceremonious. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk has taken to social media platform X to announce his departure and the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=501.84s)]
*  White House quietly confirmed that they are off boarding him today. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=507.0s)]
*  And this this departure comes off the back of Elon Musk's interview where he [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=512.32s)]
*  criticized President Trump's marquee spending bill, which had added billions in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=518.4s)]
*  deficits as it continued his tax cuts and added more spending of the defense budget. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=525.24s)]
*  And as somebody whose whole job in the government was to cut the deficit, Elon Musk [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=531.2s)]
*  said that this bill is undermining his work. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=536.44s)]
*  And while Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, their relationship seems quite solid, Elon Musk's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=539.72s)]
*  and other officials in the White House, their relationship has been contentious, according [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  to reports. And Mr. Musk's other business ventures like the Tesla, their [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=551.64s)]
*  business has been suffering since he went into the politics for a while. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  The sales have dried up as his traditional customer base had come to really hate his [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  political activity and his views. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTkErt0n9s&t=569.5600000000001s)]
