Video Description: South Korea's constitutional court has unanimously voted to uphold the impeachment of president Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law last December, which plunged the country into political turmoil.

Yoon's powers were first suspended when parliament voted to impeach him on 14 December.

Now that the impeachment is finalised, a snap election must be held in the country within 60 days.

Meanwhile, Yoon also faces a separate charge of insurrection which will go on trial at a later date.

# South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol removed from office over martial law order | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o)
*  We start in South Korea where the Constitutional Court has upheld the impeachment of President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=0.0s)]
*  Young Suk-yeol. The decision means he's been removed from office and elections will be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=5.92s)]
*  held within 60 days. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  The judges unanimously found Mr. Yoon's short-lived attempt to impose martial law last year violated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  the constitution. The declaration in December sparked chaos before it was overturned by [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=21.06s)]
*  parliament and Mr. Yoon was impeached. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=26.56s)]
*  These were the scenes on the streets of Seoul as critics of Mr. Yoon celebrated when they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  heard the decision. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=42.0s)]
*  How did his presidency end up in disgrace? On December 3rd last year, President Yoon [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=44.68s)]
*  declared martial law in a televised address. The next day, lawmakers voted to rescind Mr. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=51.6s)]
*  Yoon's order and martial law was lifted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  On December 7th, Mr. Yoon survived the first impeachment vote but a week later he was then [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=64.16s)]
*  impeached by parliament. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Then on December 31st, a district court issued a warrant to detain Mr. Yoon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=74.64s)]
*  Two weeks later, the Constitutional Court held its first formal hearing into the case. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=81.2s)]
*  The following day, Mr. Yoon was arrested after a weeks-long standoff. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=87.36s)]
*  Then, earlier this week, on April 1st, the Constitutional Court said it would announce [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=92.12s)]
*  its decision to uphold Mr. Yoon's impeachment today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=97.7s)]
*  Our chief presenter, Steve Lai, is outside the court in Seoul. Steve? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=103.44s)]
*  Hi, Tai. It's been a remarkable day here in South Korea. You can't underestimate how [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=111.2s)]
*  big a deal this is for the president's impeachment ruling to be upheld. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=115.04s)]
*  That verdict came in just over two hours ago when the eight justices all sat in the building [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=119.72s)]
*  just behind me and decided unanimously to uphold that impeachment charge. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=125.04s)]
*  When that moment happened, when they announced that, there was loud cheers that we could [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=132.0s)]
*  hear. Even though there is a 150-meter cordon around where I am at the Constitutional Court, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=137.08s)]
*  I could still hear where the protests were being carried out. I could still hear a loud [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=142.0s)]
*  cheer erupt from all those that wanted this impeachment to be upheld, that wanted President [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=146.16s)]
*  Yoon to be taken out of office. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=153.16s)]
*  And there is a celebratory mood amongst those supporters of that decision to impeach President [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=155.52s)]
*  Yoon that we were showing earlier. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=161.16s)]
*  There are, of course, those pro-Yoon supporters that wanted to see the impeachment overturned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=162.8s)]
*  There's a whole line of flowers dedicated to President Yoon just to my left lining up [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=168.16s)]
*  the wall of the Constitutional Court, all saying President Yoon does not deserve to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=171.76s)]
*  be impeached, saying that President Yoon should remain as president. But for those supporters, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=175.88s)]
*  they have been left dejected and deflated by this Constitutional Court's ruling. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=181.04s)]
*  Now, there had been a significant police presence here in Seoul, and there still is. Fourteen [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=186.68s)]
*  thousand police were mobilized to make sure that whatever the verdict was going to be, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  that there wasn't going to be any disruption, there wasn't going to be any violence. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=195.96s)]
*  And the concerns were real, because back in 2017, when Park Geun-hye was impeached, it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=200.76s)]
*  did result in some violence. Some protesters then, four of them, died in scuffles with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=204.96s)]
*  So the prospect of potential violence was real, and it still could be. We still haven't [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=211.48s)]
*  seen things all play out here today. This ruling only came in two hours ago. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=218.0s)]
*  Mr. Yoon was stripped of his duties, as you alluded to, Tyg, there, running through the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=222.32s)]
*  timeline of how this all happened. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, the pressure in South Korea had been ramped up with the time that had passed since [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  the last hearing by the Constitutional Court, up until the decision. It was about 38 days. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=234.24s)]
*  Now, when Park Geun-hye was impeached back in 2017, that time was only 11 or so days. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=238.84s)]
*  So the further this got stretched out and drawn out, it really did sort of amplify the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=243.2s)]
*  stakes and the tension here in South Korea. But that tension has now been broken by this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=248.12s)]
*  decision by the Constitutional Court. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=252.92s)]
*  And our Seoul correspondent, Jean Mackenzie, takes a look back at how we got here and what [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=255.12s)]
*  happens next. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=260.48s)]
*  A night that stunned the country and the world. Troops stormed South Korea's parliament as [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=262.36s)]
*  the president ordered a military takeover. This evoked ghosts of Korea's violent authoritarian [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  past. The people and politicians resisted, forcing Mr. Yoon to retract martial law just [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=281.32s)]
*  six hours later. In the days that followed, hundreds of thousands took to the streets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=289.48s)]
*  until parliament voted to suspend him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=297.12s)]
*  Today the courts have upheld that decision. After months of deliberation, Mr. Yoon has [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=302.6s)]
*  been permanently removed from office. This was a desperate gamble by a deeply unpopular [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=307.64s)]
*  candidate. Once a successful prosecutor from a well-off family, Mr. Yoon proved to be an [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=315.96s)]
*  ineffective politician. He clashed with his powerful opposition party, accusing them of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=321.88s)]
*  paralyzing the country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=327.96s)]
*  John Linton is a conservative politician who's close to the president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=332.28s)]
*  In his toolbox he saw this martial law as a method for punishing the opposition. From [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=336.56s)]
*  logically or reasonably speaking, it was a poor decision. It lacked wisdom. And he is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  paying the consequences for it now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=349.16s)]
*  Mr. Yoon is also facing life in prison. He's been charged with insurrection in a separate [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  ongoing criminal case. Last month he was released from detention ahead of his trial to the delight [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  of his loyal supporters. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  As this crisis has dragged on, these crowds have become more agitated and extreme. Buying [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=371.0s)]
*  into far-right conspiracy theories, the president himself has dangled. Today's impeachment is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=377.76s)]
*  not what they were hoping for. And South Korea, more polarised than ever, is now bracing itself [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=386.02s)]
*  for unrest. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  G Mackenzie, BBC News, Seoul. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=393.84s)]
*  I was talking earlier about Yoon supporters and how they might react. I've just seen on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=395.96s)]
*  our live page Yoon supporter has been arrested for damaging a police bus window not too far [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=402.84s)]
*  from the Constitutional Court. Now that happened earlier. That's one incident. But they have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=407.44s)]
*  been fairly subdued so far from what we've gathered. Whether that remains the case, we'll [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=412.02s)]
*  have to wait and see. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  But in the meantime, those that were keen to see this impeachment upheld, those are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  the ones that are celebrating. And those that were keen to see President Yoon keep [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=421.76s)]
*  his position as president, those are the ones that are sad and dejected. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=426.08s)]
*  Steve, what's likely to happen though to Yoon's political movement? As we've seen, he does [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=430.48s)]
*  still have supporters. Is there another figurehead who could replace him and represent him in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=436.32s)]
*  politics? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=442.96s)]
*  Well, that's a big question. What does the party, what does the PPP do now that he has [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=443.96s)]
*  no chance of, now that he's been removed from office? Will they try and distance themselves [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=450.98s)]
*  from what has just happened or will they try and leverage on the support that he does have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=454.94s)]
*  and that we've seen that he has and try and find a successor in that regard? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=459.66s)]
*  For President Yoon himself, he still faces criminal charges or insurrection charges for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  his actions over that declaration of martial law back in early December. So he's going [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=467.82s)]
*  to be having court cases and potential trials once they start picking up. And now the fact [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=472.86s)]
*  that he's no longer the president, it means he doesn't have any of the protections that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=478.70000000000005s)]
*  being president would afford him. So that means that he is potentially going to be tied [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  up with a lot of court proceedings going forward. Whether that's too much baggage for the PPP [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=487.54s)]
*  going into this next election, which as we mentioned earlier, has to be held within the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=492.54s)]
*  next 60 days, well that remains to be seen. Hopefully we get a clearer picture when the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  PPP, his party, starts making more statements following what we've seen play out today with [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=501.22s)]
*  this constitutional court upholding that impeachment vote. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=506.5s)]
*  Indeed, as you say, a presidential election has to happen within the next 60 days. How [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=510.46s)]
*  would you gauge support, the scale of support for the PPP and the other runners and riders [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=515.06s)]
*  who will be participating in that election? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=520.98s)]
*  Yeah, it was really interesting. I mean, we were talking to analysts earlier when the, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=523.98s)]
*  as soon as the impeachment came out and I was asking them about the popularity that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=529.74s)]
*  now former president, Yuen, has and they were saying something quite interesting, but consistently [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=534.3s)]
*  as well amongst the various people that I was speaking to and they said when the impeachment [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=538.9399999999999s)]
*  happened there was almost unanimous thought that president Yuen had overstepped the mark, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=543.3s)]
*  that he needed to be impeached, he needed to be removed from office. But as time went [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=549.86s)]
*  on and as this case got drawn out more and more, there was a sense of a shift in sentiment [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=554.66s)]
*  and whether it was a good narrative, whether it was through pushing of the narrative from [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  president Yuen's camp to say that the actions that he took were to, he wanted to protect [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=568.38s)]
*  the country from North Korean sympathizers or from anti-state actors, he seemed to be [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=574.46s)]
*  getting more and more support as time went by. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=580.26s)]
*  But ultimately, polling suggested just before the constitutional court that 55% or over [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=582.78s)]
*  wanted him to be impeached and he only had support from 30 to 35%. So there was, what [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=588.7s)]
*  started off as being quite unanimous against president Yuen assumed a shift as time went [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=595.9000000000001s)]
*  by. Now that he has been impeached though, we'll have to wait and see what the polling [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=599.46s)]
*  will suggest and whether or not that will then determine which direction the party wants [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=604.5s)]
*  to take. For the opposition, obviously they'll be wanting to make hay with this, they'll [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=609.0200000000001s)]
*  be wanting to go full steam ahead projecting that, you know, see what happened with the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=613.18s)]
*  PPP, see what happened with now former president Yuen. We are the party to take things forward. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=618.26s)]
*  So you know, there's going to be a lot of politicking going on over the next 60 days [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  when this election is going to take place. We don't know when it's going to happen, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd7lxMcg2o&t=628.9s)]
