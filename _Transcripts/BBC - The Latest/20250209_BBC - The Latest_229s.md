The road separates north and south Gaza, and was controlled by Israeli troops.

# Israel pulls out of Netzarim corridor in Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA)
*  To start this hour with breaking news from the Middle East, Israeli forces say they've completed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=0.0s)]
*  their withdrawal from the Netzerim corridor in central Gaza. Now that is the road which separates [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  north and south Gaza and was controlled by Israeli troops. You can see it marked here on the map with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=11.84s)]
*  that red line. Now the move was a condition of the ceasefire deal with Hamas and I want to take you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=18.48s)]
*  to the live pictures from Gaza City where you can see that there are queues of vehicles on that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=24.64s)]
*  road. Now we've seen them moving along the Salah al-Din road after the Israeli forces pull out of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=31.84s)]
*  the Netzerim corridor. We've also seen people walking along that road, others have been on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=39.44s)]
*  donkeys and you can see how that traffic has built up in that area with people trying to move from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=45.84s)]
*  the south back into the north, many of them trying to get back to see what is left of their homes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=53.76s)]
*  Here's another angle that we have where you can see those vehicles are moving. Now our correspondent [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=60.72s)]
*  in Jerusalem, Joe Inwood, has more on the significance of the withdrawal of the troops from that road. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=67.36s)]
*  We had it reported yesterday that this was going to happen and then those pictures that we can see [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=76.8s)]
*  shows that the Israeli forces have withdrawn back. Just to give people a sense of the geography, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=81.92s)]
*  if the Gaza Strip runs like that, the Salah al-Din road runs alongside, parallel with the coast and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=87.12s)]
*  the Netzerim corridor, this is the bit that the Israeli forces have withdrawn from, that cuts it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=93.76s)]
*  in half, basically separating the north from the south. So them withdrawing is not just about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=98.48s)]
*  their forces pulling back, it should allow increased access, increased freedom of movement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  for the people of Gaza. Now we should say that's one of the conditions. There's another road that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=110.24s)]
*  runs north to south that is in between Gaza and Egypt, the Philadelphia corridor, they are still [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=116.0s)]
*  there and they're not moving at this point. But this is an important moment, I think, and it shows [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=120.32s)]
*  that the ceasefire, which has been feeling increasingly fragile, we had both the condition [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=126.24s)]
*  of the hostages that we saw yesterday and the anger around that, but I think more the suggestion [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=132.72s)]
*  by President Donald Trump that Gaza should be depopulated, has led to a sense of increasing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=137.92s)]
*  fragility of this deal. But I think this is, Donna, overstated, but this is another sign that the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire is holding and is continuing. Yeah, on the ceasefire deal, of course, there are talks [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=148.64s)]
*  set to take place in Qatar with both Israel and Hamas saying they will continue the negotiations. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=154.0s)]
*  What do we know about what's going to go on in Qatar? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  So both sides say they will be sending delegations. I think the Hamas delegation has been there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=163.12s)]
*  already and the Israelis will be turning up over the next few days. We don't have precise timelines. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=167.44s)]
*  But what we know the Israelis want to talk about first is technical matters surrounding phase one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=172.8s)]
*  Just to remind people, the ceasefire deal is split into three phases. Phase one is where we are now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=179.12s)]
*  It's 42 days long, sees 33 hostages released in exchange for a large number of panelists. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Phase two is the most consequential one in many ways because it would see what they call a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  sustainable calm, basically a permanent end to the fighting and the release of all remaining [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=196.24s)]
*  living Israeli hostages. We think that what they are going to discuss at first is technical issues [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  around phase one before they move on to the issues around phase two. It's also worth pointing out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=205.52s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu is on his way back from Washington where we have had these quite [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=210.96s)]
*  consequential discussions with the Americans. I think the Israeli negotiators aren't going to be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=215.92s)]
*  empowered to talk about phase two until he has discussed what his conditions are with his cabinet. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8zuIWmrqA&t=219.11999999999998s)]
