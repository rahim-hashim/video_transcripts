# South Korea to expand military support to Ukraine – BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs)
*  South Korea's President Yunus Soek-yul has said he will expand his country's military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=0.0s)]
*  and humanitarian aid support to Ukraine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=10.08s)]
*  He was speaking during a surprise visit in Kyiv. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=12.56s)]
*  He confirmed Seoul would continue to supply much needed military equipment, including [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=16.2s)]
*  bulletproof vests and helmets. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=20.6s)]
*  South Korea has one of the largest stockpiles of ammunition in the world and a thriving [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  defence industry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=27.2s)]
*  But government policy prohibits arms deliveries to countries at war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Now Ukraine and its allies have been urging Seoul to make an exception. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=32.96s)]
*  We can hear now from him and President Zelenskyy in this press conference. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=37.8s)]
*  South Korea will continue to provide military supplies that Ukraine needs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=42.16s)]
*  Following last year's military supplies such as bulletproof vests and helmets, we will [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=50.76s)]
*  support military equipment on a larger scale this year. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=55.52s)]
*  I can happily state that the agreement to transfer the transport and special equipment, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=59.2s)]
*  including demining cars, is already being executed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=68.0s)]
*  It helps us to save lives. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=72.0s)]
*  OK, we can go now to our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=73.84s)]
*  James, we don't often see Asian leaders in Ukraine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=78.64s)]
*  Can you just give us a sense of the significance of this visit? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=83.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=86.24s)]
*  We don't often see them there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=88.72s)]
*  The president of Indonesia went last year, the Japanese prime minister was earlier this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=91.44s)]
*  year, China has sent an envoy earlier this year. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=94.88s)]
*  But that's few and far between. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=99.8s)]
*  Kyiv is a sort of conveyor belt of European and American politicians visiting almost on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=102.4s)]
*  a daily basis. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=106.56s)]
*  So it is unusual. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, I think diplomats will take some comfort for this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=109.28s)]
*  One of the great failures of the West, Europe and the United States in this war, has been [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  to try and convince the rest of the world that it matters to them as well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=118.56s)]
*  The large parts of the world see this war as a European issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=121.48s)]
*  They are frustrated that the war continues because it is disrupting their own economies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=126.0s)]
*  Europe and Ukraine and the United States have gone out to the world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=132.0s)]
*  We think this matters to you as well because it matters about sovereignty, territorial [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=135.08s)]
*  integrity, those are universal concerns. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=138.88s)]
*  And I think having a country like South Korea visit Ukraine, I think it's the first time [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=141.72s)]
*  ever that a South Korean leader has ever been to Ukraine, is significant because essentially [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  the message is, look, South Korea of all countries is concerned about the threat to its territorial [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=152.16s)]
*  integrity to a neighbor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=159.24s)]
*  They have something in common with Ukraine and the Russian situation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=162.82s)]
*  So I think diplomatically it is symbolically significant. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=166.08s)]
*  And James, the South Korean president said he will expand his country's military and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=169.68s)]
*  humanitarian aid for Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  That sounds like a win for President Zelensky. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=176.8s)]
*  Well, I think what we have to do here is read between the lines. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=179.12s)]
*  In terms of the absolute amount, shifting from $100 million to $150 million this year [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=183.96s)]
*  in humanitarian aid, it sounds like a lot of money, but in the grand scheme of things, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  it's not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=195.32s)]
*  I mean, if you think that the United States so far has given north of 40 billion pounds [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=196.32s)]
*  to Ukraine since the invasion last year, what Ukraine, as South Korea is doing, is pretty [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=202.2s)]
*  modest. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  Also, remember, he's talking about support, increasing the support without saying precisely [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  how much of non-lethal military aid. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  So we're talking logistical support. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=217.04s)]
*  We're talking helmets, body armor, communications, demining equipment, things like that, all [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=219.64s)]
*  of which are useful. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=226.76s)]
*  But I think what's significant is this, the fact that President Zelensky did not make [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  some grand demand saying, we want your weapons, because South Korea has lots of weapons. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  It has lots of stockpiles of exactly the kind of shells that President Zelensky wants. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=238.0s)]
*  Now, the fact that President Zelensky didn't ask for those publicly and bang the drum suggests [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  which is that at the moment he is content for South Korea to sell lots of weapons to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=248.44s)]
*  European countries who need to replenish their own stocks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=254.04s)]
*  And the suggestion is, the speculation, the understanding is that some of those weapons [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=258.76s)]
*  enter Ukraine via a third party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=264.36s)]
*  So technically, at that point, they are not South Korean, but they are helping the Ukrainian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  war effort. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=272.84s)]
*  That is something at the moment Ukraine seems to be content with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=273.84s)]
*  And James, South Korea, a big economy, a big power in its region. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  How will other countries in that Asian area and the Asia Pacific feel about this visit? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you think there'll be pressure on them to perhaps respond in a similar way? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  As you say, Japan's Japanese leaders already visited. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=293.84s)]
*  I don't think it'll put that much pressure on neighbors simply because they've had a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  long time to make their decision on this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  Most of them thus far have stayed largely out of this because they've seen it largely [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=304.22s)]
*  as a European war and they've been nervous about it disrupting the global economy and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  the fact that it's had an impact on fertilizer, food prices, inflation more generally. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=316.22s)]
*  That is their concern rather than whether or not they should support Kyiv in its war effort. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=321.42s)]
*  I think what's interesting for South Korea is this, is that South Korea has to be very [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=326.94000000000005s)]
*  careful about this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  It's concerned about North Korea. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  It's concerned about alienating Russia too much because Russia could put pressure on [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=335.18s)]
*  North Korea to act in certain ways. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=339.74s)]
*  And I think that is something that South Korea is nervous about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=342.62s)]
*  But what's interesting is that South Korea is having to deal with that classic tussle [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=346.22s)]
*  that many other countries are dealing with between the competing pressures on the one [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=351.18s)]
*  hand of economic stability and not disrupting their own trade flows in the area, but equally [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=355.9s)]
*  they want to try and say, well, actually, maybe we do need to do more to support democracy, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=362.62s)]
*  to support sovereignty and territorial integrity. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  In other words, there's an argument here and they want to be on the right side of that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=369.02s)]
*  argument and it seems that Korea and South Korea at least is edging a little bit closer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=373.02s)]
*  to that argument. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WfVNmp3vs&t=379.09999999999997s)]
