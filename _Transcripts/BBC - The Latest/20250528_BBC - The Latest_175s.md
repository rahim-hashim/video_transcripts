Video Description: The UN Human Rights Office has said it believes 47 people were injured in Gaza on Tuesday when crowds overwhelmed an aid distribution centre run by a controversial new group backed by the US and Israel.
 
A senior official said the UN was still gathering information but that most of the injuries were due to gunshots and that "it was shooting from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]".
 
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said one person was killed and 48 others were wounded.
 
The IDF said it was checking the reports. 
 
A spokesman said troops fired "warning shots" into the air in the area outside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's site in the southern city of Rafah but that they did not fire towards people.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U)
*  But let's take you to the Middle East now where aid distribution in Gaza is expected to continue shortly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=0.0s)]
*  By this controversial new American backed group the Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=5.7s)]
*  They were chaotic scenes yesterday when desperate Palestinians overwhelmed one distribution hub in Rafa in southern Gaza [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=10.96s)]
*  Israel says it fired warning shots to disperse the crowd [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  What we're now hearing from the UN is that at least 47 people were injured in the ensuing chaos [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=21.04s)]
*  Many sustaining gunshot wounds as well [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=27.72s)]
*  The group has been criticized by the UN and others as a waste of resources [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=30.72s)]
*  The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees says it's a distraction [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=34.72s)]
*  And that there's already an aid system ready to go in Gaza being run by UNRWA [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=38.72s)]
*  Philippe Lazzarini saying his team must be allowed to do their work and that the clock is ticking towards famine [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=43.72s)]
*  Israel says an alternative to the current aid system is needed to stop Hamas stealing aid [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=48.72s)]
*  This is something that Hamas denies [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=53.72s)]
*  Our Middle East correspondent Yulana Nel-Hajmo [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=56.72s)]
*  We know that basically a large number of people, hundreds of thousands according to some estimates [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=59.72s)]
*  Started heading towards this center which is called the Hamas aid center [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=65.72s)]
*  They started heading towards this center which is in Rafa in the very south of the Gaza Strip [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=70.72s)]
*  In an area that's under full Israeli military control [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=76.72s)]
*  There had been reports word had got to them that some Palestinians had managed to successfully get these food boxes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=79.72s)]
*  Despite some of the Hamas threats that had been circulating [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=86.72s)]
*  Despite the fact that they had been very worried about the Israeli security controls there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=90.72s)]
*  And that really led to a rush on the center with food boxes being taken, staff withdrawing at the site [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=95.72s)]
*  Including the US military contractors who were there [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=102.72s)]
*  And also even tables and chairs were stolen apparently [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=107.72s)]
*  Then the Israeli military said that its troops opened fire [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=112.72s)]
*  And we've just heard from the UN human rights office that at least 47 Palestinians were injured [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=116.72s)]
*  It says most of them are due to gunfire [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=122.72s)]
*  So these scenes of chaos [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=126.72s)]
*  But still at the end of the day the assessment given in the Israeli media from the Israeli security establishment [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=129.72s)]
*  Is that this was a blow to Hamas and that things went successfully [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=136.72s)]
*  The Gaza humanitarian foundation saying that 8,000 food boxes were given out [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=140.72s)]
*  And that there weren't plans to change this mechanism [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=146.72s)]
*  We haven't got a clear picture of what's going on in Gaza this morning [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=149.72s)]
*  But initially the plan we were told was for two of these distribution hubs [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=154.72s)]
*  Secure distribution hubs as the Gaza humanitarian foundation calls them to be opened in Rafah [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=160.72s)]
*  But some Palestinians saying that they expect the suspension of these deliveries [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgnPfPQRJ2U&t=166.72s)]
