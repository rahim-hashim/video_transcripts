Video Description: Heathrow Airport, which has been closed all day due to a fire at a substation that knocked out the power to the airport, says it's now "safely able to restart flights".
 
Counter-terrorism detectives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire, but say there is "no suggestion at the moment of sabotage or foul play".
 
The airport now says it hopes to "run a full operation tomorrow and will provide further information shortly".

*  for many years, describing it as an unprecedented situation, which of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=116.12s)]
*  course, it absolutely has been. Yes, absolutely, and Heathrow airport [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=119.76s)]
*  apologising for the inconvenience caused by this incident, but it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=124.04s)]
*  may be unprecedented, but in terms of the chaos, it has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=129.84s)]
*  staggering, hasn't it? Absolutely staggering, Matthew. The number of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=134.24s)]
*  people I have spoken to in hotel lobbies and in pubs having a meal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  because they have nothing else to do surrounded by their suitcases. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=145.48s)]
*  Whilst the airport is saying it will be fully operational tomorrow, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=148.76s)]
*  there is going to be a backlog. All these people that were supposed to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=152.92s)]
*  be flying into or out of or through Heathrow today still need to make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  those journeys if they haven't already come up with other plans, so [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=160.12s)]
*  you need to sort out those people as well, not forgetting, of course, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=163.2s)]
*  those cargo flights. And then, of course, for all these people who [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  have been caught up in this, there is the burden of going through [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=170.6s)]
*  the airport, getting their money back, whether it is a complaint to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=173.96s)]
*  the airline, compensation, a refund on their credit card for a hotel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  they booked, a refund from their travel agent for a holiday they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=180.24s)]
*  were not able to go on. This is going to be a real headache for a lot [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=183.44s)]
*  of people lasting several days and weeks. Rich, thanks very much. We [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=187.36s)]
*  will be back to you in the next little while. Just to recap, before [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  we take a break, Heathrow airport saying that they will resume some [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  flights later today. That is significantly earlier than expected. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=201.0s)]
*  The airport originally closed till midnight and it was thought it would [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=206.64s)]
*  take days perhaps for the disruption to completely clear with aircraft [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=210.12s)]
*  being in the wrong place. These are the live pictures from Heathrow. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=214.68s)]
*  So, encouragement for all those people who have been disrupted live on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=218.28s)]
*  the programme. We will get a little more about just the technical [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=223.16s)]
*  reasons why an airport, a huge part of the UK's infrastructure was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=226.92s)]
*  closed at a stroke. We will also talk to someone actually caught up in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  the chaos. It is his birthday but he ended up being diverted to Barcelona. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=237.32s)]
*  So, we will talk to a range of guests reacting to this development. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=242.44s)]
*  So, do stay with us. Plenty more on this breaking development. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQz5tYQfmd0&t=246.0s)]
