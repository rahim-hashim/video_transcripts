Video Description: Joel Le Scouarnec, the former surgeon who has admitted sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children - many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations - between 1989 and 2014 has been sentenced to 20 years in jail.
 
Le Scouarnec admitted the charges during a session held behind closed doors in March and was already in jail after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children. 
 
The former doctor has been on trial in Brittany since late February. During that time dozens of his victims have testified, telling the court how the abuse they sustained as children shaped their lives.

*  admitting repeatedly to decades spent abusing hundreds of children. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=54.22s)]
*  I am a paedophile and a child rapist, he told the court. I was finally able to accept that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=59.22s)]
*  It was a relief. I've come to understand the suffering of my victims. I devastated their [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=66.22s)]
*  lives. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=71.14s)]
*  During the trial, the prosecution called the retired surgeon a devil in a white coat. His [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=73.18s)]
*  crimes left some of his 300 or more victims struggling with trauma they barely understood. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=81.34s)]
*  Today, grown up, many of those victims told us they had no trust in the Esquarnac's expressions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=87.5s)]
*  of remorse. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=95.86s)]
*  I saw no sincerity from him. I just hope he cannot hurt people anymore. But I don't expect [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=98.66s)]
*  him to change. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=104.18s)]
*  Esquarnac spent years raping patients in rural hospitals. But administrators knew as far [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=105.9s)]
*  back as 2005 that he was a paedophile, that he'd watched child abuse online. He still [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=112.22s)]
*  kept his job. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  This case has exposed serious failings by the French police and medical establishment [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  who could have intervened and stopped Esquarnac's crimes many years earlier. There's also real [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=126.78s)]
*  concern today that the issue of child abuse is still not being taken seriously enough [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  by the French establishment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=139.14s)]
*  Last year, Gisele Pellico drew global attention to the trial of her 50 rapists and to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=143.38s)]
*  issue of drug-facilitated rape. By contrast, many of Esquarnac's victims feel forgotten. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=149.38s)]
*  Some have now begun to protest, accusing the French authorities and local medical bosses [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=159.46s)]
*  of failing to accept their share of the blame. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=165.3s)]
*  They're in denial. It's both individual and collective. It's quite astonishing, really. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=168.58s)]
*  Our government and our society are not outraged. The rape of children seems too complicated [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=175.54s)]
*  to acknowledge. France denies this exists. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=182.82s)]
*  Perhaps this trial, with all its devastating detail, will now prompt some soul-searching [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=188.34s)]
*  in France. Esquarnac himself says he wants to become a better person, to regain his humanity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=193.62s)]
*  during the long years that now await him in prison. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jALwohyMfik&t=201.62s)]
