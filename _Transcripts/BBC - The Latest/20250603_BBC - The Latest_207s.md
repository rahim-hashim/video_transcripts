Video Description: The United Nations has said children in Sudan are facing "unimaginable suffering" in the country's ongoing civil war.
 
More than 150,000 people have been killed during Sudan's conflict, which began over two years ago when Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began a vicious struggle for power.
 
Millions have been forced from their homes and the UN says close to four million children are acutely malnourished across the country.
 
Around 730,000 are suffering life-threatening severe acute malnutrition.
