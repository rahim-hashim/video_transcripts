Video Description: A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter over the North Sea collision, police said.
 
One of the ships, the Solong, is still alight after it collided with a US oil tanker, Stena Immaculate, according to its owners.
 
One crew member of the Solong is unaccounted for and the working assumption is that they have died, a UK minister said.
 
Owners of the cargo ship said it was not carrying sodium cyanide, as previously reported, but had four empty containers that had once held the toxic chemical.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA)
*  Let's return straightaway to that breaking news of the last 20 minutes or so. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=0.0s)]
*  A man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence, manslaughter, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=4.0s)]
*  following the collision of an oil tanker and a container ship in the North Sea yesterday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=8.0s)]
*  These are the live pictures from the coast and you can see just on the horizon the tanker [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=14.0s)]
*  and throughout the day they've continued to try to actually put out the fires. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=19.0s)]
*  A crew member of the container ship, the Solong, is still missing following the crash [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=24.0s)]
*  and the search has been called off. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=29.0s)]
*  Let's go straight to our reporter Rowan Bridge who is in Grimsby Forest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=32.0s)]
*  Rowan, tell us more about what the police have been saying. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=36.0s)]
*  Yes, as you were saying Matthew, they've put out a statement at about half past three this afternoon [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=43.0s)]
*  confirming that a 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence, manslaughter, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=47.0s)]
*  following this collision yesterday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=54.0s)]
*  And there is a crew member missing still from the Solong who is now presumed dead. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=56.0s)]
*  Humbassai police have taken the lead on the criminal investigation into the crash yesterday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=61.0s)]
*  We also have an investigation going on by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=67.0s)]
*  But in terms of the criminal investigation, they say Humbassai police are still working to establish [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=72.0s)]
*  the full circumstances of what has happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=76.0s)]
*  They say they have appointed family liaison officers to liaise with the family [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=79.0s)]
*  of the missing man who is presumed to be dead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=83.0s)]
*  And they say that the person they arrested remains in custody while inquiries continue [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=86.0s)]
*  and they continue to speak with all of those involved in the incident to establish fully what has happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=91.0s)]
*  I suspect they will be looking at both the black boxes aboard the Solong and the Stenna Immaculate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=97.0s)]
*  and also speaking to crew members of both vessels who managed to escape from the scene yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=103.0s)]
*  They have been put up in hotels in the Grimsby area overnight and into today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=109.0s)]
*  Rowan, is there any sort of indication, I know it is early, but how this collision actually happened? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=114.0s)]
*  What are the people saying to you in terms of the agencies of how long it will take to get some sort of preliminary decision on that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think they are working at this at speed, Matthew. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean the Marine Accident Investigation Branch had investigators down at the scene within a matter of hours [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=134.0s)]
*  and I'm sure they will be looking to recover the black boxes from both ships to extract the data from there [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=141.0s)]
*  and interview the people who are on board both ships in terms of what has happened. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=148.0s)]
*  We don't have a timeline at the moment as to how long that investigation will take. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=152.0s)]
*  A couple of other details though just to give you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=158.0s)]
*  We've had a statement in the last few minutes from Graham Stewart, who is the MP for Beverley and Holderness, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=160.0s)]
*  one of the local MPs. He's put out a statement to his constituents with a few more details. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=165.0s)]
*  He said that so far there is no sign of any heavy engine oil leaking from either ship, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=170.0s)]
*  which is good news in terms of potential pollution and threat to marine life and wildlife. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=175.0s)]
*  He also said that the Solong is currently about three miles offshore with a line attached to it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=180.0s)]
*  and none of the containers on board appear to have come off it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=185.0s)]
*  And also that the jet fuel that was on board the Stenner Immaculate, there was 227,000 barrels, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=189.0s)]
*  most of that appears to have burned off. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=197.0s)]
*  Now if that all turns out to be true, that is hopefully more positive news in terms of the potential environmental impact of this crash, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=200.0s)]
*  which is the other thing that clearly people are concerned about at the moment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=207.0s)]
*  Rowan, thanks for the latest. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=212.0s)]
*  And as Rowan was finishing that answer, let me tell you just the latest line from the police saying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=214.0s)]
*  the man arrested remains in custody at this time while inquiries are still underway. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=219.0s)]
*  So that the latest on that breaking story. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzQPoo48eA&t=224.0s)]
