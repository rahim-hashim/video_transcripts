*  between the two countries goes into a second day. Now, I'll take you to the latest pictures [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  in a moment, but we want to start with the key developments this hour. Iran has targeted [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=15.84s)]
*  ballistic missiles at Israel as its supreme leader vows to inflict heavy blows. It's now [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=22.16s)]
*  being reported that at least three people in Israel have been killed. The Israeli defence [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=29.04s)]
*  forces says it is continuing to strike targets in Iran. The IDF says they are aimed at removing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=34.48s)]
*  threats. Previously, nuclear sites and military leaders were targeted. The UN says 78 people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=41.04s)]
*  have been killed. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has accused Israel of starting a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=48.64s)]
*  war. Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, has called Israel's operation an act of national preservation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=55.12s)]
*  President Trump has called on Iran to strike a deal with Israel over its nuclear development, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  but talks scheduled for Sunday seem unlikely to go ahead. In the last hour or so, Jordan has said [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=69.12s)]
*  that it has reopened airspace. It had suspended flights due to the strikes. Well, let me take you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  to the live pictures from Tel Aviv. Our team in Israel say that when the sirens sounded just before [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=82.32s)]
*  dawn, millions of people across the country sought shelter. The authorities in Israel don't allow us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  to share the exact location of missile strikes for fear it will provide useful information to the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=95.44s)]
*  Iranian military. But I want to take you to some pictures from central Israel. Now, this is where [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=102.32s)]
*  there was a direct hit by an Iranian missile on a residential building. And in the last few minutes, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=109.44s)]
*  the Israeli emergency services have confirmed that two people died when that residential [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  area was hit by a rocket. We're told it was a woman in her 60s who was rescued unconscious and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=124.72s)]
*  without vital signs. And also a man around the age of 45 who the Israeli emergency service, the MDA, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=133.28s)]
*  say was pronounced dead after being evacuated. You can see that there is still an operation going on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=142.72s)]
*  around that area where that Iranian rocket hit that residential building. We understand around 20 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  people were also injured in this particular incident. Israeli media reporting that across [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=158.24s)]
*  the country, three people have been killed. And I want to show you some of the pictures that we've [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=164.48s)]
*  been getting in. You will see the moment that that missile hits. Now, the Israeli military says it has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=170.16s)]
*  been intercepting missiles throughout the night. You can hear in the background the air raid sirens [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=179.28s)]
*  have been sounding as people went to their shelters. Now, in Iran itself, explosions have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=186.56s)]
*  been heard just outside Tehran and several blasts were heard at the city's Maribad airport. Now, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=192.4s)]
*  Iran's raids are a response to Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets early on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=199.52s)]
*  Friday. Iran says 78 people were killed and 320 injured in Israel's initial attacks. Well, the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=206.8s)]
*  Iranian leader Ayatollah Khamenei says Israel has launched a war and will suffer heavy blows in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  return. Last night, there was an emergency session at the United Nations Security Council. And despite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=223.36s)]
*  Washington's efforts to distance the US from any involvement in Israel's strikes, Iran's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=230.08s)]
*  ambassador to the UN accused the US of complicity. Here is some of what he had to say at that session [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=236.4s)]
*  a few hours ago. The United States complicity in this terrorist attack is beyond doubt. The officials [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=243.28s)]
*  of the United States have expressly and presently confessed their willful aid and assistance in the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  crimes and gross violation that Israeli regime committed as of last night, including the deliberate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=258.32s)]
*  transfer of arms. We will not forget that our people lost their lives as a result of the Israeli [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=265.92s)]
*  attacks with American weapons. These actions amount to declaration of war. Well, Israel's ambassador [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=273.44s)]
*  to the UN, Danny Danon, also accuses Iran of intending to destroy Israel. We know our enemies. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  We know their ideology. And when a regime builds ballistic missiles, enriches uranium [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=291.6s)]
*  to near weapons grade and openly declares its intent to destroy us, we believe them. We take them [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  at their word. And we take action before it is too late. And there was this stark warning from the US [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=310.16s)]
*  representative at the Security Council meeting. No government, proxy or independent actor should [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=319.6s)]
*  target American citizens, American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=328.72s)]
*  The consequences for Iran would be dire. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDv-LvNppI&t=338.0s)]
