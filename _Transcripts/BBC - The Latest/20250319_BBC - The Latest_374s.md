Ekrem Imamoglu, from the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), is seen as one of Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan's strongest political rivals.

# Turkey detains President Erdogan’s main rival days before becoming candidate | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg)
*  Now supporters of the Turkish opposition have defied a ban of protests. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=0.0s)]
*  It was issued after the arrest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=4.96s)]
*  the popular mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=10.16s)]
*  Well the protest ban issued by the governor of Istanbul came amid reports of the clap down [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=13.84s)]
*  on social media platforms. The detention has occurred just days before the opposition figure [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=20.16s)]
*  due to be announced as the presidential candidate for the Republican People's Party. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=26.24s)]
*  Well, Mr. Imamoglu posted the following statement just before his arrest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=31.6s)]
*  I say with regret that a handful of minds are trying to usurp the will of our nation by abusing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  the police. The security forces of this country have messed at the door of my home, homes of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  16 million Istanbulites. Hundreds of police are masked. We are facing bullying, but I want you to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=55.2s)]
*  know that I won't be undaunted. I love you all so much. I entrust myself to my people. Let all our [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  nation know that I will stand upright. I will continue to fight with that person and his mind [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  which uses this whole process like an apparatus. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=81.12s)]
*  So that was Ekrem Imamoglu speaking issuing that statement just before his arrest and of course [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=89.36s)]
*  now we are seeing protesters out on the streets. So we are monitoring the live shot of that as [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=96.72s)]
*  we know that supporters of the Turkish opposition have been defying what was a ban of protests. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=106.08s)]
*  They are out on the streets. So a lot of moving, fast moving, developing situation when it comes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=114.08s)]
*  to what is happening in Turkey. Let's cross over to Istanbul because Emily Wither joins us live now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=120.4s)]
*  In a moment we will get the very latest from her, but just a little bit of background to this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=128.24s)]
*  Turkish prosecutors have spoken since that statement by Ekrem Imamoglu. They have said [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=133.44s)]
*  that Mr. Imamoglu has been charged with being head of a criminal organization and also of bribery and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=141.84s)]
*  extortion. They say that there are also local reports that he is accused of aiding [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  the banned Kurdish Workers Party, an organization that is banned in Turkey. They say that over a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=154.96s)]
*  hundred others have been detained as part of the same probe. Mr. Imamoglu's party, the CHP, have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=162.64s)]
*  said that his detention marks a coup attempt against our next president. We know that there is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  an election coming up and that Recep Tayyip Erdogan after his many many years in power will not be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  able to stand for re-election. So a fluid situation in Turkey. We can cross over live as promised to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=183.76s)]
*  our correspondent there, Emily Wither who joins us from Istanbul. Emily, I think it's important just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=190.48s)]
*  remind us what is happening on the ground because despite a ban people are out on the streets. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=195.76s)]
*  That's right, we are seeing some small protests now in Istanbul outside the office and at a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=205.12s)]
*  university here. Those university protests have already been broken up by the police. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=211.2s)]
*  I should say that the protests now are very small. The authorities are doing everything they can to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=216.0s)]
*  make sure that people do not gather on the streets here. They have closed many major roads into the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=222.0s)]
*  city. They have closed down popular metro stops. They have restricted the use of social media for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=226.96s)]
*  some popular apps. They have also banned any rallies or protests here for the next four days. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=232.8s)]
*  Whether we see larger numbers coming out onto the streets despite all of those risks, we will just [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=239.6s)]
*  have to see. In the past we have seen people gathering on their balconies or gathering at [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=244.88s)]
*  their windows and banging pots and pans in protest. We might see that later on this evening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=250.48s)]
*  But at the moment this is a city braced now to see whether these protests get any larger. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=255.76s)]
*  And Emily, just remind us why Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey, why he feels so threatened [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=261.52s)]
*  by the Mayor of Istanbul? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=268.32s)]
*  The Mayor of Istanbul is incredibly charismatic and he is incredibly popular. In many polls it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=270.72s)]
*  shows that Erdogan is pretty much neck and neck with Ekrem Ememoli. He was due to have a big rally [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=276.72s)]
*  today in support for his presidential candidacy, which is due to be announced in the coming days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=282.48s)]
*  The opposition were going to name him as their future presidential candidate. I should say that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  critics here are saying that this crackdown could backfire on him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=294.56s)]
*  In 2019 when Ekrem Ememoli won the mayor elections here, the Erdogan's government said [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=298.56s)]
*  that those elections were rigged and they called for a rerun. In that rerun, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=306.08s)]
*  Ememoli came out even more popular. It could be that this crackdown sees the Mayor gaining even [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=310.88s)]
*  more votes. He is very popular across the political divide and he is seen as a key [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=317.04s)]
*  challenger to Tayyip Erdogan. This has been going on for months now. The government here has been [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=322.08s)]
*  cracking down on opposition figures for some time. They have been arresting opposition mayors, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=327.12s)]
*  journalists and business leaders. I think what is interesting is that there has been very little [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=333.12s)]
*  international condemnation of that. It could be that President Erdogan is also gambling that the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=338.0s)]
*  arrest of this mayor will also go unnoticed given Turkey's strategic position. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=343.68s)]
*  Thank you for bringing us up to date with the latest fluid situation on the ground in Istanbul. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM7HKu7dAkg&t=349.92s)]
