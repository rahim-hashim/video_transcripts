Video Description: US President Donald Trump has ordered officials to make plans to declassify documents related to the killings of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr.

"A lot of people are waiting for this for long, for years, for decades," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.

The order directs top administration officials to present a plan to declassify the documents within 15 days. 

But, that does not make it certain it will happen.

**BBC - The Latest:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng)
*  Donald Trump has signed an executive order declassifying files on the assassinations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=0.0s)]
*  of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and the civil rights leader [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=5.2s)]
*  Martin Luther King. Uncertainty still surrounds the shooting of President Kennedy in Dallas [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  in 1963 with suggestions of Cuban involvement. Martin Luther King's family have alleged that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=14.44s)]
*  his killing was a US government conspiracy after the man convicted of murder denied carrying [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=20.68s)]
*  it out. Mr Trump has been busy signing executive orders including one designed to bring to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=26.08s)]
*  an end what's called birthright citizenship but now a judge in Seattle has blocked the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=31.68s)]
*  move calling it blatantly unconstitutional. This was the response from Donald Trump when [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=36.36s)]
*  he was told the news. Mr President, a US judge took rarely blocks the birthright citizenship [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=41.8s)]
*  order. Do you have any reaction? No, obviously we'll appeal it. They put it before a certain [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  judge in Seattle I guess right and there's no surprises with that judge. Well the amendment [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=53.0s)]
*  in question, the one that has traditionally guaranteed birthright citizenship, is the 14th [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  amendment. Adopted after the American Civil War the wording goes as follows, all persons born or [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=66.04s)]
*  naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=72.0s)]
*  States. Let's speak to CBS correspondent Naomi Rahim. Naomi, why has President Trump decided to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=78.36s)]
*  declassify the JFK files first of all? Well there are many answers to this, Martin, and good morning [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=85.64s)]
*  to you. There's a lot of questions as you mentioned about what exactly happened during those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=92.52s)]
*  assassinations and it seems he's trying to perhaps answer those questions or at least provide whatever [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=98.8s)]
*  answers are possible. Still it is quite controversial. Now the FBI says it is identifying [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  records related to the assassinations but it comes after President Trump signed that executive [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=111.92s)]
*  order. He claims it's a move to restore transparency in Washington and it's a tight deadline [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  for the incoming director of national intelligence and the attorney general who by the way have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=124.92s)]
*  not yet even been confirmed by the Senate but according to President Trump's order there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=130.12s)]
*  must be a plan to release the RFK and MLK files within 45 days and then they'll have just 15 days [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=135.08s)]
*  to propose a plan to release the JFK files. The goal the president says is to reverse the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  over classification of government documents. White House officials have not yet said which or how [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  many of them should be released but the National Archives did make public a trove of more than [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=155.0s)]
*  13,000 documents related to the JFK assassination back in 2022 shortly after then President Biden [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=161.12s)]
*  issued an executive order authorizing their disclosure. His administration though did keep [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=169.0s)]
*  thousands of other sensitive records under wraps. Martine? Just briefly on this subject how much [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=174.4s)]
*  is there likely to be new? A lot of it's already in the public domain. Yeah so much of it is public [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=182.12s)]
*  this may just be a gesture to show the president's supporters that he is making good on a promise to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=188.52s)]
*  offer this sort of transparency but it's unclear what's really left in there and as you mentioned [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=195.24s)]
*  there are some conspiracy questions about what might have happened but generally the mainstream [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=201.52s)]
*  knowledge in this country is that those men were murdered in the ways that we know. Martine? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Moving on to the other issue of birthright citizenship how problematic for Donald Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=213.36s)]
*  is the description from that judge in Seattle that it's blatantly unconstitutional? Well Martine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  this was generally expected from any judge as revoking birthright citizenship is so contrary [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  to the American standard of being a place of refuge. If you were born here you're American [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=233.24s)]
*  it's truly hard to imagine that changing under law especially under the Constitution. The goal [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=239.12s)]
*  here however may be deterrence from the president to prevent something called birth tourism where an [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=244.96s)]
*  immigrant might come here just to have their child born as an American. Now a federal judge in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  Seattle has temporarily blocked President Trump's new executive order that seeks to eliminate [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=256.44s)]
*  that right. At the hearing yesterday the judge called Trump's order blatantly unconstitutional [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=261.72s)]
*  and said he will grant the request for a temporary restraining order sought by four [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=268.0s)]
*  democrat-led states that challenged it including Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon. In fact [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=273.12s)]
*  citing his four decades on the bench the judge said he can't remember a case that presented a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=279.92s)]
*  question as clear as this one. The judge's order will remain in place while legal proceedings [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=285.52s)]
*  continue. It's an early blow to the unilateral efforts taken by Mr. Trump to crack down on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=291.36s)]
*  immigration which he promised to do on the campaign trail and began to pursue almost [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=298.8s)]
*  immediately after he was sworn in for his second term on Monday. A Department of Justice [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  spokesperson said that the department will vigorously defend President Trump's order [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=309.68s)]
*  which they claim does correctly interpret the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and Mr. Trump [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=315.44s)]
*  told reporters that they will appeal that decision. Martine? Lots to cover, Naomi, as always thank you very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5DI-Zb4ng&t=321.92s)]
