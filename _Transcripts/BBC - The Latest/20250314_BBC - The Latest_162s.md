Video Description: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he agrees with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that "questions" remain about the nature of a truce - as he set out a number of tough conditions for peace.
 
He was responding to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to earlier this week following talks with the US.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described Putin's response to the plan as "manipulative" and called for more sanctions on Russia.
 
Meanwhile, the US placed further sanctions on Russian oil, gas and banking sectors.

*  to a proposed 30-day ceasefire. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=13.92s)]
*  Mr Putin said that he supported the plan put forward by the US [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=16.4s)]
*  but said crucial details still had to be resolved. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=21.32s)]
*  President Trump described Mr Putin's comments [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=24.52s)]
*  as promising but not complete. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=27.08s)]
*  The US envoy Steve Witkoff has been in Moscow [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=30.2s)]
*  where he's expected to meet the Russian president. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=33.28s)]
*  Our North America correspondent David Willis has this report. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=36.0s)]
*  Amidst this US motorcade en route to the Kremlin, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=41.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's chief negotiator, Steve Witkoff, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  in Moscow to put his boss's ceasefire deal to Vladimir Putin [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=47.92s)]
*  but made to wait whilst the Russian leader [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=52.64s)]
*  greeted his Belarusian ally, Alexander Lubashenko. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=55.08s)]
*  And when President Putin addressed the issue [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=59.36s)]
*  after a closed doors meeting with the special envoy, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=61.92s)]
*  his agreement in principle came with strings attached. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=64.88s)]
*  We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=70.72s)]
*  but we proceed from the fact that this cessation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=73.56s)]
*  should be such that it would lead to long-term peace [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=76.0s)]
*  and eliminate the essential causes of this crisis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=78.88s)]
*  A quick end to the fighting. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=82.44s)]
*  A sense of caution not lost on Donald Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  who called the Russian leader's response promising [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=88.0s)]
*  but not complete. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  A lot of the details of a final agreement [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=92.28s)]
*  have actually been discussed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=94.56s)]
*  Now we're going to see whether or not Russia's there [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=97.2s)]
*  and if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=100.4s)]
*  for the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=102.92s)]
*  An immediate interim ceasefire agreed upon by US [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=104.28s)]
*  and Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=107.8s)]
*  earlier this week now seems somewhat optimistic [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  and in his nightly video address, Ukraine's president [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  accused the Russians of playing for time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  We now have all heard from Russia, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=122.88s)]
*  Putin's very predictable, very manipulative words [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=124.24s)]
*  in response to the idea of a ceasefire. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  He is actually preparing a refusal as of now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=130.0s)]
*  Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=135.76s)]
*  he wants to kill Ukrainians. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=138.56s)]
*  All this comes as Russia is smelling victory [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=141.08s)]
*  in the Kursk region after finally repelling Ukrainian forces [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  some seven months after their incursion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Seizing with it what Ukraine had hoped [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=151.28s)]
*  would be a vital bargaining chip [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  in any future peace negotiations. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNRc4FciK2Q&t=156.24s)]
