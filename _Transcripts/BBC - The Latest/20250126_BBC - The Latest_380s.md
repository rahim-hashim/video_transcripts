# Trump, Biden and the politics of presidential pardons | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA)
*  January the 6th, 2021, looked like the end of Donald Trump's political career. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Over 1,500 of his supporters would be charged for actions including attempting to overthrow the government, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=5.68s)]
*  assaulting police officers and obstructing the certification of the election result. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=11.4s)]
*  But it was far from the end. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=16.0s)]
*  And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump signalled he was considering pardoning those convicted. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=19.16s)]
*  On precisely who? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=24.04s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance said recently, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=25.52s)]
*  if you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=27.84s)]
*  In many cases, that's exactly what's happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=31.96s)]
*  On the day he returned to power, Donald Trump called the January the 6th prisoners hostages, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  which they aren't. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  And here at the White House, he pardoned almost all of them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Others had their sentences commuted, which means they'll be released, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=45.64s)]
*  but their convictions remain on the record. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=50.2s)]
*  One of them is Stuart Rhodes, founder of the far-right militia group, the Oath Keepers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=52.96s)]
*  He received 18 years for trying to overthrow the government. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Another is Jacob Chansley, whose image became closely associated with the riot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=61.28s)]
*  I got the news from my lawyer when I was at the gym and I walked outside [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=67.0s)]
*  and I screamed freedom at the top of my lungs and then gave a good Native American war cry. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=71.76s)]
*  Then there's the former leader of the far-right group, the Proud Boys. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=78.08s)]
*  Henry Enrique Tario was serving 22 years, also for planning to overthrow the government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=81.84s)]
*  He's received a full pardon. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=88.08s)]
*  And since his release, he's claimed they didn't care about the evidence, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=90.36s)]
*  they cared about putting Trump supporters in prison. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=93.56s)]
*  Well, now it's our turn, he said, adding the people who did this, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=96.52s)]
*  they need to feel the heat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=100.52s)]
*  They need to be put behind bars. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=102.0s)]
*  Many others involved have been pardoned too, and the outrage from some is palpable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=104.96s)]
*  One police officer who was attacked on January 6th says, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=111.0s)]
*  I have been betrayed by my country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=113.88s)]
*  The biggest police union, which endorsed Trump during the election, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  said the pardon sent a dangerous message. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=119.24s)]
*  And one legal analyst says that the move corrupts the rule of law and rewrites history. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  But to Donald Trump, the January 6th convictions are an example of how, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  in his eyes, the justice system isn't working [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=130.92s)]
*  and has been used to attack him and his supporters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=134.0s)]
*  On January 6th itself, we heard a similar message, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  that America's democracy wasn't working. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=141.0s)]
*  Donald Trump came here, to the ellipse, with the White House behind him, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=144.04s)]
*  and as the certification of his defeat loomed, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  he told supporters to peacefully and patriotically make their voices heard. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=151.48s)]
*  He also said this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  And we fight. We fight like hell. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=162.56s)]
*  After the speech, the crowd, hundreds and hundreds strong, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=166.64s)]
*  moved towards the Capitol. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  As they walked, Trump supporters shouted, stop the steal, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=172.68s)]
*  echoing his false claim that the election had been stolen, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=176.64s)]
*  a claim he's repeated since returning to the presidency. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=180.24s)]
*  Soon enough, the crowd would reach its destination [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=184.4s)]
*  and force its way into the Capitol. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=188.44s)]
*  The building they attacked is the building where, four years later, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=191.88s)]
*  their man, Donald Trump, was again sworn in as president, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=195.2s)]
*  and where, hours before their pardons, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=198.96s)]
*  he'd emphasised the importance of law and order. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=201.2s)]
*  But only in certain circumstances, it seems. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=205.72s)]
*  Last year, Donald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=208.44s)]
*  of falsifying business records. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=212.16s)]
*  And the man who led US government investigations into him [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=214.48s)]
*  believes that, if he hadn't been re-elected, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  the volume of evidence means Donald Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=219.56s)]
*  would have been convicted of election interference too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=221.8s)]
*  Donald Trump dismisses such claims. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=225.04s)]
*  He argues all the cases against him were politically motivated. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=227.12s)]
*  And for him, these January the 6th pardons reinforce his message [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=231.32s)]
*  that the justice system can be political and unjust. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=236.2s)]
*  It's a claim his critics fear will apply to him in his second term. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=241.28s)]
*  According to NPR, Trump himself has made more than 100 threats [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=244.96s)]
*  to prosecute or punish perceived enemies. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=248.64s)]
*  Across the road from the Capitol building is the Supreme Court, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  which recently gave presidents partial immunity [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  from criminal prosecution. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=257.68s)]
*  Law and politics have always, to some degree, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=259.68s)]
*  been intertwined in America, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=261.96s)]
*  but on the day that power changed hands, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  we saw the extent to which that's now the case. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=266.28s)]
*  In December, Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=269.32s)]
*  who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=272.32s)]
*  Then, minutes before he left office, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=275.4s)]
*  he pre-emptively pardoned a number of people, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  including other members of his family [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  and members of the House committee that investigated January the 6th. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=282.56s)]
*  He referenced concern about politically motivated prosecutions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=286.92s)]
*  Soon after, Vice President JD Vance was sworn in by Brett Kavanaugh, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=290.8s)]
*  one of three appointees to the Supreme Court chosen by Donald Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=295.0s)]
*  Later, the new president issued his January the 6th pardons. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=299.92s)]
*  After watching this play out, Politico reported that both presidents, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  on the same day, stretched the pardon power [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=308.32s)]
*  to new questionable frontiers in wildly different ways. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=310.76s)]
*  The following day, Ross Albrecht was also pardoned. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=315.88s)]
*  He operated a dark web marketplace called Silk Road, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=319.0s)]
*  and in 2015 was found guilty of charges, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=322.28s)]
*  including conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=324.44s)]
*  money laundering and computer hacking. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=326.64s)]
*  On this, Donald Trump posted, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=329.36s)]
*  he was given two life sentences plus 40 years. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=338.36s)]
*  Ridiculous, said the president. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=341.12s)]
*  And on his return to power, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=343.92s)]
*  there's one word that Donald Trump has been using a lot. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=345.24s)]
*  And I will win for you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=349.2s)]
*  We're going to win like never before. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=351.44s)]
*  Right now, Donald Trump is winning. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=354.8s)]
*  He's president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=356.96s)]
*  And his political success rests, in part, on a sense of grievance, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=358.4s)]
*  that America's institutions are against him and can't be trusted. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=362.2s)]
*  But with each attack on the justice system, with each pardon, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  faith in the fairness of American justice is being tested. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=370.56s)]
*  And the distinction between law and politics becomes harder to make out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEm8RoOYsRA&t=374.64s)]
