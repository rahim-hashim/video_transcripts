Video Description: Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced an "Easter truce'' in Ukraine, according to reports. 

The Russian Ministry of Defence released a statement confirming that Russia will stop all military operations from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) today until midnight on 21 April (22:00 BST).

The ministry says all military actions have been ordered to stop, adding that the decision was “guided by humanitarian considerations”.

They say they expect the Ukrainian side to do the same, but it is unclear whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accepted the terms of the truce.

# President Putin announces 'Easter truce' in Ukraine until end of Sunday | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0)
*  breaking news this hour. President Putin denounced an Easter truce in Ukraine. A statement from the Kremlin said all Russian forces would seize hostilities from 3pm GMT today, that's 4pm BST, and that the pause would last until the end of Sunday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=0.0s)]
*  So, Joe, of course, all of this is coming to us at the moment, only in the last hour or so we saw Vladimir Putin deliver that statement on Russian TV. First of all, let's break it all down, just tell us exactly what we know about this so far. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=17.4s)]
*  So this was, as you can see from the conversation between President Putin and Valery Gorasimov, a senior military man, they're having one of these rather stage-managed conversations in which President Putin essentially delivers a statement. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=42.2s)]
*  And what we know is that they've said they've declared a unilateral ceasefire for, as you say, for the Easter period. According to the statements we've seen, it's going to end, would start at 6pm local time and goes on until midnight tomorrow. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=55.0s)]
*  So we're looking at whatever, that's a fairly reasonable amount of time. And what they've said is there will be no fighting from the Russians in that period, but crucially they've said that they are going to stand ready to repel any attacks that come from the Ukrainian side. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=70.8s)]
*  I think the context to this that matters is that for the Russians, they will be quite keen to show, I think, that the Ukrainians are not acting in good faith, have not stuck to the ceasefire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=86.4s)]
*  The reason that this is all important is because of the talks that have been going on, and more importantly, the reaction that the Trump presidency have had to the possibility of peace. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=98.0s)]
*  President Trump came into power saying he was going to get this fixed in 24 hours, ceasefire in 24 hours, that obviously didn't happen. And obviously they've had another 100 days or so and they've still struggled to get nothing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=110.4s)]
*  And we've had these talks and at the end of them, Secretary of State Marco Rubio came out and said they would walk away if both sides were acting in bad faith or if either side was acting in bad faith. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=120.4s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised at all if what we see is this ceasefire declared and then accusations from the Russians that the Ukrainians have breached it because that will give them ammunition to say, look, they're not acting in good faith. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=131.0s)]
*  We are the ones trying to pursue a ceasefire. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=143.0s)]
*  No response as yet from the Ukrainians. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=144.8s)]
*  I thought it was interesting when I looked at this statement from Vladimir Putin or some of the comments that he was delivering alongside his military chief that he said based on humanitarian considerations, the Russian side's announced an Easter truce. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=149.8s)]
*  Yes, and I think that will be met with, shall we say, some skepticism in Kiev and in European capitals. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't think many people could accuse the Russians of acting with humanitarian considerations in all of this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=169.8s)]
*  Of course, that has always been one of the reasons that Russia gave for the starting this entire war was the humanitarian situation, specifically, they said, of Russian speaking people in the Donbass, something which has never really been, shall we say, internationally agreed upon that that was their consideration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=177.2s)]
*  And I think few people will think now that they are acting in humanitarian reasons. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know quite what they are thinking. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=201.4s)]
*  We don't know other than what they've said publicly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  But yes, I think that will be met with suspicion and disagreement in Kiev. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=206.8s)]
*  A question many of our viewers might be asking is why just an Easter truce? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=211.8s)]
*  I mean, is this a PR stunt by the Kremlin? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=215.8s)]
*  Could this lead to a longer truce in the long run? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=219.8s)]
*  I mean, of course, this is all conjecture at the moment. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=223.8s)]
*  But what's your analysis of that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=225.8s)]
*  I mean, I think the Russians have been very clear about the fact that they are going to have a ceasefire. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=227.8s)]

*  It was interesting listening to Sergey Markov, who's a Kremlin, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=393.8s)]
*  who's a Kremlin, a former member of the Duma and a Kremlin spokesperson, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=397.8s)]

*  but seen as someone who speaks from the Kremlin's perspective. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=404.8s)]
*  He was saying today that any European force, any NATO forces, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=405.8s)]
*  would be viewed as a hostile and invading force rather than a peacekeeping force. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=410.8s)]
*  He was calling for other nations not so closely aligned with Ukraine [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=414.8s)]
*  to be the ones that would lead any peacekeeping operations. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=418.8s)]
*  So I think there we are really, we'd be, should we say, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=421.8s)]
*  it's going to be difficult for this coalition of the willing as it's currently composed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=425.8s)]
*  And it is going to be the UK and France that would provide the manpower, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=429.8s)]
*  would be the ones who would give it some backbone. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=433.8s)]
*  Of course not as much backbone as the Americans would, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=436.8s)]
*  but we wouldn't, we're not expecting them to put any boots on the ground. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=438.8s)]
*  That force would be very, very, very difficult to get the Russians to accept that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=442.8s)]
*  as a legitimate peacekeeping force. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=447.8s)]
*  Just to say, Vladimir Putin said that his latest truce from Russia at least [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=449.8s)]
*  will show, I quote, how sincere, or question, how sincere the Kyiv regime's readiness, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=455.8s)]
*  its desire and ability to observe agreements and participate in a process of peace talk. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=461.8s)]
*  So in a way Vladimir Putin there saying, well, this is a test now, not on Russia, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=467.8s)]
*  but on Kyiv, but it is interesting as you touched on before, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=471.8s)]
*  but there have been previous attempts around Easter when it comes to holding ceasefires, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=475.8s)]
*  April 2022 and the Orthodox Christmas in January 2023, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=480.8s)]
*  but they didn't come to fruition because both sides failed to agree. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=485.8s)]
*  So is it possible that we could be talking in a couple of hours and saying, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=489.8s)]
*  well, actually, this is only a one-sided ceasefire? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=492.8s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that the point that Vladimir Putin makes there in a way backs up [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=494.8s)]
*  or agrees with the point I made at the start that it is quite possible that the Russians will be using this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=500.8s)]
*  I mean, this is conjecture at this point, of course. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=506.8s)]
*  This is only just spoken, but it's quite possible the Russians would use this as an opportunity [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=508.8s)]
*  to try and make the case, and there's the audience that they're looking at making this case to, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=512.8s)]
*  is the White House, that the Ukrainians are not partners in peace, as they would put it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=516.8s)]
*  Of course, the Ukrainians would completely dispute that, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=522.8s)]
*  but they might use this by saying, we declare a unilateral ceasefire. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=524.8s)]
*  They can then, it gives them an opportunity to accuse the Ukrainians of breaching something, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=528.8s)]
*  whether or not they do, because that, if they can make the case to the Americans [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=533.8s)]
*  that the Ukrainians have not gone along with this ceasefire, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=538.8s)]
*  well, that makes it more likely that the Americans will wash saying, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=541.8s)]
*  a pox in all your houses and walk away from this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=545.8s)]
*  And in a way, if that happened, if the Russians were able to get the Americans [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=547.8s)]
*  to pull out of anything, any attempts at peace, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=551.8s)]
*  well, that would be to Moscow's advantage and to Kiev's very significant disadvantage. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=554.8s)]
*  Okay, Joanne Wood. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHfcRFp4O0&t=558.8s)]
