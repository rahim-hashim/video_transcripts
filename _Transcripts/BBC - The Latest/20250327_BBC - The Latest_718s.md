# Analysis: Did Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese change women's basketball? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k)
*  The WNBA has been around for a while. The Women's Championship has been around for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=0.0s)]
*  You've covered the sport, you played for Georgetown. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=5.34s)]
*  How do you account for what happened last year when suddenly as many Americans were watching the women's college basketball as they were [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=8.78s)]
*  watching the men's? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=16.6s)]
*  Honestly, Katty, I would venture to say that more folks were watching the women's tournament than the men's ultimately. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=18.78s)]
*  It's a combination of a lot of things as I reflect on my experience as a women's basketball player and now as a member of the media. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=24.82s)]
*  The one thing that comes to mind is the star power of last year's crew. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=30.9s)]
*  I mean, Caitlin Clark, household name, Angel Reese now also a household name. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=35.86s)]
*  And so you had this wonderful culmination of incredibly talented young women that were also marketable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=40.08s)]
*  And finally, you add in the timing of the NIL stuff. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  The marketing dollars matched the talent and met the passion and the fervor for fans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=52.26s)]
*  Now, I will add the additional layer and some folks may want to argue about this, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  but based on my lived experience in this country, the Larry Bird Magic Johnson effect of it all, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=61.3s)]
*  that is to speak of the two representations of two different worlds when you talk about Iowa and LSU, it's a culminating [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  ingredient in how we get to this big-time moment that crosses into mainstream sports conversation in a way that women's sports had not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=74.02s)]
*  often prior to that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  I interviewed Magic Johnson not long after in about early last summer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=82.22s)]
*  And I asked him about the phenomenon of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese and had they really changed the game for good? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=87.1s)]
*  They changed the whole business model. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=93.82s)]
*  I mean, that was what he was interested in. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=95.38s)]
*  I was interested in. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=96.78s)]
*  Did this mean going forward, there would always be just as many people watching women's college basketball as there would be watching [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  men's college basketball in the kinds of numbers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  And he sounded pretty confident at the time that, yes, I mean, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=107.74s)]
*  the whole country was caught up in the fever of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=110.5s)]
*  But I'm wondering if that's true or was that was that a moment in time? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=113.34s)]
*  Like you say, there were these it was so personality driven. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=118.54s)]
*  And then I wonder how long can anything really be sustained if it depends on one or two personalities? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  Well, Gatti, and this is totally a fair question because I have discussed it with friends. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  I have thought about it endlessly myself. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=135.62s)]
*  Is this something that was a flash in the pan because of all of these different factors? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=137.82000000000002s)]
*  Right now, here's where I am on it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=141.5s)]
*  We'll have to wait until we get to April 6th this year to see what the numbers provide in terms of the viewership of the women's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  tournament this year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  But when I'm watching the Super Bowl and I see a Nike commercial that features Juju Watkins and Caitlin Clark and Asia Wilson, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  Jordan Childs and other women athletes, when I'm starting to see Flaugé pop up with Experian because she's helping to pay back [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=157.02s)]
*  debt in combination with the company of Forgive Co. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=164.66s)]
*  When I'm seeing a variety of young women, I mean, the Notre Dame women's team and an insurance commercial, like when I'm [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=167.58s)]
*  seeing women become more and more part of the actual mainstream experience of sport, I'm inclined to believe that we are, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=174.34s)]
*  in fact, seeing a change. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=183.74s)]
*  I do think that last year and this is me just having been in it and having lived in it, I do think last year will represent a spike, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  but I do not think we will go back to where we were either. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  I think from this point out, there are stars to attach your name and your fandom to, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  The Juju Watkins, the Paige Beckers, the Kiki Rice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=200.7s)]
*  There are a number of them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't know that we will have sort of the rivalry, whether you want to base that rivalry of Clark and Reese based on sport or on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  society or any of the other above, the two of them I happen to know have tremendous respect for one another. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=211.82s)]
*  Rivalry and clear sides is a part of why we love sport. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=217.3s)]
*  I don't know that we're going to have that, but I do think and I am confident that the women's game is growing and partly because the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=221.46s)]
*  marketing dollars are there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=228.3s)]
*  The money is there, Katty, and we know that where there's money, that's where people are putting their investment and showing their [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  interest. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=235.62s)]
*  I love the fact I was about to say only in America is the real barometer of success the fact that you're an insurance cat. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=235.9s)]
*  I mean, she made an insurance commercial. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=242.38000000000002s)]
*  What would you want? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=245.78s)]
*  Seriously, I mean, when you've got I mean, Angel Reese has a McDonald's ad, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  If you want to go, you go insurance and you go fast food here in the US, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=252.14s)]
*  That's how you show that you really arrived. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=255.1s)]
*  But I mean, you're seeing various women athletes representing various brands having different opportunities. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=257.06s)]
*  And to me, the marketing is only going to come when these companies believe that there's an advantage here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=263.94s)]
*  And even if you don't see an actual player, the other day I was watching a commercial for I believe it might have been a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  breast cancer drug here here in the States and the woman's journey, they show her in various chapters of her life. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  But one of the early scenes in the commercial is she's a basketball player. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=282.06s)]
*  And so this idea that women's sports is mainstream fabric and it's not about women, masculine or feminine, like women have sports [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=285.38s)]
*  experience and it becoming a part of our generic storytelling on a daily basis is all a byproduct of where we are when we look at the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  stars of the women's NCAA tournament. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=298.62s)]
*  That's super interesting. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=300.94s)]
*  So somehow women's sports has to become part of the story of our lives, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=302.14s)]
*  In a mainstream way. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=308.46s)]
*  And I love that example that you just said that somehow the fact that it showed up in an ad shows what we all know, which is all our [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=310.9s)]
*  girls are playing sports now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=319.74s)]
*  And so it becomes part of our lives. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  And that is that which makes it is it that that's going to make it long term commercially viable? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=323.78s)]
*  Two things. I think it has to show up in our storytelling and it has to be encouraged by our families. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=329.5s)]
*  Yeah, to me. Right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=334.58s)]
*  And so covering the WNBA this past season, Caitlin Clark's work a year for all of the conversation that surrounded her, some which was [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=335.78s)]
*  fair and some which wasn't. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=342.78s)]
*  The one thing that I cannot deny is the amount of little girls that were showing up to follow her little girls with their parents and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  the fervor and the energy there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=350.26s)]
*  Why her? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=351.62s)]
*  Well, I was just about to say same thing for Angel Reese when I had a chance to cover their games. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=352.42s)]
*  But I think Caitlin represented and again, some of this to me probably is not fair to her because it was not anything that she said or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=356.02s)]
*  was truly based on her personality. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=364.02s)]
*  But she was a white girl from the middle of America. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=366.02s)]
*  And so she represented a whole lot to a lot of people, whether that is truly what she prescribed to or not. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=367.94s)]
*  We can all say she is a dynamic basketball player and a force both on the court and the marketing sense. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=374.18s)]
*  But I do think same thing with folks that may have fallen in love with Angel Reese, that may or may not. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  She may or may not have agreed with everything they had to say either. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  We fall. We attach our fandom to these icons for all types of reasons. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=387.46s)]
*  And sometimes they may not be based on all truth. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=391.06s)]
*  What does it say for the health of the league or I don't know, for any support that it's depending so much on this idea of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=393.26s)]
*  personalities? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  That's an interesting question, Katty. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=405.26s)]
*  I think I would split that up into two conversations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=406.82s)]
*  We've got a women's college basketball conversation and we'd have a WNBA conversation. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=411.58s)]
*  As someone who also covers the NBA, part of what makes the LeBrons and the Stephen Currys so magnetic is being able to connect [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=417.05999999999995s)]
*  with them via social media, via their ads, via their foundations and their production companies, in addition to them being [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=429.58s)]
*  great players. And so I don't think that it's a detriment that folks want to be able to attach themselves because of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=435.94s)]
*  personalities. I am one who very much believes in celebrating an entire being. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=443.86s)]
*  And while my favorite athlete may be great on the court, if there's also something about who they are or how they show up that I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=447.98s)]
*  connect and resonate with, then fine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=454.1s)]
*  I'm inclined to spend my dollars on things that they represent. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=456.02s)]
*  And again, that ties all the way back to our marketing conversation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=458.54s)]
*  In women's college basketball, we're in a really unique time with the NIL. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=461.34s)]
*  Like for a lot of those college basketball players, that four years or maybe sometimes five is an important window for them to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  capitalize on their earning potential if they don't go on to go pro. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  So I don't think personality is ever coming out of college basketball. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=473.82s)]
*  And quite frankly, the WNBA now going into its 29th season, that connection with its true and purest fan, its longest fan, has [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=476.94s)]
*  always been there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=488.98s)]
*  And those fans have been willing to go out and seek it in the most niche and far fetched places to support the women in the league [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  that they love. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=496.14s)]
*  Now that it's becoming mainstream, I don't think that that's going to change. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=497.02s)]
*  The newer audience will have to decide if they want to continue to support as they get to know who these women are via their [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  personality, or do they just love the game? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=508.46s)]
*  Whichever reason it is, you're welcome to pull up and enjoy the product. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=510.58s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to go straight down the kind of gender question here, which is that I can see you're right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=513.74s)]
*  Thinking about it that men's sports and I look at the English Premier League, which my husband follows religiously and my kids [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=520.18s)]
*  follow religiously, being dominated right forever by personalities. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=526.26s)]
*  People love the people that they follow as the individuals as much as the teams. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=530.42s)]
*  I'm just wondering now whether there are just more it's there are more pitfalls for women in being maybe this is totally wrong. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=534.74s)]
*  Come on, say it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=544.06s)]
*  Big personalities, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=544.78s)]
*  We are just going to get tripped up every time we try to be that personality that has to carry the whole league on our back. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  We are that you know, there's going to be pitfall after pitfall after pitfall that we might fall into in a way that there isn't for men. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=552.06s)]
*  And that just makes it harder for us to be those big personalities and carry the sport with us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=559.18s)]
*  Katty, you are preaching. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=563.5s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=564.62s)]
*  And this is why that Nike commercial this year is to me so iconic, not just because of the powerful women that were in it, but the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=565.7399999999999s)]
*  message. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  The whole message is exactly what you just said. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  It's all this chatter that women have to deal with. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=575.38s)]
*  And I had a conversation last year that went somewhere viral kind of around the same idea, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=577.58s)]
*  We have to so delicately navigate our being as women, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=581.98s)]
*  And this Nike ad is all this chatter. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=585.46s)]
*  But the line for that ad hook line, sinker, final thing, period, full stop is you can't win. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=587.46s)]
*  So when and so to me, yes, you nailed it in that women have to navigate all these various pitfalls. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=594.86s)]
*  Are you too feminine? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  Are you too masculine? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=603.22s)]
*  How do you show up? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=604.5s)]
*  What do you represent? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=605.78s)]
*  Da da da da da. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=606.94s)]
*  But to whom much is given, much is required. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=608.06s)]
*  And I am enjoying an era of athlete that is not apologizing for who they are. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=610.82s)]
*  They will find the brands that align. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=616.02s)]
*  They will find the fans that align and they will go on about their business. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=619.22s)]
*  We all know if you don't want something, just leave it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=622.86s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=626.38s)]
*  So Monica, I guess the question now is how do we we got a whole load of people who are kind of peeking through the window. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=627.7s)]
*  They're interested. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=633.46s)]
*  How do we make sure they walk through the door and then stay? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=634.62s)]
*  Push them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=637.58s)]
*  I mean, you know, take that money. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=640.14s)]
*  Just come on. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=643.22s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=643.82s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=644.26s)]
*  You made your decision already. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=644.6600000000001s)]
*  I would like to believe. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=647.3000000000001s)]
*  And again, there were tons of conversations had last year coming off the women's NCAA tournament and during the WNBA season. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=649.4200000000001s)]
*  And I have heard that some felt alienated for being huge fans of Caitlin Clark. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=655.78s)]
*  I have heard that some were frustrated by fans of Caitlin Clark. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=660.82s)]
*  There's all sides of the coin in this thing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  And I only mentioned her name because she was one of the preeminent names of the sport, but she's not the only one. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  I would say that if you love the game of basketball, if you want to see someone that you resonate with for a number of reasons, they exist in women's college basketball or in the WNBA. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=672.5s)]
*  And so follow their products, follow their social accounts, find out more about them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=687.26s)]
*  But if you love the game of basketball, just stick around off of that and everything else will come. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=692.86s)]
*  Monica, thank you so much for joining me. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=697.98s)]
*  That was super interesting. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=700.58s)]
*  No problem. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=701.34s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRByTaxB6k&t=702.02s)]
