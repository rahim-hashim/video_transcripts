Video Description: Caster Semenya's right to a fair hearing was violated by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court when she lost a 2020 appeal against World Athletics regulations that effectively barred her from competing, Europe's top court has ruled.
 
The double 800m Olympic champion won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights in her long legal battle over athletics' sex eligibility rules.
 
Semenya, 34, was born with differences of sexual development (DSD) and has been unable to compete in the 800m since World Athletics brought in rules in 2019 restricting testosterone levels for track events from 400m up to the mile.
 
The South African middle distance runner believes World Athletics has shown discrimination against athletes with DSD by insisting they reduce testosterone levels in order to be eligible.
 
World Athletics declined to comment.

**BBC - The Latest:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo)
*  Thanks for staying with us. You're watching Focus on Africa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, double 800-metre Olympic champion, Kasta Semenya, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=3.2s)]
*  has won a partial victory today at the European Court of Human Rights [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=7.2s)]
*  in her long legal battle over athletic sex eligibility rules. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  The court ruled that the South African athlete had some of her rights to a fair hearing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=16.0s)]
*  violated at Switzerland's Supreme Court, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=20.2s)]
*  where she had appealed against a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=22.8s)]
*  regarding some of the world athletics regulations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=26.8s)]
*  However, the court failed to pronounce itself on the question of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=29.8s)]
*  Semenya's being discriminated against in Swiss courts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=33.0s)]
*  Semenya's case could now go back to the Swiss Federal Court in Lausanne. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=36.6s)]
*  Semenya was born with differences of sexual development [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=41.2s)]
*  and has been unable to compete in the 800 metres [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=44.0s)]
*  since world athletics brought in rules in 2019 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=46.6s)]
*  restricting testosterone levels for set-and-track events. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=49.8s)]
*  Well, I spoke to BBC reporter, Poonzafi Kalani, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  who's been following Semenya's story over the years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=56.0s)]
*  This is what she told me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=59.2s)]
*  It doesn't mean that she can compete again, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=61.0s)]
*  but what it does do is that it puts more pressure on sports bodies [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  to be more circumspect when they're setting regulations [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  and to have at the heart of those regulations [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  making sure that they don't violate human rights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=73.0s)]
*  Now, this is something that Kasta Semenya herself has said [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=76.2s)]
*  she sees as a win because the case for her was not about returning to the track, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  but was more about making sure that her dignity is respected, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=85.0s)]
*  that her rights are protected, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=88.8s)]
*  but also the rights of other athletes who have the same condition that she has. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=90.6s)]
*  And she has insistently said over the years [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  that she's being unfairly discriminated against over a condition [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=98.6s)]
*  she's got no control over. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=103.2s)]
*  She was born with this condition. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  She has been described as intersex, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=106.6s)]
*  and that means she's got higher testosterone levels than other women. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=109.8s)]
*  But she said, apart from that, she's done nothing wrong, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=114.6s)]
*  and she feels like for years she's been punished for the way that, quote, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  God had created her. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=121.0s)]
*  This has been going on for a long time now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=122.8s)]
*  I think it's since 2009 when she was first asked to undergo sex testing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=124.8s)]
*  How has this legal tassel, on-track tassel, affected her career? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=129.0s)]
*  Has she been up to even as she's had to navigate the courts in all this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=133.4s)]
*  You know, it's been very interesting watching Kasta over the years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=138.2s)]
*  I remember when she had that first win way back when, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=140.8s)]
*  when she came out as a teenager who came back home in South Africa [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=144.6s)]
*  and was celebrated for winning a gold medal at the Olympics, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  and how quickly that joy was stripped from her. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=151.8s)]
*  She has been media-shy for years, only rarely communicating with the media. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  But I remember a time when I went to go visit the village where she was from, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=159.6s)]
*  in Pulugwane, and her community was just stunned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=162.8s)]
*  They couldn't make sense of what was happening. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=165.6s)]
*  At the time, they were saying they feel that she's being discriminated against. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=167.8s)]
*  The sex tests that she'd been subjected to were the first they'd ever heard of such a thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=171.6s)]
*  Even the word intersex, they'd never heard of. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=176.6s)]
*  Kasta herself didn't know she had this condition until she was subjected to those tests. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=178.8s)]
*  So a lot of people over the years have said this is a young woman who had been robbed [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=183.8s)]
*  of a chance to enjoy her victory and enjoy a thriving international career. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IEKpOhtLHo&t=187.8s)]
