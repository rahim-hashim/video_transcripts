Video Description: For the Catholic Church, no aspect of Pope Francis' record is more sensitive or contentious than his handling of the sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy.
 
While he's widely acknowledged to have gone further than his predecessors in acknowledging victims and reforming the Church's own internal procedures, many survivors do not think he went far enough.
 
Alexa MacPherson's abuse by a Catholic priest began around the age of three and continued for six years. On discovering the abuse, her father called the police.
 
A court hearing for a criminal complaint against the priest, Peter Kanchong, accused of assault and battery of a minor, was set for 24 August 1984.
 
But unbeknownst to the family, something extraordinary was taking place behind the scenes. The Church – an institution that wielded enormous power in a deeply Catholic city – believed that the court was on its side.

*  the issue to global attention. Alexa McPherson's abuse by a Catholic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=32.72s)]
*  priest began, she tells me, at the age of three. When I was nine and a half my [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=40.16s)]
*  father caught him trying to rape me on the living room couch. For me it was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=46.28s)]
*  pretty much an everyday occurrence. The priest, Peter Kan Chong, seen here with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=52.120000000000005s)]

*  gave him one year's probation. But this letter from the then Archbishop of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=68.6s)]
*  Boston, Bernard Law, has since proved damning for the Church. The court was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=74.72s)]

*  recalled to Thailand. The document lay hidden for years. In 2002, Alexa was one [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=85.52s)]
*  of more than 500 victims of dozens of priests who forced the Boston Church to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  open its files. The landmark civil case brought the issue of systemic abuse to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  global attention by showing that time and again, Cardinal Law had simply moved [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=105.6s)]
*  the problem on. I did assign priests who had committed sexual abuse. The epidemic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=110.72s)]
*  of child sexual abuse here in Boston's church was uncovered long before [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=119.44s)]
*  Francis became Pope, but he has gone further than his predecessors in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=125.16s)]
*  acknowledging it, for the first time formally allowing the church authorities [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=129.76s)]
*  to share what they know with the civil courts. But there's still no requirement [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=134.2s)]
*  that they do so in every case, and survivors of the abuse say that he has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=139.16s)]
*  allowed a culture of cover-up and secrecy to continue. We ask forgiveness [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=144.0s)]
*  for our sins. In 2019, he summoned more than a hundred bishops to Rome for a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=150.04s)]
*  conference on the crisis. In the abuse of children, he said, we see the hand of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=156.92s)]
*  evil. For Alexa though, the Pope failed to match those words with enough [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=162.76s)]
*  meaningful action. What was your reaction to hearing about the Pope's death? I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=169.0s)]
*  actually don't feel like I had much of a reaction. I don't think enough has [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=174.88s)]
*  changed. There's just so much more that the church and the Vatican and the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  people in charge can do, and one of the biggest things is turning over [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=185.6s)]
*  predatory priests and the people who covered it up and holding them [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=190.16s)]
*  accountable in a regular court of law and not shielding them and hiding them [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=194.2s)]
*  any longer. As the world weighs a complex legacy for victims, the focus is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=199.8s)]
*  on whether the next Pope may be persuaded to go further in protecting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=206.72s)]
*  future childhoods from harm. I don't really like to look in that direction. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=211.04s)]
*  Alexa still lives within sight of the parish where hers was shattered. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=216.76s)]
*  John Sudworth, BBC News, Boston. And a reminder, we will have full coverage of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  the papal conclave here on BBC News. My colleague Marion Masheri will be in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=228.44s)]
*  Rome tomorrow as those 135 cardinals from across the world meet at the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=232.6s)]
*  Vatican to elect the next Pope. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0B_O2xTMwY&t=238.16s)]
