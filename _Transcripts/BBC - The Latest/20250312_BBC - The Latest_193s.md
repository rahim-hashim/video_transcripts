*  Baloch rebels are using civilians as human shields. There are reports that some hostages have been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=12.48s)]
*  taken away into the mountains. The information trickling out is tightly controlled and the BBC [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=18.32s)]
*  hasn't been able to independently verify it. A separatist militant group called the Baloch [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=24.0s)]
*  Liberation Army has claimed that it carried out the attack. The Jaffa Express was carrying more [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=29.52s)]
*  than 400 people when armed men blew up the tracks and opened fire. Train operations in the area have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=35.04s)]
*  been suspended according to officials. Well here's one of the hostages who was released. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=40.8s)]
*  People were screaming and crying. Everybody laid down on the ground including us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=47.6s)]
*  There were gunshots and explosions and after that the militants told us to come out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=53.28s)]
*  We were reluctant at first but we got out anyway. They let us go, all of us, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=58.96s)]
*  including my wife and children. They told us don't look back, just leave. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=66.0s)]
*  Well our Pakistan correspondent Azadeh Mashiri gave us this update a little earlier. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=73.6s)]
*  The incident has taken place in an extremely remote area. There's very limited mobile phone [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=79.12s)]
*  service so that's why even families are having a lot of difficulty reaching those who are still [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=85.12s)]
*  being held on this train. But we do have some information that's trickling out even though [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=90.08s)]
*  it's very tightly controlled and difficult for us to independently verify. Security sources are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  saying that now 190 people have been freed. They're also saying that 30 militants have now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  been killed. What the BBC has seen in the area at the Quetta railway station is about 90 wooden [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=108.0s)]
*  coffins being loaded onto a train and officials have said that about 130 more empty coffins are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=115.52s)]
*  being prepared to transport to the scene of the incident for any possible casualties. Now of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=121.28s)]
*  course this is an active situation. The Baloch Liberation Army has said that it is still in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=128.8s)]
*  control of the train and they have threatened those on board. What can you tell us about the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=133.92s)]
*  activity of the Baloch Liberation Army? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  Well they're behind many deadly incidents in the province and they as well as several other [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=146.64s)]
*  separatist militant groups in Balochistan are calling for independence. They accuse the central [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  government of exploiting the rich resources in Balochistan because even though it's the least [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=158.72s)]
*  developed province in Pakistan it has many natural resources, gas, minerals and in fact it's an area [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=164.16s)]
*  that's very important to China as well. China has a multi-billion dollar project there called the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=170.72s)]
*  China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and yet we're not talking about attacks on vehicles or on buses. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  We're now talking about an attack on a train that had hundreds of passengers on board so it's an [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=182.72s)]
*  escalation of their activity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8HtLUa0I&t=188.64s)]
