Video Description: The Israeli military has said an "operational misunderstanding" led to the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month.
 
An inquiry into the incident by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found a series of failings. It said the killing of a UN worker shortly afterwards was "a breach of orders during a combat setting".
 
It added that the deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed "for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief".
 
Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military.

# 'Operational misunderstanding' led to killing of Gaza medics, IDF inquiry says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk)
*  An Israeli military inquiry into the Israel Defense Forces killing of 15 paramedics and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=0.0s)]
*  aid workers in southern Gaza last month has found that there were several professional [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=6.76s)]
*  failures, breaches of orders and a failure to fully report the incident. But in its conclusion [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=11.92s)]
*  of its inquiry, the Israeli military said it found no evidence of execution. Well, this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=18.2s)]
*  is the video from the incident. It was obtained from the mobile phone of one of the medics [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=24.52s)]
*  who was killed and it was given to the New York Times newspaper. And that video being [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=30.96s)]
*  made public forced the Israeli army to admit that its initial account claiming that the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=36.36s)]
*  vehicles approached without lights was in fact untrue. Well, the Israeli army's inquiry [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=41.72s)]
*  says troops did not use indiscriminate fire in the incident. It said a deputy commander [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=48.2s)]
*  will be dismissed from his position. Well, the Palestine Red Crescent Society and others [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  have been calling for an independent international investigation. Well, let's get the latest [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=59.96s)]
*  on that breaking news by going straight to Jerusalem and joining my colleague, Gary O'Donoghue, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=66.16s)]
*  who is there. Gary, just tell us more about what we know from the Israeli military and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=71.72s)]
*  this internal investigation. Well, I think we're seeing in this report that the Israeli [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=77.88s)]
*  army has come some distance from its initial description of what happened a week after [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  the incident at the end of March. But even given that, it's still saying that this was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  in a sense an operational misunderstanding in terms of the deaths of the 14 medics and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  civil defence workers. In terms of the killing of the UN worker, they're saying that was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=102.4s)]
*  a breach of orders and they are dismissing, as you said, the battalion, the deputy battalion [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=109.2s)]
*  commander from the Galani brigade there. So that is unusual for the Israeli army to actually [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  dismiss someone, but that is a field commander on the ground. What else? In terms of further [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  up the command chain, it's a reprimand for the brigade commander himself. I think there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=125.1s)]
*  are still a lot of unanswered questions. Firstly, of course, people will say, look, these vehicles [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=132.1s)]
*  were approaching rapidly. There were lots of people jumping out of them. Well, that's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  kind of what happens with ambulances and fire trucks, right, when they get to an incident. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=142.38s)]
*  And we already know, of course, that from earlier video evidence that these ambulances [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=146.82s)]
*  did have their lights on, did have their emergency signals on. And so this description of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=152.4s)]
*  commander not being able, because of night visibility or problems with visibility at [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=159.44s)]
*  night to identify them, that raises questions. Also, I think they are now continuing to assert [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=163.96s)]
*  that six of those who died, six of the 14 ambulance workers and civil defence workers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=171.28s)]
*  were retrospectively, as they put it, identified as members of Hamas. Now, they have not produced [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=177.12s)]
*  any evidence for that. The names of all those ambulance workers and civil defence workers [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=182.68s)]
*  are in the public domain, so they could identify which ones they believe to be Hamas, and then [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=188.56s)]
*  people could go off and find out whether or not that was true or not. It's worth also [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=193.52s)]
*  pointing out, I think, that the IDF has already acknowledged that all of those who died were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=198.96s)]
*  unarmed at this point in time. It does say, of course, and there has been evidence for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=204.42s)]
*  this in the past, that Hamas has used medical vehicles to transport fighters at times. We [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=209.61999999999998s)]
*  know it's also used hospitals and schools at times to base some of its operations, some [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  of its staff, some of its structures, if you like, its control structures. But I think [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=221.38s)]
*  this does really mark a bit of a low point for the Israeli army in terms of this incident, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=228.33999999999997s)]
*  because this is one of the bloodiest involving the killing of medical workers specifically [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=234.22s)]
*  and rescue workers, if you like, during this whole war. And, Gary, I spoke to the Palestine [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=239.94s)]
*  Red Crescent after this all happened, and they were adamant that they wanted an independent [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  investigation. I'm assuming we don't yet have reaction from them, but I'm guessing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=253.74s)]
*  that this is unlikely to satisfy those who were calling for an independent investigation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=260.2s)]
*  I think that's certain to be the case. I think it's worth also pointing out, of course, that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=267.52s)]
*  the PRCS, the Red Crescent Society, there were some initial assertions from then that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=272.8s)]
*  these men may have been bound before they were killed. Now, there doesn't seem to be [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=279.12s)]
*  any evidence of that. The Israeli army is denying that, and the autopsies that were [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=286.8s)]
*  carried out by Hamas health officials, the forensic examiners on the ground subsequent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=291.08s)]
*  to that have not found any evidence of that. So that is one thing I think Israel is stressing, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=297.92s)]
*  and certainly stresses very close to the top of the reports or the parts of the report [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=303.4s)]
*  we have seen. But you're right, of course. They will say, look, these men were unarmed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=308.36s)]
*  They were behaving like ambulances because they were ambulances, and you've not explained [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=314.96s)]
*  how this misidentification could take place. It's also worth saying, I think, the report [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=321.12s)]
*  is suggesting that this is a combat zone. Now, Gaza is a combat zone, clearly, but there [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=328.24s)]
*  are clear designations at times for specific areas. And from what I can see in this initial [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=332.2s)]
*  look through, the IDF does not seem to be claiming that this was specifically one of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=339.4s)]
*  these red zones at the moment where you have to get permission to move around. Now, we'll [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  check that, of course, but from what I can see initially, that's not being claimed by [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=350.2s)]
*  the IDF. So if that is true, if I'm right about that, then the ambulances and the civil [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=355.32s)]
*  defence people were moving around in that sense legitimately or without the kind of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=361.68s)]
*  restrictions that Israel and the IDF imposes on them. And, Gary, we were showing on the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=368.68s)]
*  screen a few seconds ago the video of the incident, which, of course, was pivotal, really, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  in terms of uncovering what exactly happened. Yeah, this was a really distressing video, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=380.8s)]
*  I think you'd have to say. It was found on the phone of a man called Rafat Radwan. He [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=389.24s)]
*  was one of those who died. He was in one of the second batch of ambulances that were [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  sent out to find some of their colleagues who were by the side of the road in the first [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  ambulance. And there's quite a lot of time where you hear him praying, you hear him aware, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=406.68s)]
*  I think, that he's going to die. And, of course, that is the video that emerged, what, ten [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=415.68s)]
*  days ago, two weeks ago perhaps, no, just ten days ago now, which shows us that these [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=423.16s)]
*  ambulances did have their lights on, did have their emergency signals on, which, of course, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=428.68s)]
*  the IDF had claimed they did not when they gave their first explanation of what had happened. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=433.52s)]
*  And I think that's really, that video really forced the hand of the Israeli defence forces [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=440.0s)]
*  to come up with a much fuller explanation than they sometimes do in these circumstances. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=447.08s)]
*  And I think that's why you're seeing some disciplinary action, a promise to learn some [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=453.08s)]
*  lessons, an expression of what they call regret for the harm for uninvolved civilians. I think [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=460.08s)]
*  some people will think that is somewhat of an understatement of what took place. But, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=470.28s)]
*  yeah, I don't think this is going to go away in any sense at this point in time and the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=476.48s)]
*  pressure will be kept up. Meanwhile, of course, civilians, dozens of civilians each day in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=481.44s)]
*  Gaza are dying and the humanitarian situation is getting much worse according to the various [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=488.48s)]
*  agencies that work there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_w1BUioNKk&t=496.44s)]
