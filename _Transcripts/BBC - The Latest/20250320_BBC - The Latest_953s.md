Video Description: Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, BBC Eye has found.
 
Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these oil-polluted sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.
 
The BBC World Service has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times in the past five years. Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.

# Oil giant's leaked data reveals 'awful' pollution | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c)
*  My grandparents taught me to take care of the river since I was a child. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=0.0s)]
*  I have always had that love for the river in my heart and I lived close by. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=15.0s)]
*  Nearly a thousand miles long, the River Magdalena is Colombia's lifeblood. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=21.0s)]
*  But endangered animals are dying. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=29.0s)]
*  It's very sad to see the massacre of all the fauna that die here repeatedly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, a whistleblower shares evidence with BBC Eye that Colombia's biggest oil company has polluted the river and its wetlands. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=41.0s)]
*  For me, the breaking point was really looking at the people, the people that live next to this, really living the impacts of this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=50.0s)]
*  And we expose the price of speaking out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=61.0s)]
*  These are the wetlands of the River Magdalena. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=80.0s)]
*  It's a richly biodiverse area. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=95.0s)]
*  The region is also home to Ecopetrol's main base in Colombia, in the city of Barrancabamera. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=100.0s)]
*  Oil from across the nation is processed here in the country's largest oil refinery. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=107.0s)]
*  Andres Alarte grew up here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=113.0s)]
*  Getting the job at Ecopetrol was a dream come true. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=116.0s)]
*  I was extremely proud. My family was super proud as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=120.0s)]
*  Ecopetrol is Colombia's biggest oil company. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=125.0s)]
*  Its majority owned by the government and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=129.0s)]
*  Andres joined in 2017 and worked as an advisor to the CEO. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=134.0s)]
*  But he soon became concerned about the company's approach to the environment. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=140.0s)]
*  I remember doing some analysis of water discharges and it was awful. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=145.0s)]
*  Most of the water that is put there is really outside the norm of water quality regulation in Colombia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=153.0s)]
*  This has a lot of health implications for the communities and the people that use this water downstream. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=162.0s)]
*  As a community of fishermen, we are guardians of the rivers and the sparrows. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=170.0s)]
*  Because of this, we can bring food to our homes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=178.0s)]
*  I am Julia Andrea Velasquez. I am a fisherman and I belong to the community of San Juan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=185.0s)]
*  I am Julia Andrea Velasquez. I am a fisherman and I belong to the San Tander Fishermen's Federation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=194.0s)]
*  I am the president. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=203.0s)]
*  Julia and her colleagues have been raising the alarm about a disturbing trend. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=206.0s)]
*  It is very sad to see the massacre of all the fauna that repeatedly dies here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=212.0s)]
*  We found three manatees, five dead buffaloes, more than ten gulls, turtles, chihuahuas, birds, and thousands of dead fish. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=219.0s)]
*  So it is strange what is happening here in this canal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=237.0s)]
*  It is not clear what is causing the deaths. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=242.0s)]
*  River warming due to climate change could be a factor, but the fishers are concerned by signs of oil pollution. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=245.0s)]
*  Here we can observe the shine of this vegetable material and the oil that is here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=253.0s)]
*  All of this is pure oil and waste from the refinery and the oil industry. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=260.0s)]
*  The [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=283.0s)]
*  But as Andres continued at Ecopetro in 2018, he gained access to confidential evidence that wastewater pollution was not the only problem. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=286.56s)]
*  There is a database that could only be accessed at the very senior level. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=298.0s)]
*  I was able to access these databases because of the role I had. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=303.0s)]
*  Andres shared this data with the NGO Environmental Investigation Agency and then with the BBC. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=309.0s)]
*  The BBC has verified that the data came from Ecopetro's servers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=315.0s)]
*  In one database, the company records thousands of violations of Colombia's environmental laws and regulations. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=320.0s)]
*  Everything related to environment, air, methane emissions, water contamination, deforestation, etc. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=328.0s)]
*  Another database records 839 sites polluted with oil, some not fully cleaned up after a decade or more. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=337.0s)]
*  You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=347.0s)]
*  which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=356.0s)]
*  About 20% of the sites are marked as being only known to Ecopetro. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=361.0s)]
*  The BBC was able to film at one of these sites seven years later. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=367.0s)]
*  By Colombian law, you need to report environmental impact to the authority immediately. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=373.0s)]
*  Like if I spill something, I have to report it right away. That's part of every regulation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=379.0s)]
*  I was handing all the info to my superior saying, these are the results. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=388.0s)]
*  Isn't this really wrong? Isn't this illegal? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=395.0s)]
*  But then those questions would trigger not only this reaction of like, you're not getting this, you're not getting what the job is about. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=400.0s)]
*  Why are you asking these questions? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=410.0s)]
*  Felipe Baizon was CEO of Ecopetrol from 2017 to 2023. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=414.0s)]
*  It was during this time that Andres collected most of his data while working for the Vice President of Sustainability. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=423.0s)]
*  Baizon denies there was a policy of hiding unresolved oil pollution. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=431.0s)]
*  I have a good memory and I don't remember seeing the document. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=437.0s)]
*  That's why I say with absolute tranquility that there was no policy or instruction saying, these things cannot be told. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=442.0s)]
*  If there was something like this, it clearly does not obey an instruction from the company's top management. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=453.0s)]
*  Ecopetrol found out Andres was collecting information. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=467.0s)]
*  He left the company in 2019. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=473.0s)]
*  Shortly after, he started receiving anonymous death threats. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=476.0s)]
*  He doesn't know who was behind them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=480.0s)]
*  I had to leave Colombia because I couldn't walk the streets anymore. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=483.0s)]
*  I was afraid of being murdered or that my family would be murdered. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=487.0s)]
*  In Colombia, there are very organized crimes, thanks to the history we have. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=492.0s)]
*  If you look at the history of people who have been murdered, many of them were opposing Ecopetrol and the oil industry. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=497.0s)]
*  An armed conflict between left-wing guerrilla groups, the government and right-wing paramilitaries has been fought against. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=514.0s)]
*  The left-wing paramilitaries has been fought in Colombia for more than six decades. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=521.0s)]
*  Matt Smith is an oil analyst and financial journalist who has been based in Colombia for 14 years. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=530.0s)]
*  He has reported how the oil industry in Barrancabamera became a flashpoint in the conflict. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=538.0s)]
*  Colombia's oil industry has for decades been entangled in the armed conflict. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=545.0s)]
*  Despite an ongoing peace process, illegal armed groups remain active in the country. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=550.0s)]
*  Many former paramilitaries find employment with private security companies. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=556.0s)]
*  The overlap between private security companies and paramilitaries or former paramilitaries is immense. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=561.0s)]
*  And then the problem you have is those private security companies seek out the most lucrative contracts. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=568.0s)]
*  Most lucrative contracts tend to be the oil industry and tends to be Ecopetrol, providing most of those contracts. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=574.0s)]
*  Andres has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018 it paid a total of US$65 million to more than 2,800 private security companies. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=582.0s)]
*  I would honestly put my hand on my heart and say that senior management within Ecopetrol would not have been involved in ordering those paramilitaries to their facilities or near their facilities in 2021 onwards. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=595.0s)]
*  But there is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ and their desire to continually maintain their contract. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=609.0s)]
*  It could include potentially even kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders operating in those areas, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=619.0s)]
*  simply to get rid of the problem and ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=629.0s)]
*  Today, Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental activists. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=636.0s)]
*  Based on data from NGO Global Witness, a record 79 were killed in 2023. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=644.0s)]
*  Julie, leader of the fishing union, has also received death threats after speaking out against Ecopetrol. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=651.0s)]
*  In total, the BBC has spoken to nine people who have criticised Ecopetrol and later received death threats from illegal armed groups or anonymously. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=674.0s)]
*  Jubelis Morales is one of them. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=686.0s)]
*  Jubelis grew up in a fishing town downriver from Barrancabameja. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=704.0s)]
*  Aged 18, she led protests against Ecopetrol's plans to start fracking in her area. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=710.0s)]
*  Fracking in Colombia is not going to be given up, because it is not a fight against fracking. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=718.0s)]
*  It is a fight for everyone's lives. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=726.0s)]
*  Her protests soon attracted unwanted attention. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=731.0s)]
*  At night, two armed men came into my house, without a word. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=735.0s)]
*  They touched my hair in a disgusting, disgusting way. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=740.0s)]
*  They said, you are very pretty, it would be a shame if something happened to you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=747.0s)]
*  I said, fuck that, fracking, we are going to kill you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=753.0s)]
*  I stayed like that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=757.0s)]
*  They showed me that they could do anything to me. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=765.0s)]
*  I was not going to do anything, I couldn't do anything. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=770.0s)]
*  There were two types of people. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=774.0s)]
*  First, I would say that I do believe that we had the right to life, the right to control ourselves, with all the security companies. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=780.0s)]
*  And when something happened that was outside the standard, outside the regulations, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=790.0s)]
*  we were, with the expectations of the company's code of ethics and compliance, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=797.0s)]
*  we were the first to report this to the authorities. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=804.0s)]
*  I categorically reject those threats. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=820.0s)]
*  And I want to make it clear in this space that there was never and at no time, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=823.0s)]
*  there was no directive in that sense. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=830.0s)]
*  In fact, I have been very vocal in terms of ending the polarization that the country has, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=833.0s)]
*  of ending those enemies that do not lead us to anything. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=841.0s)]
*  From exile in Germany, Andres has built a new career working on climate policies. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=851.0s)]
*  I never realized how this would completely change my life, like in every sense, professionally, emotionally. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=858.0s)]
*  But I did this in the defense of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=871.0s)]
*  We are facing right now a huge problem that is climate change. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=880.0s)]
*  And maybe it's the time to rethink how to do energy, how to do oil in the country. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=885.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=900.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=903.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=906.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=909.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=912.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=915.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=918.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=921.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way to go. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=924.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdMLaTZG3c&t=927.0s)]
