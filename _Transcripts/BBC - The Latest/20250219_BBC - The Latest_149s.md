Video Description: Rapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.

A jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.

Terell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.

Mr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.

**BBC - The Latest:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE)
*  The rapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty in a gun assault trial in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=0.0s)]
*  The artist, whose real name is Rakim Myers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in Hollywood. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Authorities say A$AP Rocky, who is the partner of the singer Rihanna, got into a heated discussion with a former friend that turned violent, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=14.4s)]
*  leading to him pulling out a gun and opening fire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=22.2s)]
*  Emma Vardy is following the trial and told us more. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=25.6s)]
*  This trial was all about a falling out between two former school friends. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Rihanna's husband, the rapper known as A$AP Rocky, his real name Rakim Myers, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  and another member of their rap-hop collective known as A$AP Relly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=38.8s)]
*  And these two men had had a dispute one night in Hollywood, just yards away from the famous Walk of Fame. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=44.2s)]
*  And during that dispute, A$AP Rocky is alleged to have pulled out a gun and fired shots at A$AP Relly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=51.2s)]
*  Now A$AP Rocky, Rihanna's husband, had always denied this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=58.6s)]
*  He was seen on CCTV with a weapon, but his defence was that this wasn't a real gun, that it was a prop gun, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=62.2s)]
*  just something that he carried for security and was never able to fire shots. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=68.6s)]
*  But these two men ended up opposite each other in court with different versions of the same story. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=73.0s)]
*  And a lot was at stake for Rihanna's husband A$AP Rocky, because had he been found guilty, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=79.0s)]
*  he could have been facing more than 20 years in jail. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=85.0s)]
*  Now, like any celebrity trial, it made headlines as much for the characters involved, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=88.6s)]
*  as much as the criminal charges at stake. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=93.4s)]
*  And Rihanna, a musical megastar, well she'd been coming to court on multiple days to support her husband, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=96.6s)]
*  and one of those days she brought their two young children into court, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=102.6s)]
*  a one and two year old who came into the courtroom and sat remarkably quietly while this trial was going on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=105.8s)]
*  So it was very high profile, it'd been making a lot of headlines, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  the people watching this celebrity trial play out, and we got that not guilty verdict today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=115.0s)]
*  In dramatic fashion, in fact, as soon as it was read out, Rihanna's husband A$AP Rocky, the rapper, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=120.2s)]
*  well he jumped up from the desk he was at, he essentially fell into the public gallery, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=126.2s)]
*  embracing people in celebration at his not guilty verdict. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=131.4s)]
*  So a pretty dramatic day in court, a huge falling out between these two rappers, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=135.8s)]
*  but it's ended up in freedom for A$AP Rocky and Rihanna and their family, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=140.6s)]
*  something that could have been life changing for them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT9Ntx6XHE&t=145.8s)]
