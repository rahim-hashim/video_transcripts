Video Description: A huge sinkhole in a street in Surrey, UK, is continuing to grow and swallow up more road, with the county council declaring a major incident.
 
The original hole first appeared in the street late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.
 
A second opening has now appeared, with a car teetering on the brink and the owner unable to move it.
 
Families have been evacuated from their homes over fears of an explosion caused by exposed cables, with one resident saying the street now "sounded like a waterfall".

*  to move it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=22.62s)]
*  Those houses were built quite recently and somebody who lives here who was aware of what [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=25.56s)]
*  was going on actually owns a business nearby said that whenever he had tried to develop [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=31.36s)]
*  his business and do anything with the ground, he was told it was very difficult because [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=36.8s)]
*  of the network of sand mines that runs all the way through this area. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=40.68s)]
*  Very well known local people say when they were children they went on school trips to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=44.44s)]
*  go and look at them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=49.08s)]
*  And people have reported holes appearing in this road over the last year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=50.56s)]
*  I've been shown a picture from one from 2019, very much close to where this large [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=55.24s)]
*  sinkhole has opened up. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  But it happened very quickly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=62.36s)]
*  It happened pretty much overnight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=64.22s)]
*  The holes appeared, two of them actually, on two sides of the road. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=66.48s)]
*  Water mains were ruptured. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=70.4s)]
*  A third hole had to be dug by the water company to cap off the water so that there wouldn't [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=71.84s)]
*  be further flooding. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=77.86s)]
*  People in this area had no water for quite a few hours. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=79.4s)]
*  It has come back on for which they're very grateful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=82.44s)]
*  And then the problem of the people who live in areas near the hole, there was an early [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=85.36s)]
*  concern. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=89.52s)]
*  There might be some sort of an explosion. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=90.52s)]
*  So 30 residents, people asked to leave their homes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Some have gone to hotels, some have gone to friends. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=96.44s)]
*  There have been problems finding places for pets. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=98.6s)]
*  Children are in local schools, of course, so they can't go too far. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=101.9s)]
*  And I'm told, because I've spoken to one resident who still doesn't know where her family is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=105.28s)]
*  going to end up tonight, because insurance companies are not being terribly helpful, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=109.9s)]
*  in her view, about where and how those properties or accommodations can be paid for. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  So there are still big outstanding questions here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  The council says it's doing its best. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=124.5s)]
*  It's responsible for making sure residents are OK. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  A major incident has been declared. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=129.22s)]
*  As for the hole, well, it could be a while before it is filled in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=131.8s)]
*  And this is a very busy, bustling village with lots of businesses. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  This road is always very busy, I'm told. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=139.1s)]
*  And people just don't know when life is going to get back to normal. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=142.46s)]
*  Tom Simons reporting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5C90kiAMw&t=146.38s)]
