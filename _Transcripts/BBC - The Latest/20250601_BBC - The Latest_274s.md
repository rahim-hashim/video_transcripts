*  We begin with developments in the Middle East. At least 31 Palestinians have been killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=0.0s)]
*  and many more wounded in Israeli tank fire as they waited to get aid, according to Gaza's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=4.96s)]

*  the aftermath. A number of sources in RAFA say that earlier, as thousands of people gathered [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=16.4s)]
*  at an aid distribution centre, Israeli tanks fired. A British surgeon in Gaza said there [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=21.72s)]
*  was a mass casualty incident. But the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=27.04s)]
*  charge of distributing aid at the centre, says the reports are false and fabricated. The [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=32.08s)]
*  exact details remain unclear. Israel's government doesn't allow international journalists to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=38.04s)]
*  report from inside Gaza. The Israeli army says it's currently unaware of injuries caused [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=43.08s)]
*  by IDF fire within the aid distribution site. To get more on developments there, let's go [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=48.76s)]
*  live to Jerusalem and join our Middle East regional editor, Sebastian Usher. Sebastian, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=54.88s)]
*  a lot of conflicting reports we're hearing. What more do we know about what exactly happened? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=60.2s)]
*  The original reports that we had from quite early in the morning were pretty clear from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=67.4s)]
*  Palestinian sources in RAFA, in the area where they say this incident took place. The numbers [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=73.72s)]
*  of those who are said to have been killed or wounded has risen during the day. As you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=82.96s)]
*  say, the health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, is given as its latest figure. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=87.88s)]
*  For those killed in RAFA, near apparently an aid distribution centre is at least 31, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=94.12s)]
*  and more than 100 or 150 people wounded. There was also an incident at another aid distribution [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=102.36s)]
*  centre, according to Palestinian sources in Gaza, the Netzerim corridor, which is higher [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=110.16s)]
*  up in the centre of Gaza, and there were casualties reported from there. We've heard from doctors [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=117.16s)]
*  in one of the main hospitals, the Nasser Hospital, where casualties have been taken today, that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=124.8s)]
*  they had received around 200 people who had been wounded in incidents during the day, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=130.28s)]
*  and that many of those, a doctor has been telling us on the BBC, had wounds that were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=138.28s)]
*  from bullets. Now, as you were saying in your introduction here, the group which distributes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=146.28s)]
*  aid, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has essentially denied these reports flat out, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=155.28s)]
*  saying that they're false, that they're fabricated, that no one was injured or shot at near either [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=163.28s)]
*  of these two aid distribution points, and that these are lies, essentially, that have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=171.28s)]
*  been fermented by Hamas. Now, we haven't had a particularly long comment from the Israeli [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=177.28s)]
*  army as yet officially. They have simply said that the incident is under review, but they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=183.28s)]
*  were unaware of any incident where injuries have been caused by Israeli fire. We have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=191.28s)]
*  heard, one of my colleagues has been contacted by an IDF soldier in Rafah, essentially saying [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=198.48s)]
*  that from what he has seen, it's not true that there was no shooting of people at this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=205.8s)]
*  aid distribution centre there, and that the reports are not correct. So it is unclear [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=213.8s)]
*  what the situation is. What seems certain, what we know, is that there have again been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=222.8s)]
*  a large number of casualties who have been brought into hospitals in the area in Gaza, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=228.8s)]
*  near where these incidents are said to have happened. We've had a number of fatalities, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=235.8s)]
*  again, as we've seen each day, and the issue around this new mechanism of distributing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=239.8s)]
*  aid through this group, the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, has again been put into question by [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=245.8s)]
*  these incidents. As I say, the Foundation itself has said that the reports, not just [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=250.8s)]
*  today, but other reports that have been over the last two or three days since they became [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=255.8s)]
*  operational, have been false. Okay, Sebastiaan Asher, of course, we wait to hear more about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=259.8s)]
*  what is happening on the ground there, but for the moment, thank you very much for sharing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=266.8s)]
*  some much needed context on all of those developments. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH6ZCkdB-k&t=270.8s)]
