Video Description: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – controversial US and Israel-backed aid network – will not immediately resume distributing aid after a full-day closure on Wednesday. 
 
The Israeli military warned Palestinians on Wednesday not to approach GHF aid distribution sites while “reorganisation work” was under way, saying that access roads to those locations would be “considered combat zones”.
 
At least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire close to a distribution centre on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.
 
The IDF said that its troops fired shots after identifying suspects who moved towards them "deviating from the designated access routes".
 
GHF said operations will restart when maintenance and repair work on its distribution sites is complete.

*  In Gaza, the controversial new aid organisation working in the territory has postponed the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=0.0s)]
*  reopening of its facilities. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=5.0s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the US and Israel, closed its aid [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=7.36s)]
*  distribution centres on Wednesday after a series of incidents during which dozens of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=12.98s)]
*  Palestinians were shot dead trying to access them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=17.76s)]
*  The United Nations and other aid organisations continue to press Israel to allow them into [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=21.36s)]
*  Gaza to deliver aid, which they say have been sitting on the border ready to go in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=26.96s)]
*  At the same time, the US has vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for an unconditional [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=32.24s)]
*  and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=39.08s)]
*  A lot to discuss. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  We can talk to Hussein Haridi, Egyptian ambassador and former Assistant Foreign Minister for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Egypt. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=48.18s)]
*  Sir, welcome. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=49.18s)]
*  We've just been speaking to a representative for UNICEF who says that this Gaza Humanitarian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=50.18s)]
*  Foundation just does not meet humanitarian principles that provide proper and dignified [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  aid distribution. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=61.48s)]
*  What is your assessment of this new foundation? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=63.76s)]
*  Well, I get the suspension of this, of the activities of this organisation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  American, the American organisation proves, madam, that the United States, the American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=74.08s)]
*  administration is working with the Israeli government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=82.12s)]
*  And the talk or these reports, press reports that there are disagreements between the American [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=87.04s)]
*  administration and the Israeli government under Mr Netanyahu are not quite accurate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=94.92s)]
*  I guess, I guess we, after the American veto yesterday to a draft resolution before the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=100.92s)]
*  Security Council of the United Nations, I guess that's further proof that the position [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=110.28s)]
*  of the American administration is aligned with Mr Netanyahu's government. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=116.8s)]
*  So, the suspension of the, the suspension of the activities of this American aid organisation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  is understandable in the context of what I have just said. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=133.0s)]
*  The United States yesterday, by vetoing, exercising its veto power to this draft resolution, has [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=138.52s)]
*  proven that it's complicit in what Israel is doing in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=147.72s)]
*  And I, if you allow me, madam, the draft resolution called for the release of the hostages, the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=152.68s)]
*  hostages, but in the meantime called for the immediate cessation of hostilities and an [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  unconditional ceasefire and with the unconditional access of humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  And the act of vetoing this draft resolution means that the United States really is supporting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  all the objectives of the Israeli government in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=185.36s)]
*  And any talk, any talk about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza on the part of the American [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=189.24s)]
*  administration really does not hold water, madam. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=196.32s)]
*  It is quite the accusation, sir, to say that the US is complicit in what Israel is doing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=200.4s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=207.4s)]
*  If the United States were to say to you, look, we are just trying to facilitate a ceasefire [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=208.88s)]
*  agreement and yes, you say you point to their vetoing of that resolution, which also included [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  a clause calling for unrestricted aid to get in. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=220.72s)]
*  If they say that they just simply want to ceasefire, what do you, how do you respond [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=225.96s)]
*  to that? Because like I say, to suggest that the US is complicit in what Israel is doing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=230.52s)]
*  is a really strong accusation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, madam, the proof is the veto yesterday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=238.72s)]
*  If we review the main paragraphs in the draft resolution, I guess it meets all the standards, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=243.56s)]
*  all the demands of the international community. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=251.56s)]
*  And Mr. Marco Rubio, the United States Secretary of State, defending the veto said, yes, from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=254.28s)]
*  the American part of view, it was counterproductive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=262.72s)]
*  And I don't see how such a draft resolution with the main paragraphs, as I explained them, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=266.56s)]
*  could be counterproductive. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=273.2s)]
*  What now I am personally speaking, I guess the objectives, when the United States is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  speaking about a ceasefire, it wants the ceasefire to be applied according to conditions of Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=281.4s)]
*  And of course, this is not acceptable either to the Hamas organization or to some Arab [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=289.28s)]
*  countries. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  The Israeli conditions, the Israeli conditions are not about the release of hostages, madam. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=296.84s)]
*  It's about the post-war Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=302.76s)]
*  So when I say that the United States is complicit in what Israel is doing in the Gaza Strip, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=305.28s)]
*  that's what I mean, that there is an identity of use between Washington and Israel on how [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  and under what conditions this ceasefire could obtain. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=321.84s)]
*  I didn't mean to say that the United States does not want a ceasefire, but the United [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=328.12s)]
*  States, what I meant is that the United States wants a ceasefire according to Israeli conditions. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  And we have been, ever since last January, these negotiations and the mediation efforts [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  have failed because the mediators, Egypt, Qatar, are trying or have been trying to bridge [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=347.36s)]
*  the gap between what Israel is calling for and what Hamas could accept. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=353.84s)]
*  The U.S. ambassador to the UN was saying that they would not support any measure that fails [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=360.08s)]
*  to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza, arguably something [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=363.64s)]
*  that Israel is also calling for. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=369.2s)]
*  Sir, I just wonder, because Egypt and Qatar have been instrumental in trying to move forward [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  on some form of ceasefire, help us to understand where we are with those negotiations. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=375.32s)]
*  Well, apparently, madam, that these two countries are still exercising their efforts, but we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=380.56s)]
*  are waiting for the results. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=390.12s)]
*  The results would be a complete ceasefire, the release of the hostages, the numbers would [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=392.56s)]
*  be of course negotiated between the Israelis and the Hamas, and then the unfettered delivery, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=398.68s)]
*  unconditional delivery of humanitarian assistance. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=406.32s)]
*  I can't understand, madam, I can't understand. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=416.76s)]
*  On purely humanitarian grounds, how can any country, and in this case, a great power, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=419.24s)]
*  justifies its refusal, its rejection of a United Nations Security Council resolution [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=427.24s)]
*  calling for unconditional delivery of human assistance because this draft resolution has [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=435.24s)]
*  failed to condemn the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=442.24s)]
*  There is a very dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, and yesterday I was following [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=449.24s)]
*  on the BBC the interview by the chief of the International Red Cross in which he said, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=455.24s)]
*  and I'm quoting her, she said that the situation in Gaza is hell on earth. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=462.24s)]
*  What? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=470.24s)]
*  Can't we stop, can't we stop on purely, madam, humanitarian basis, can't we stop what's going [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=471.24s)]
*  on in Gaza now? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=479.24s)]
*  Two million people are starving to death. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=480.24s)]
*  A dire situation, but just in a sentence, because this is always the bugbear, what happens [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=483.24s)]
*  to Hamas? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=489.24s)]
*  Madam, there is an Egyptian initiative that was approved by the Arab world, by the Muslim [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=491.24s)]
*  countries, and by the leading European powers, and it has stated, although implicitly, that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=500.24s)]
*  in the post-war Gaza, Hamas won't have any role. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=508.24s)]
*  That is very clear. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=514.24s)]
*  Hussein Haridi, Egyptian ambassador, former assistant foreign minister for Egypt, thank [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=516.24s)]
*  you very much for your clarity. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=520.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me, madam. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYijbRRfws&t=522.24s)]
