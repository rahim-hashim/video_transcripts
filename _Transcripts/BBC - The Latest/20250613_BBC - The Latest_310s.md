Video Description: With 64 sold out shows across North and South America, Shakira has played to more than two million fans – the biggest stadium tour of the year.
The tour is titled Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (Women No Longer Cry) after Shakira's latest album, which was inspired by some of the most intense heartbreak and personal upheaval she'd ever experienced.
With exclusive access, the BBC’s Mark Savage goes back, under and on stage with Shakira as she brings her blockbuster stadium show to Miami the place she calls home.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E)
*  It's the biggest tour of 2025 and as fans gather in Miami's hard rock stadium behind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=0.0s)]
*  the scenes, thousands of crystals are being sewn onto catsuits and guitars are being tuned. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Ready for the moment Shakira enters the stadium with her wolf pack of fans and she's asked [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=17.96s)]
*  us to join her. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=22.92s)]
*  And here we go, we are walking right into the stadium with Shakira. This is going to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=23.92s)]
*  be amazing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=31.76s)]
*  Now I have to ask, you came off stage an hour ago, why are you here talking to us and not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  in bed with a tub of ice cream just flopping out? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=50.44s)]
*  I don't know, I warn you, I might not make a lot of sense right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=54.08s)]
*  Do you feel it physically? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=66.08s)]
*  Yes I do, I do, I do, absolutely. It was really hot today and humid. This is a very physical [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=68.08s)]
*  show and I'm dancing throughout the entire show. It is always challenging, you know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=73.52s)]
*  to put together a show of this size and to make it happen every night. It doesn't matter [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=79.0s)]
*  if you're sad or you had a bad day or if you're sick or if you're coughing. You just have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=83.52s)]
*  to do your best and miraculously make it happen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=91.16s)]
*  The tour comes after a turbulent couple of years for the star, after a split from the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=99.72s)]
*  father of her children, the Spanish footballer Gerard Pique, and a move back to the United [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=103.68s)]
*  States. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=108.48s)]
*  God knows that the past few years haven't been easy for me, but you know, life has its [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=109.48s)]
*  ways to reward us and this is definitely one of them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=114.92s)]
*  But what I've learned is that a fall isn't the end, but the beginning of an even better [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=118.0s)]
*  journey. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  The music that I created these past couple of years has really helped me transform all [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=123.48s)]
*  that pain and the emotions into something more productive or more precious. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=129.56s)]
*  There's a beautiful moment in the show where you're singing acrustica, which is dedicated [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=137.0s)]
*  to your two sons, and then they appear on the video screens and sing next to you. How [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=141.08s)]
*  do you keep yourself together during that moment? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=145.36s)]
*  Oh, I melt. My heart melts every time when I see them on that screen and I hear the little [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=147.24s)]
*  voices. They're just everything to me. They're my engine and the reason why I'm alive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=152.8s)]
*  In her home country of Colombia, Shakira has been a star since she was a teenager. But [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=166.8s)]
*  with her sights set on global domination, she quickly moved to the US and taught herself [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=173.68s)]
*  to speak English. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  I was only 19 years old and I moved to the US like many other Colombian immigrants who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=180.56s)]
*  come to this country hoping to find an opportunity. I was one of them. I remember I was surrounded [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=188.88s)]
*  by Spanish and English dictionaries because back in the day I didn't really have Google [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=195.2s)]
*  or Chad GPT to make songs. That's how I started writing my first songs and then I got into [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=200.6s)]
*  poetry and started trying to understand how the English language works. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=206.44s)]
*  Hola Miami! Como esta mi gente? Wow, it feels so special tonight to be singing at home. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=212.44s)]
*  This is home! [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=223.44s)]
*  What does it feel like being an immigrant in the US at the moment? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=224.96s)]
*  Well, for an immigrant in the US, it means living in constant fear and it's painful to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=229.0s)]
*  see. I just hope that they can be treated and that we all can be treated under principles [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=239.0s)]
*  of equity and freedom, those same principles that shaped this nation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=246.8s)]
*  Soy Aguiña Hector! [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  Can we do some quick fire questions just to finish with? What's the first thing you do [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  when you wake up in the morning? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=262.68s)]
*  I grab my phone, drink some water, but lately I'm starting to meditate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=263.92s)]
*  What's harder, raising two boys or running a crew of 150 people around the world? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=272.68s)]
*  Definitely raising two boys. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=281.24s)]
*  And last of all, when will we see this tour in Europe? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=283.6s)]
*  I guess you'll have to stay tuned and wait and see. We can't say dates yet, but we're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=286.6s)]
*  close to announcing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=293.88s)]
*  In a summer where some stadium shows have struggled to sell out, Shakira is on a high. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=297.44s)]
*  All she needs now is some time to recharge. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=302.68s)]
*  I need a banana. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=305.2s)]
*  Huh? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=307.2s)]
*  Banana! [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=308.2s)]
*  Banana? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5FJ3Qv25E&t=309.2s)]
