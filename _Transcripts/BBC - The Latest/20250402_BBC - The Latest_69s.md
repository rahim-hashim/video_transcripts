**BBC - The Latest:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA)
*  It's very windy out here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=0.0s)]
*  We didn't want to bring out the big charts [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=1.1400000000000001s)]
*  because it had no chance of standing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=2.64s)]
*  Fortunately, we came armed with a little smaller chart. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=4.64s)]
*  China, first row, 67 percent. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=7.62s)]
*  That's tariffs charged to the USA. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=10.24s)]
*  So we're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  I think, in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=18.28s)]
*  So how can anybody be upset? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=22.1s)]
*  They will be because we never charge anybody anything. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=24.46s)]
*  But now we're going to charge. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=27.1s)]
*  You know, you think of European Union, very friendly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  They rip us off. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  It's so sad to see. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=32.48s)]
*  It's so pathetic. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=34.28s)]
*  Thirty-nine percent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  We're going to charge them 20 percent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=37.42s)]
*  So we're charging them essentially half. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=40.98s)]
*  Oh, look at Cambodia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=43.56s)]
*  Ninety-seven percent. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=44.92s)]
*  We're going to bring it down to 49. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=47.06s)]
*  They made a fortune with the United States of America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=48.66s)]
*  United Kingdom, 10 percent. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=51.36s)]
*  And we'll go 10 percent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=53.7s)]
*  So we'll do the same thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=55.36s)]
*  At the same time, we will establish a minimum baseline tariff of 10 percent. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=57.36s)]
*  You notice that on the chart. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=61.9s)]
*  And that'll be on other countries to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4J9Ul8QvkA&t=63.8s)]
