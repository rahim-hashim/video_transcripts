*  charities are urging Israel to let them do their jobs, saying this is one of the worst [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=17.92s)]
*  humanitarian failures of our generation and every single person in Gaza is relying on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=22.84s)]
*  humanitarian aid to survive. Israel has vowed to maintain its blockage on humanitarian aid, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=28.68s)]
*  saying it is the only way to force Hamas to release the 58 hostages still being held there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=34.24s)]
*  Let's speak to Georgia Tasi, who is in the Gaza project director for Save the Children, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=40.56s)]
*  and welcome here to the programme. In terms of this development, those 12 major aid organisations, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=47.04s)]
*  your assessment of this move, first of all? Yes, well, as you say, Save the Children are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  joining all the other major heads of aid organisations here on the Gaza Strip to declare [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=61.56s)]
*  emphatically that the resumption of hostilities in Gaza is nothing short of a death sentence [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=66.36s)]
*  for children and their families. It is true, the aid system is definitely on the brink of collapse. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=72.12s)]
*  We have widespread indiscriminate bombing, deliberate targeting of aid workers, and now [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=77.56s)]
*  with 46 days that have passed without any commercial or humanitarian supplies [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=83.48s)]
*  entering Gaza, that means we are with a chronic and severe shortage of food, fuel and critical [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  medical supplies, and it's really driving up the already significant rates of child and maternal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=96.36s)]
*  malnutrition. I don't want to draw you very much into the politics of all of this, but Israel has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=101.64s)]
*  been quite open about not allowing this sort of aid into the Gaza Strip. Have you been surprised [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=108.12s)]
*  there's not been more international reaction to the decision that has been made and has been in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  place now for weeks? That's right, and I guess I worry that the international community is becoming [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  numb to the imagery that they see here in Gaza, that just another day passes, you see more footage [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=129.16s)]
*  of mothers crying over the dead bodies of their children, and I think there may be a bit of a case [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=135.24s)]
*  of people feeling just so overwhelmed and so helpless that they turn away, and they think this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=141.24s)]
*  is something that is happening far away and that they can't do anything about it, and so we are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  worried about this compassion fatigue, and so we certainly want to make sure that we are encouraging [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  people to speak out and have the courage to look away. What does facing total collapse mean? That [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=157.24s)]
*  is the quote being used by these 12 agencies, including yours. In human terms, what does that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=164.12s)]
*  actually mean? That means no food being available for the citizens of Gaza. That means hospitals, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=170.6s)]
*  the remaining hospitals that haven't been targeted, having to close down because they simply don't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  have the medical supplies, certainly they don't have the blood stocks. There's no fuel for any [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=183.72s)]
*  of us to move around, and so I think most of us who are here, we're risking our lives along with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=188.28s)]
*  our Palestinian colleagues, but it feels like we're trying to do this job with both hands tied [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=193.56s)]
*  behind our backs. And in terms of what you need to do, in terms of what you have available ready to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=197.88s)]
*  go in, really briefly, what could go in if you were allowed to actually take it in? Well, like many [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=206.76s)]
*  aid organizations, we have over 50 trucks waiting at the border, all filled with food, shelter kits, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=214.28s)]
*  clothing, medical supplies. So the aid organizations are ready to go. We have all the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=220.2s)]
*  supplies ready to enter Gaza. They're just not being permitted to enter. Some of us have some [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  stocks remaining in our warehouses, but unfortunately we don't have guaranteed safe movement, so we can't [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=232.28s)]
*  even access our own warehouses and distribute them on the Gaza Strip because we don't have any guarantee [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=238.12s)]
*  that we might be attacked. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apK1W9KR9c8&t=243.88s)]
