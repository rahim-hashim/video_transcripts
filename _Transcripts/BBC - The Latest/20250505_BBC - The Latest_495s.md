Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.
 
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying "a very fast death".
 
So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business?

# What will Trump's film tariffs mean for Hollywood and movies? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE)
*  Films are the latest target for President Trump and his tariffs as he's announced a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=0.0s)]
*  100% import tax on all movies made outside the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=5.76s)]
*  Mr Trump said Hollywood was being devastated as more American filmmakers and studios work [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=11.4s)]
*  overseas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=17.0s)]
*  He accused other countries of luring film crews with tax breaks, calling it a threat [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  to national security. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=23.04s)]
*  The move comes as the White House is under mounting criticism over its trade policies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=24.88s)]
*  which have seen the president impose sweeping tariffs on countries across the globe. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=29.68s)]
*  But for the president, this is all about bringing jobs back to the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=34.88s)]
*  Writing on his Truth Social platform, he said, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm authorizing the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative to immediately [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=42.08s)]
*  begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  that are produced in foreign lands. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=53.28s)]
*  The president gave more details about the reason behind that decision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=56.6s)]
*  President Trump speaking a few hours ago, will global cinema pay the price? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=116.6s)]
*  We've had some reaction from key international markets for US films such as India, which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  have been deeply concerned. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=150.92s)]
*  Bollywood filmmaker Shekhar Kapoor said that over 75% of box office of Hollywood films [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=153.04s)]
*  come from outside the US, including India of course, and significant parts of the budget [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=158.32s)]
*  of those films are spent outside the US. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=163.44s)]
*  He said he thinks Trump's imposition of that 100% tariff on all films imported into the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=165.6s)]
*  may encourage Hollywood to move outside the US. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=171.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, another well-known Indian filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri says that President Trump's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=174.4s)]
*  tariff on films was a disastrous move. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  He said if this absurdity prevails, India's struggling film industry would collapse entirely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=182.64s)]
*  with no one to save it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=188.32s)]
*  Indian film leaders must wake up, unite and fight this threat instead of chasing paparazzi [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=190.28s)]
*  and self-glorification. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, our North America Business correspondent Erin Delmore joins me now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=198.8s)]
*  We'll get more reaction about how this might impact the UK film industry in a moment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=204.56s)]
*  But first of all, Erin, let's set the stall out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=208.8s)]
*  How bad is the state of the US film industry that President Trump thinks needs this change [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=211.68s)]
*  of policy? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=218.4s)]
*  Well, if we go by the numbers, film production in the US is down 40% from where it was a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=219.4s)]
*  decade ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=225.72s)]
*  And another survey that I encountered this morning was showing that jobs in the film [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=226.8s)]
*  industry, including TV and movies, were down 25% since the year 2022. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=230.28s)]
*  Now let's talk about some of the touchstones here that have really impacted the state of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=235.32s)]
*  TV and film in the US. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=239.16s)]
*  Certainly the COVID pandemic kept people from going to the box office and halted production [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=240.68s)]
*  on some of these big films and indeed on smaller projects as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=244.88s)]
*  And we also saw the actor strike in Hollywood as well, which also put a halt on some production [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=248.0s)]
*  too. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=252.96s)]
*  President Trump is targeting an industry that is set to haul $248 billion in spending in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  the year 2025. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  And sure enough, we have seen production go overseas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=262.02s)]
*  A lot of places have been able to lure production based on tax credits or reimbursements or [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=264.32s)]
*  cheaper labor. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=269.66s)]
*  But, Regine, if we thought that it was complicated to unpack how tariffs would work on the North [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=270.66s)]
*  American car industry, which sees parts coming in from around the world for cars assembled [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=274.88s)]
*  in the USA, well, just imagine a film production where there could be scenes shot overseas, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=279.52s)]
*  actors hired from other countries, all kinds of moving parts that don't observe country [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=284.92s)]
*  lines and country borders. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=288.52s)]
*  That's how complicated a picture we're talking about. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=290.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=292.12s)]
*  Erin Dalmore in New York, thank you very much for that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=293.12s)]
*  Well, we talked a bit about concern from filmmakers in India's film industry, Bollywood. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=295.76s)]
*  Let's turn to reaction here in the UK as British filmmakers are warning that freelancers in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=300.6s)]
*  the industry are at risk of being jobless if U.S. productions are pulled. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=306.44s)]
*  Well, Philippa Charles is head of Bechtu. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=311.4s)]
*  That is, of course, the union for broadcasting, entertainment, communication and theater. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=314.2s)]
*  And she joins me now from Guildford. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=318.6s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=321.0s)]
*  What do you think the impact of these tariffs will be on Britain's film industry? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=323.44s)]
*  Well, good evening. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=328.44s)]
*  Yes, it could be quite devastating. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=330.44s)]
*  I think we're all trying to currently get our heads around what Donald Trump is planning [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=333.16s)]
*  and how it might work, because as your correspondent said, it's incredibly difficult to put tariffs [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  on an industry which is a truly global industry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=344.92s)]
*  If it does go ahead, what sort of retaliation do you think the UK should impose then, if [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=350.0s)]
*  at all? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=355.72s)]
*  Well, I imagine that I've spoken to government ministers today and like me, they are busy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=356.72s)]
*  trying to get their heads around what it might mean in practice. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=362.76s)]
*  And I'm sure they'll use all their best diplomatic skills through discussions around trade to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  make sure that that doesn't happen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=374.24s)]
*  I mean, clearly, we don't want it to happen because the British film and TV industry is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=375.8s)]
*  hugely beneficial. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  The creative industries forms part of our industrial strategy focus at the moment. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  And the impact on freelancers would just be huge. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  They've already had a really torrid time since the pandemic and then as a result of the strikes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=396.24s)]
*  in the US, which halted many productions in the UK. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=403.0s)]
*  So the industry is really only starting to recover from those difficult times and looking [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  ahead to a brighter future. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=413.72s)]
*  And this announcement is clearly going to be very concerning for the whole industry. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  Of course, we don't know many of the details, but how do you think those costs might get [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  passed on then and therefore impact people like you mentioned, the freelancers, also [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=425.04s)]
*  actors, makeup artists, production crew? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole gamut of people who work on the film, aren't there? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=432.68s)]
*  There is indeed. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=437.72s)]
*  I mean, it's really difficult to see how this tariff might work. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=438.72s)]
*  He's talked about film, but is he also talking about high end TV drama? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=442.44s)]
*  Where would the tariffs be focused on? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=447.64s)]
*  I think it's a really difficult, as your correspondent said, it's a really difficult [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=451.84s)]
*  thing to understand quite how it would work. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=456.12s)]
*  And I think there's been some rowing back already this evening. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=460.0s)]
*  I think Trump has said that he's going to talk to the industry. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=462.88s)]
*  And I noticed that Netflix shares have dropped as a result of this announcement that he made [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  overnight. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  I really do hope that he sees sense and the industry can persuade him that actually, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=474.56s)]
*  because of the global nature of film and TV, that film can be shot here and then elsewhere [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  overseas on location, but post-production might be done in the US. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=488.8s)]
*  So it really is a complex picture. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzw7ZrSHYqE&t=492.84000000000003s)]
