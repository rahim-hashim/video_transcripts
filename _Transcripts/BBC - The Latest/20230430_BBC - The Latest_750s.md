*  From the moment we arrive on this planet, we're all heading in the same direction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=0.0s)]
*  But maybe the way that the years play out isn't inevitable. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=10.72s)]
*  So how about the idea of being able to increase our health spans, live the better years of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=14.72s)]
*  our lives for longer, feel like we're 40 at 60? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=20.32s)]
*  I let a system of science and data run my body. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=24.28s)]
*  There's 15 to 17 years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=28.88s)]
*  We head to California to meet the scientists and founders who want to make it a reality. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you consider yourself a guinea pig? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=54.72s)]
*  I consider myself to be an explorer on the frontiers trying to find out what's possible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=56.2s)]
*  Tech entrepreneur Brian Johnson is spending millions trying to turn back time on his body. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  Refer to myself as a professional rejuvenation athlete. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=71.36s)]
*  It's a new sport I want to create. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=75.12s)]
*  I'm not a biohacker, I'm not a health enthusiast, I am a professional rejuvenation athlete. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=77.72s)]
*  I love it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  Working with a team of 30 scientists, his daily life is dictated by an extreme regime [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=85.8s)]
*  of fitness, diet, tablets, tracking and treatments. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=92.72s)]
*  I am chronologically 45 years old, biologically I'm a few hundred ages. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=99.24s)]
*  My left ear is 64, my fitness test to say I'm 18, my heart is 37, my diaphragm strength [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=104.92s)]
*  is 18 and I playfully say I'm trying to become like an 18 year old, my son is 17 and so I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=111.12s)]
*  always tease him and say when I grow younger I want to be like you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=116.68s)]
*  Where's he taking me? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=120.68s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=124.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=125.68s)]
*  Where to start in here? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=126.68s)]
*  Is this one of those devices that measures the age of your skin? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=132.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=135.08s)]
*  How's yours doing? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=136.08s)]
*  We've made about 22 years of progress in reversing the age of my skin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=137.28s)]
*  It takes all these images of your face and you get about 10 reports on pore size, UV [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  spots, reds, browns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=145.84s)]
*  Your skin is amazing but is this just from your regime or is there other help? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Other help too. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=151.44s)]
*  We have some lasers over there which I'll show you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=152.44s)]
*  There's no injections, that's just from everything in here? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=153.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=155.84s)]
*  And what do we have next? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=156.84s)]
*  So this is something that also tells you the health of your cardiovascular system through [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=157.84s)]
*  your age. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  It looks at advanced glyconated products in your skin. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  So if you want to try it, you could put your arm on it and it will tell you your age. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=165.6s)]
*  Ideal score would be around two. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=172.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=175.2s)]
*  So I'm only a little bit too old for my age. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=176.2s)]
*  It could be worse. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=178.64s)]
*  What's next? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=179.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=180.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=181.64s)]
*  This is an ultrasound machine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=182.64s)]
*  It's medical grade. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=183.64s)]
*  So this is what you'd see in a hospital. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=184.64s)]
*  Are you having a baby? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=185.64s)]
*  Who knows with what you're getting up to already? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=186.64s)]
*  What are you actually using it for? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=187.64s)]
*  So we look at the brain, the lungs, the heart, the pancreas, the prostate, tendons, ligaments, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=189.44s)]
*  everything. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=195.4s)]
*  It's really a useful technology to have in the clinic to do on a routine basis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=196.4s)]
*  How do you feel just before you do any of this tracking? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=200.84s)]
*  Do you get a bit nervous, hopeful? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=203.32s)]
*  Do you have expectations? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=204.92s)]
*  It is a game. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=207.04s)]
*  Some of my most happiest days are when we do these full measurement days. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=208.04s)]
*  What's your motivation? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=216.04s)]
*  Are you doing this for yourself or for humanity? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=217.04s)]
*  When I was 21 years old, I decided that I wanted to spend my life doing something meaningful [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=220.52s)]
*  for the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  I didn't know what to do, so I said I'm going to make a whole bunch of money being an entrepreneur [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  by the age of 30, then I'll decide what to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=229.8s)]
*  So for the past, since I sold my company, Braintree Venmo, I made $300 million. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=232.08s)]
*  This question was, what could I do that would matter in the year 2500? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=237.12s)]
*  Right now, it could be aging. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=242.68s)]
*  If we slowed the speed of aging and even reversed it, it would change what it means to be human. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=244.44s)]
*  Do you think you're risking your health here? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  And all the things you're doing to protect it, do you think there's also some real risk? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=253.08s)]
*  Certainly, there's always risks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=256.08s)]
*  But there's potentially an argument that we are being more safe than anyone else because [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=259.6s)]
*  we have the rigor of measurement. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=264.48s)]
*  Whilst Brian signed his life away to experimentation, I visit the BUC, the world's first institute [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=267.52s)]
*  for aging research. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=276.64s)]
*  These scientists are working on drugs that they hope could delay age-related disease. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=282.08s)]
*  Would you say there's been huge scientific advancement in this field recently, or is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=291.08s)]
*  there just a sudden trend for investment and interest in it? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=295.48s)]
*  The science has matured in terms of, you know, we've been doing this for close to 30 years, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=299.16s)]
*  understanding basic mechanism of aging, number one. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=304.04s)]
*  Number two, societal needs are there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  We have a rapidly aging population with an increasing burden of chronic disease. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=309.8s)]
*  One really important discovery in mice here was the ability to reduce what are called [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=316.8s)]
*  senescent cells. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=322.48s)]
*  These zombie cells play a useful role throughout our lifetimes, but as we age, we acquire many [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=326.8s)]
*  And as they also lead to inflammation, that increased number ends up providing a hotbed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=335.08s)]
*  for cancer and all sorts of disease. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=341.08s)]
*  But maybe we're missing something. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=347.08s)]
*  Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity, only about 7% on your genetics, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=350.08s)]
*  so you can't blame your parents. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=357.08s)]
*  A lot of exercise, some fasting, a lot of good sleep, a lot of social connection, very [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=359.08s)]
*  little alcohol. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=366.08s)]
*  Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24-hour day without ingesting any calories. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=368.08s)]
*  But if they work, why do we need to be trying to deal with this bigger picture of cellular senescence? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=374.08s)]
*  Senescence is still going to happen. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=380.08s)]
*  Hopefully, if you exercise, it's going to be delayed by 10, 15, 20 years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=383.08s)]
*  I don't mean to be saying that lifestyle interventions is all that needs to be done. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=387.08s)]
*  There's a need for science for the future. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=393.08s)]
*  What's that thing that people do where they sit on the floor and then they try and get up without using their hands? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=397.08s)]
*  Whatever Eric's been doing seems to be working. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=402.08s)]
*  This is meant to be some sort of sign of youth, isn't it, if you could stand up by not using your hands and just... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=405.08s)]
*  How can anyone do that, pushing your feet down? How is it possible? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=410.08s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=415.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=417.08s)]
*  I think it means that you're under 20 or something. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=418.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=420.08s)]
*  I can't do it. I can't do it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=421.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=423.08s)]
*  How furry friends could get their paws on a life-extending pill first, though. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=425.08s)]
*  I love my doctor bits. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=429.08s)]
*  You'll notice there are no Great Danes here. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=431.08s)]
*  There are no large dogs here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=433.08s)]
*  And it's because they can sometimes have a lifespan of six, seven, eight, nine years. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=435.08s)]
*  And they're not afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=439.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=441.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=443.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=445.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=447.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=449.08s)]
*  They're afraid of the big dogs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=451.08s)]
*  We're talking about the lifespan of six, seven, eight, nine years. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=453.08s)]
*  You know, almost half that of what a little guy like this could be expected to have. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=455.08s)]
*  And our hypothesis is that the short lifespan of big dogs is a disease. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=459.08s)]
*  So where are you at now with the trials? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=465.08s)]
*  So we're kicking off our big, pivotal study. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=468.08s)]
*  We're trying to understand, you know, does our drug extend lifespan and quality of life. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=470.08s)]
*  It's a preventative drug, inhibiting the protein that we believe drives big dogs to age fast. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=474.08s)]
*  And if everything goes to plan, we'll hopefully have a drug on market in 2025. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=480.08s)]
*  If successful, Loyal's drug could hasten a solution for humans too. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  The dogs eat similar diets to us. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=490.96s)]
*  They live in the same environment and they also develop the same age-related diseases [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=493.08s)]
*  we do at approximately the same time in our lifespan. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=496.52s)]
*  So if a drug works in a dog, it's not one-to-one to work in a human, but it's much more likely [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=498.96s)]
*  versus we do a lot of research in mice and that doesn't translate at all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=504.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm off to a longevity meet-up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=508.32s)]
*  So are these brainy scientists living the longevity lifestyle? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=516.6s)]
*  Well, there are still unopened bottles of wine, so probably. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=521.56s)]
*  Here tonight we had a longevity-friendly mix of food with the seaweed and the fish. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=525.0s)]
*  Other parts of the industry haven't been quite so wholesome, though. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=532.88s)]
*  For decades, there's been a lot of snake oil, a lot of miracle pills, the God Pill, all of this stuff. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=536.4s)]
*  And many have been desperate to believe. Just ask this leading Silicon Valley doctor. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=545.04s)]
*  I don't know why people want to gamble with their health. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=551.48s)]
*  I understand gambling with your money. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=555.16s)]
*  So if it's safe and it's not effective, like a vitamin, some vitamins are fine. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=556.92s)]
*  But if it's not proven safe and it's not proven effective, you're gambling with your health. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  And then there's people spending a lot of time doing these things and they're not living their life. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=566.08s)]
*  They're living the version of their life to give themselves a future life. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=570.48s)]
*  But what happens if that future life never materializes? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=574.88s)]
*  Good news is with all this new blood tests, there's new breath tests, there's urine tests, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=580.48s)]
*  there's wearables, there's apps, there's so many things to track things. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=586.48s)]
*  So if you really want to, like if you're overweight and you have high blood pressure [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=591.48s)]
*  and you love your wine and you love your life, but you want a pill to make you live long, guess what? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=596.48s)]
*  You can't stop the wind with your hands. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=601.48s)]
*  Whether pills or procedures are proven or not, there are a whole lot of people who are really obsessed. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=604.48s)]
*  Does it sometimes just seem a bit cold to you? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=611.48s)]
*  Very coldy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  And I try to protect my people against that coldy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  We try not to let it become that way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  There's one issue that none of this can resolve though. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  In the United States, the single biggest determinant of your life expectancy is your postcode, where you live. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  In the United States, the single biggest determinant of your life expectancy is your postcode, where you live. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=636.88s)]
*  And so that is a problem that cannot be engineered. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=643.88s)]
*  And there are bigger questions over how we may need to work longer, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=649.88s)]
*  the unexpected diseases that will emerge at these older ages, and our planet is already pretty busy. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=653.88s)]
*  First thing to consider is these changes that we're talking about are not going to happen tomorrow. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=661.08s)]
*  They're going to be happening slowly, the same way we've doubled our lifespan over the last 150 years, and we've slowly adapted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=668.08s)]
*  The reality is that we know a lot about the science of aging. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=676.08s)]
*  Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=680.08s)]
*  But the big scientific breakthroughs just aren't there yet. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=682.08s)]
*  So I guess I come away from this feeling more than ever that it's so important to live your healthiest life, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=687.08s)]
*  just maybe not quite to the extent of Brian Johnson. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=693.08s)]
*  Lucky us, we exist. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=699.08s)]
*  Let's play the most fun games we can, for as long as we can. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=702.08s)]
*  you [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77XPfUxaNs&t=746.08s)]
