**BBC - The Latest:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0)
*  The captain of the container ship that collided with a tanker in the North Sea has been arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=0.0s)]
*  on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. It's been confirmed the man is a Russian national. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=4.92s)]
*  These are the latest pictures coming to us from the North Sea and here you can see the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=10.28s)]
*  damage to that Portuguese container ship, the Solong, which is still on fire, flames [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  and smoke coming from the decks. And this is the American oil tanker which was carrying [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=18.68s)]
*  jet fuel for the US military when the collision happened off the coast of eastern England. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=24.34s)]
*  The company that manages the tanker said an initial review showed environmental impacts [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=28.82s)]
*  of the leaking jet fuel had been limited. Let's hear from our North of England correspondent, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=32.88s)]
*  Rowan Bridge, who's in Grimsby. What are today's developments, Rowan? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  Yes, well as you say, a 59-year-old man who we now know to be the captain of the Solong [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  and a Russian national was arrested yesterday. We had some news this morning that he remains [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  in police custody at the moment. He was arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=56.86s)]
*  and that followed the calling off of the search for a missing crew member from the Solong [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=62.34s)]
*  who is assumed to have died at sea. The police say they are still working to establish the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=66.9s)]
*  full circumstances of what happened in this crash. They are leading the criminal investigation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=73.22s)]
*  into what happened. Now yesterday, Mike Kane, the transport minister, stood up in Parliament [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=78.26s)]
*  in the UK and said that something must have gone terribly wrong for this crash to happen [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  but said that there was no evidence at the moment of any sort of foul play. The other [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=88.82s)]
*  major concern at the moment, as you say, is the two ships involved. As you said, we've [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  seen some pictures this morning which show the Solong still on fire so I think a priority [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=98.14s)]
*  will be trying to put out those flames. And you may have also seen footage where you can [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  see the hole in the side of the Stenner Immaculate where jet fuel has leaked from the vessel [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=108.28s)]
*  into the sea and the concern is that that is a potential threat to wildlife and marine [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=115.28s)]
*  life. Now, that was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel. The concern was how much of that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=120.28s)]
*  may end up in the sea. The initial assessment is that the damage may be less than was first [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=127.36s)]
*  feared because some of it, it looks like, may have burnt off in the explosions and fire [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=132.16s)]
*  that followed the collision and then some of it has evaporated from the surface of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=136.68s)]
*  sea. I think what they'll be doing now is trying to bring those fires under control [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=142.24s)]
*  and then we'll be looking at a salvage operation really, trying to rescue those ships and salvage [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=148.44s)]
*  the situation as it is. Yeah, some experts have said it's essential that these vessels [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=153.8s)]
*  are kept afloat or there's a whole range of other problems that they'll incur but it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=159.32s)]
*  easier said than done. Yeah, I mean there were concerns that the Salong was going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=164.56s)]
*  sink. In fact, Mike Kane, the Transport Minister, indicated that might be the case yesterday [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=170.88s)]
*  in Parliament. It now appears that that is less likely, that they are less worried about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=176.36s)]
*  it sinking. The Salong has indeed moved. Some messages from my colleagues this morning said [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  that it's clearly moved from where it was yesterday. So it's still adrift, if you like, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  but at the moment it doesn't seem to be at risk of sinking, which is one of the other [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=193.0s)]
*  fears that they had and what the consequences of that might be as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=196.36s)]
*  Roman, for the moment, thank you very much. Roman Bridge in Grimsby. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6JQ_T4XTv0&t=200.44s)]
