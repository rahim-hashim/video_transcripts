Video Description: A world-record breaking swimmer has told the BBC she was left “broken” by the training regime of one of the UK’s most successful swimming coaches. 

Rūta Meilutytė  – who, at just 15, won gold at the London 2012 Olympics – said coach Jon Rudd’s focus on her weight and diet contributed to her struggle with an eating disorder. 

Rudd has faced multiple allegations of bullying and verbal abuse of teenage swimmers. He has not responded to the BBC. 

The story raises wider questions about an alleged toxic culture for young swimmers in the UK.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg)
*  Ruth Emeliutite was coached here in the UK. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=0.0s)]
*  Age 15, she was about to make Olympic history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=4.2s)]
*  History has been made here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=8.16s)]
*  Youngest ever to win the event. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=9.68s)]
*  Lithuania get their first medal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=11.4s)]
*  It's a goal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=13.4s)]
*  How special is this for you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=14.36s)]
*  It's too much for me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=17.0s)]
*  In 2010, she joined Plymouth Leander, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  one of the most successful swimming clubs in the UK. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=21.88s)]
*  She was trained by head coach John Rudd, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=25.76s)]
*  credited with turning the club into a medal winning powerhouse. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  She has an inner drive and an intrinsic desire for success. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=32.36s)]
*  But behind John Rudd success was a darker side. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=36.32s)]
*  We've spoken to eight swimmers trained by Rudd, including Ruta. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=40.16s)]
*  They all describe pressure over their diet and weight, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=44.16s)]
*  with some making themselves sick to get thinner. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=47.08s)]
*  John said my ass is fat in one competition when I was 16. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=50.64s)]
*  I broke a world record that day. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=55.84s)]
*  I think that was because I was angry. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=57.8s)]
*  We've seen a review of a confidential, independent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=59.8s)]
*  investigation by Swim England in 2012. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  17 witnesses gave evidence about John Rudd's behaviour. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=66.52s)]
*  The investigation found that under Rudd's leadership, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=70.84s)]
*  swimmers were, as Swim England described it, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=73.52s)]
*  publicly flat shamed, verbally abused, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=76.16s)]
*  made to train while injured, inappropriately disciplined, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=78.84s)]
*  and that there was a bullying culture. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=82.12s)]
*  It recommended he be suspended for four months. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=84.4s)]
*  He never was. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  We've made numerous attempts to contact John Rudd [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=88.92s)]
*  about our investigation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=91.52s)]
*  He hasn't responded. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  Rebecca Adlington won gold in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, age 19. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=95.08s)]
*  My goodness, it is! [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  The reason why I think I was so successful is because my coach [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=104.08s)]
*  ultimately always saw me as a human being first. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  Other coaches would try and see how much they could burn their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=111.28s)]
*  athlete out or push them or shout at them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=114.44s)]
*  My coach did none of that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  In swimming, I have to acknowledge you are very exposed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=118.56s)]
*  I love the sport so much, but one big downside is body image. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=122.48s)]
*  And even now, 36 and people think I'm super confident [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=127.08s)]
*  at putting a costume on. I am not. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=131.12s)]
*  Plymouth Leander is under new leadership and says it can't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=133.56s)]
*  comment on historical incidents or decisions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=136.44s)]
*  It says it carried out a thorough review of its safeguarding [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=139.84s)]
*  policies and procedures to provide the safest possible [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=142.64s)]
*  environment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=146.52s)]
*  The club says John Rudd was employed directly by Plymouth [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=147.52s)]
*  College, which they were partnered with at the time, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=149.8s)]
*  and it was responsible for his oversight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Plymouth College says the club was responsible for safeguarding. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=155.28s)]
*  It says excellence should never come at the cost of individual [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=159.32s)]
*  wellbeing and that it's deeply concerned to hear these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=162.32s)]
*  swimmers' testimonies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  The failures of the investigation into Rudd have led [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=166.32s)]
*  Swim England to review 1,500 safeguarding cases across [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=168.84s)]
*  England, stretching back 20 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=173.44s)]
*  Swim England now says it's determined to learn from past mistakes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=176.16s)]
*  What would you say to all those children who have suffered [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=181.12s)]
*  as a result of failings within Swim England? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=184.56s)]
*  I would say I'm sorry. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=187.28s)]
*  We absolutely wish that you hadn't endured the poor [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=189.56s)]
*  experience that you did endure. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=193.24s)]
*  So deeply, deeply sorry for that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=195.76s)]
*  Rebecca Woods, BBC News. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqMlTFE0dg&t=198.32s)]
