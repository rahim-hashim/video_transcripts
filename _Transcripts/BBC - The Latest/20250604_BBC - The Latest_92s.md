**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs)
*  You can see where that blue tent is and the white van has been where they have been based over the past day or so. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=0.0s)]
*  And this whole area of scrubland, quite desolate really, is where the attention is being focused at the moment. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=9.0s)]
*  If I just look this way you can see one of the many derelict farm buildings that are on this site and they're dotted all over the place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=17.0s)]
*  This whole area is about 21 square kilometres so there's a lot to be searched through and it was associated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=25.0s)]
*  It's a place where Christian Bruckner, who's the chief suspect identified by German police, lived back in 2007 when Madeleine McCann disappeared. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=32.0s)]
*  Now just to give you a bigger sense of the geography of this area, down that way beyond the building is the city of Lagos. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=42.0s)]
*  About 10 minutes that way is Praetorleuth. Now that's where the McCann's apartment was from which she disappeared in May 2007. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=50.0s)]
*  And the place we're in is at Allaya but really the village is that way, we're on the outskirts of it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=57.0s)]
*  Beyond the blue tent and the police van is the sea and just another couple of hundred metres down that way there are some very steep cliffs and a fisherman's path. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=63.0s)]
*  So this is quite difficult terrain to get through. You can see it's really quite overgrown at the moment. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=74.0s)]
*  It's been quite a wet spring here in Portugal and that's not making things easy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=79.0s)]
*  A lot of people have come here and thrown their rubbish and a fly-tipping going on so there's all manner of things that will have happened in the intervening 18 years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=83.0s)]
*  But the clock's ticking. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXuaQvn2Zs&t=91.0s)]
