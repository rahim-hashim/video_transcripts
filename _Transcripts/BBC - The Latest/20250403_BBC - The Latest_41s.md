**BBC - The Latest:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw)
*  If you take on one of us, you take on all of us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=4.0s)]
*  including the European Union, is a major blow to the world economy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=9.0s)]
*  I agree with President Trump that others are taking unfair advantage of the current rules, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=14.0s)]
*  and I'm ready to support any efforts to make the global trading system [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=21.0s)]
*  fit for the realities of the global economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=27.0s)]
*  But I also want to be clear, reaching for tariffs as your first and last tool will not fix it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kNwKYr2rw&t=32.0s)]
