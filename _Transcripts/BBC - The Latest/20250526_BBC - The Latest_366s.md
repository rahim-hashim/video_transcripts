*  President Trump says he's furious at Russia's continued bombardment of Ukrainian cities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=0.0s)]
*  and is considering imposing further sanctions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=4.72s)]
*  Responding to questions from the media on Sunday night, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=7.44s)]
*  Mr Trump said successive nights of deadly airstrikes had come in the middle of talks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=10.0s)]
*  and he was not happy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=14.4s)]
*  He was also critical of President Zelensky. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=15.88s)]
*  Russia mounted its biggest, heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far on Sunday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=18.52s)]
*  with at least a dozen people killed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Aruna Yengor has the latest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=25.04s)]
*  President Trump arriving in New Jersey last night seemed to have lost patience with the Russian president. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=26.8s)]
*  I'll give you an update. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=34.4s)]
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=35.84s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=38.08s)]
*  I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=41.4s)]
*  but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  And I don't like it at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=48.28s)]
*  OK, we're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=50.16s)]
*  I don't like it at all. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=55.56s)]
*  Despite US-led efforts to secure a ceasefire, Russia has ramped up its attacks on Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles were launched on Kiev and 30 other Ukrainian cities [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=64.84s)]
*  over the weekend in the largest attack since the war began three years ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=70.16s)]
*  According to Ukrainian officials, 12 people died, including three children from one family [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=75.2s)]
*  killed in the northwest of Zhatomir region. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Stanislav aged eight, Tamara 12 and Roman 17. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=83.8s)]
*  It's led Ukraine's president Zelensky to call for stronger condemnation from Washington. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  He said on social media, Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=94.96s)]
*  He continued, this cannot be ignored. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=101.08s)]
*  Silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourages Putin. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=103.64s)]
*  Speaking yesterday, the US president reiterated that sanctions were still a possibility. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=109.36s)]
*  You've talked before about putting more sanctions on Russia. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  Is that something you're considering more? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=119.96s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's wrong with him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=123.0s)]
*  There's pressure on the president to act. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=124.72s)]
*  The US Senate is planning to approve a massive sanctions package on Moscow, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=126.72s)]
*  which could impose 500 percent tariffs on Russia's allies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  It has support from Republicans and Democrats. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=135.32s)]
*  But last night, the US president also had strong words for President Zelensky, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=138.72s)]
*  saying that he was doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=143.24s)]
*  He added, everything out of his mouth causes problems. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=147.56s)]
*  I don't like it and it better stop. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=150.6s)]
*  The worsening situation on the ground comes even as Kiev and Moscow [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=154.56s)]
*  completed their biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Ukrainian prisoners arrived home yesterday. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=162.52s)]
*  Similar scenes in Russia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=166.28s)]
*  A thousand soldiers on each side have been swapped over the past three days. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=168.08s)]
*  But those scenes of joy are yet to be witnessed across Ukraine's cities, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=173.16s)]
*  where the bombardment continues. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=177.44s)]
*  Irina Iyengar, BBC News. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=179.88s)]
*  Our correspondent, James Waterhouse, is in Kiev. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=183.76s)]
*  He told us more about the reaction to the latest comments from Donald Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=185.72s)]
*  I think President Zelensky wanted a response, frankly, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=189.76s)]
*  after aerial bombardments we hadn't really seen before in terms of their scale. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=193.24s)]
*  And what's interesting is how they are intensifying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=198.6s)]
*  And they have intensified since Donald Trump returned to office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=201.64s)]
*  And yet the US president described his surprise as to how or why Vladimir Putin [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=205.08s)]
*  was launching rockets, in his words, at Ukrainian cities. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=212.44s)]
*  What Ukraine wants is for America to follow through on its threat [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=216.76s)]
*  of further sanctions for Russia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  And crucially, we heard Mr Trump do so for a second time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=223.44s)]
*  But he's done it in the past. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=227.76s)]
*  And that has not been followed up with action. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=229.72s)]
*  It's usually followed up with continued efforts at ceasefire talks [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=232.48s)]
*  and warm language between Washington and Moscow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=235.84s)]
*  But, you know, President Zelensky didn't hold back over the weekend. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=239.44s)]
*  He said American silence only encourages Russia. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=242.2s)]
*  He said, you know, the world can have a day off, whereas we're stuck here [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  still fighting this war and still having hundreds of drones and missiles [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=249.88s)]
*  land on our cities. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=253.28s)]
*  It's been a very difficult weekend for Kiev and dozens of other towns [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=255.0s)]
*  and cities across Ukraine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=259.32s)]
*  The air defences were once again going last night with air raid sirens [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=261.04s)]
*  as Russia continues to try and terrorise populations with these deliberate [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=265.44s)]
*  strategies, but also slowly, yes, but they also are advancing in the east [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  in a war that is not going Ukraine's way. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=277.48s)]
*  And there had been a pledge, hadn't there, recently for tougher sanctions [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=279.8s)]
*  from European leaders against Russia. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=282.88s)]
*  Where has that got to? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=285.12s)]
*  With European leaders, notably Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  is saying that there are further packages down the line. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=292.68s)]
*  They could be aimed at those in Vladimir Putin's inner circle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=296.92s)]
*  I mean, the European Union really has slapped a fair amount of penalties [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=300.68s)]
*  on Russia. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  It was once one of its biggest trading partners before the full scale [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=306.12s)]
*  invasion, so it's difficult to see what further effect could be gained [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=310.88s)]
*  for the West in Europe, try to add further penalties, but they are, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=316.24s)]
*  and they will be welcomed here in Ukraine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=320.36s)]
*  But what Kiev really wants is America to follow suit by targeting countries [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  that buy Russian gas, by slapping 500% tariffs on. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=327.12s)]
*  That was one of the proposals floating around in the US Congress, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=330.8s)]
*  because the belief here is that Russia's war machine is not being strangled [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=334.68s)]
*  enough. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=339.44s)]
*  It is still able to mount these airstrikes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=339.92s)]
*  It is still able to launch advances along the front lines. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=342.08s)]
*  You wouldn't know it by the weather today, but with the summer conditions, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=346.2s)]
*  that is when this time Russian forces will hope to make gains with armored [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=350.24s)]
*  vehicles and troops moving over harder ground. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  But with drone warfare, we're continuing to see these are frontlines [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=357.76s)]
*  that really have become static in recent years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECZh00EvK8w&t=362.52s)]
