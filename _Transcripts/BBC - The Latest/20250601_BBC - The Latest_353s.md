*  the Olenya airbase which is near in the north, near Mamansk. Well the Ukrainian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=23.92s)]
*  military has released footage which it says shows a line of Russian warplanes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=28.88s)]
*  at Belyiya. It appears to have been filmed by a drone and shows the aircraft [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=33.2s)]
*  exploding. Russian media is reporting the attack in Mamansk but says air [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=37.36s)]
*  defenses are working. Our World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams is in key for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=41.92s)]
*  us. Far from Ukraine's borders an attack of astonishing audacity. Russian strategic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=46.32s)]
*  bombers picked off one by one by a fleet of drones. Ukraine calling this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=54.56s)]

*  Kiev's boldest attacks so far a reminder despite Russia's overwhelming strength [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=65.4s)]
*  in numbers that Ukraine is a resourceful determined enemy. Sources say this took a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=70.56s)]
*  year and a half to prepare. Dozens of drones smuggled into Russia stored on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=76.58s)]
*  wooden pallets loaded onto trucks driven to distant air bases and launched [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=81.56s)]
*  remotely. Swarms of drones picked up on social media from Siberia to the Arctic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=86.48s)]
*  Circle. At a petrol station north of Irkutsk a glimpse of the operation in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=92.88s)]
*  progress with smoke already rising behind a drone emerges from the truck [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=98.54s)]
*  and heads off to join the attack. Moments later another and gunfire as police [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=103.2s)]
*  officers try to bring it down. From base to base the smoldering aftermath [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=109.36s)]
*  testifying to the scope and ambition of the operation. Ukraine says it's done two [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=116.32s)]
*  billion dollars worth of damage a claim impossible to verify. Earlier a different [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=121.16s)]
*  kind of wreckage this the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia after the country [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=128.52s)]
*  suffered another major drone and missile attack. Elsewhere 12 Ukrainian soldiers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=132.94s)]

*  resignation. What chance then for another round of peace talks due to take place [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=142.28s)]
*  in Istanbul tomorrow? Russian and Ukrainian delegations are expected to be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=147.56s)]
*  there but after 24 hours of mayhem the omens for a breakthrough do not seem [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  good. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=157.84s)]
*  Paul Adams reporting there. Well for more analysis I spoke earlier to Mikey K [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=160.04s)]
*  the presenter of the BBC's security brief program. Well Mikey is also a former [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=166.34s)]
*  senior officer officer in the British military. Two very separate locations [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=171.1s)]
*  Virginia one in Mamansk up on the Finnish border but the the really [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=175.78s)]
*  critical one is the one down in Irkutsk which is all the way down to the east on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=179.18s)]
*  the Mongolian border so thousands and thousands of kilometers apart and they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=184.02s)]
*  combine Ukrainians have combined a concept of sabbatharge and just the just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=189.26s)]
*  how difficult it is to not only detect a drone or swarms of drones but actually [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=194.58s)]
*  take them down as well and you know I speaking about this on the Ukraine cast [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=199.3s)]
*  just the other day with Lucy Hawkins you know there's a lot of drone technology [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  out there Ukraine's leading from the front on that for offensive strike but [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=206.86s)]
*  the bit which is really making government struggle at the moment is how [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  do you detect and then how do you shoot them down especially if they're a swarm [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  and we can see from these these this video footage just how devastating the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  effect is you're talking about strategic long-range deep attack assets so you've [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=222.94s)]
*  got an a50 in there which has been hit which is an airborne early warning [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=227.94s)]
*  aircraft you don't get many of those in inventories and then you've got the TU95 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=231.3s)]
*  bear and the TU22 Tupolev blackjack but both of these aircraft can carry up to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=236.26s)]
*  eight cruise missiles and they can fly a long distance you know we see TU95s [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=242.9s)]
*  coming around the northern Cape over the top of Norway and then over the top of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  the UK and all the way down past Ireland that's the range of these assets [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=252.62s)]
*  so to have 40 of them taken out in this offensive drone strike by Ukraine will [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=256.3s)]
*  hit Putin really really hard I just want to briefly ask you because we're [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=261.42s)]
*  hearing reports on Reuters from Russia's Defense Ministry they say all attacks on [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=265.54s)]
*  the airfields have been repelled and they do say and confirm that several [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  aircraft caught fire after those attacks and what about the defense systems then [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=275.42s)]
*  on the Russian side? Well I mean you know the Russians just aren't will not have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=280.54s)]
*  been prepared for something like this in Irkutsk which is down near Mongolia [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=285.54s)]
*  Russians have what's called s400 anti-aircraft anti-cruise missile [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=289.06s)]
*  systems but they're designed to take out exactly that they're not designed to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=293.82s)]
*  take out drones there's new technology in the counter counter UAS or the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=297.3s)]
*  counter drone warfare space which involves laser weapon systems the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=301.74s)]
*  Americans have have trialed and proven a laser based capability the Brits are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=306.06s)]
*  trying all sorts they're looking at what's called RF radio frequency and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=311.34s)]
*  that's basically either taking a drone out with something like RF or preventing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=314.58s)]
*  at least the controller talking to the drone so that the controller talks to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=319.16s)]
*  the drone through an RF a radio frequency and it's intercepting that if [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=322.98s)]
*  you like but it's extremely difficult and governments are behind the curve on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=327.26s)]
*  this deterrence of drones and Ukraine has basically exploited that because the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=331.02s)]
*  Russians would never have expected something like this and they were [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=335.3s)]
*  brought in through cabins on trucks and then the roofs were taken off and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  taken off and then the drones came up I mean this is it's I mean it's genius if [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=342.34s)]
*  you think about just the devastating effect that it's had on strategic [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=347.34s)]
*  assets of Putin [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S56xJXELI&t=350.65999999999997s)]
