**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ)
*  We're here in the centre of Seoul. It is nearly two o'clock in the morning and all these crowds have turned up to see the newly elected president, EJ Maung, declare victory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a few minutes ago he was up on the stage and people here were so overcome with emotion that they were crying. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=10.0s)]
*  He was promising to end the chaos and the confusion that has consumed South Korea now for so many months and that together the country could build back stronger. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=17.0s)]
*  It has been six months to the day that the former president, Yoon Sung-yul, tried to declare martial law here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=27.0s)]
*  EJ Maung campaigned on a clear promise that he would ensure that martial law could never happen again and it has worked. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=33.0s)]
*  He has managed to bring together people from all across the political spectrum here in South Korea, a country that until today was heavily polarised. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Now people are trusting him to steer this country responsibly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y1csHitsQ&t=50.0s)]
