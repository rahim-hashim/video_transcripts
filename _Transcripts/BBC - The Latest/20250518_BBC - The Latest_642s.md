Video Description: Sir Elton John described the government as "absolute losers" and said he feels "incredibly betrayed" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws.

Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be "committing theft, thievery on a high scale".

This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes.

A government spokesperson said that "no changes" to copyright laws would be "considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators".

# Elton John: I would take government to court over AI plans | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU)
*  Sir Elton, Sir Paul McCartney told us it was the government's job to protect creatives, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=0.0s)]
*  young creatives and to protect the people. If the government allows tech giants to ignore [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=6.24s)]
*  copyright, what will they be doing, do you think? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=11.98s)]
*  Well, they'd be committing theft, thievery on the highest scale. And for young people, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=16.4s)]
*  for everyone who's creative, the fact that AI could run rampant without, you have to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=24.04s)]
*  ask for approval and you have to have transparency. It's quite simple. If someone wants to use [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=32.32s)]
*  your song, ask, and then you have to have the transparency and how is it being used, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=38.56s)]
*  that's fine. But the danger is for young artists, they haven't got the resources to keep checking [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=43.08s)]
*  or fight big tech if there is a lawsuit or anything like that. It's criminal and I feel [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  incredibly betrayed. The House of Lords did a vote and it was more than two to one in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  our favor. The government just looked at it as if to say, well, the old people, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=60.32s)]
*  the old people like me can afford it. That's not what we're complaining about. We're complaining [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=65.0s)]
*  about people's legacy, whether they're young songwriters, whether they're young playwrights, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=70.28s)]
*  journalists, whatever. Some people aren't like me. They don't earn as much as I do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=76.8s)]
*  But when they're creative and it comes from the human soul and not a machine, because [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=80.84s)]
*  a machine isn't capable of writing anything with any soul in it, if you've got to get [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=86.72s)]
*  rid of that and you've got to rob young people of their legacy and their income, it's a criminal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  offense I think. I think the government are just being absolute losers. And I'm very angry [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=97.56s)]
*  about it, as you can tell. Big tech has so much money. And if you're a young person and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  you're fighting big tech, good luck. I want the government to see sense. I want it to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=109.68s)]
*  come back on our side, because if they don't, I'm going to feel like a suffragette. The [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  DAB is coming out soon, right? But it's really disrespectful. It's really disheartening. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=120.56s)]
*  I supported the government. I did a thing for them at St Paul's Cathedral when Keir [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=128.56s)]
*  Starmes said, I want to help young people in the music business. I want to support them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=134.56s)]
*  Well, he's not doing it. And I did that show and I did it because I believed, but I'm not [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=139.56s)]
*  believing so much now. And if the government continues to stick their fingers in their [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=145.04s)]
*  ears, what are you prepared to do? I mean, you said it was the Derby coming up, but are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=149.76s)]
*  you not just as one as the most successful songwriters of all time? We'll fight all the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=154.28s)]
*  way, Lord. I mean, if it takes going to the court or whatever, we will fight this. And [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=158.16s)]
*  the government are being so stupid. I don't know who the tech minister is. What's his [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=164.44s)]
*  name? Peter Kyle. Yeah. Well, he's a bit of a moron. Sorry. James, for the next generation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=169.28s)]
*  of creatives then, what does it mean to you? Exactly as I said, this isn't about sort of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=175.0s)]
*  successful existing artists gatekeeping or protecting their own royalties. It's a really, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=182.24s)]
*  really tough time in the creative industries at the moment. Most writers, musicians, actors [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=187.52s)]
*  aren't famous and aren't rich. They're just trying to get by in their tens and thousands. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=193.88s)]
*  But so many are leaving the industry because it is an incredibly tough time. This advancement [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=198.0s)]
*  into the digital space and the online space is not benefiting the artists and hasn't traditionally. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=202.96s)]
*  And therefore it's not benefiting consumers and citizens as well. And exactly as Elton [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=208.08s)]
*  said, it's not about denying the existence of AI. Look, this is here. We know it's definitely [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=213.24s)]
*  going to happen. And there are hundreds of benefits, I'm sure, to many industries and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  possibly even to the creative industries. Well, we're not anti-AI. But when it comes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  to music, London, we are. And how do you see this battle? Is it capitalism versus creatives [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=225.28s)]
*  or is it all about tech bros versus the traditions that we've had for so long? Well, the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=232.28s)]
*  government said we've got to overturn this because of financial privilege. That answers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=238.04s)]
*  your question. It's money. Carrying on from what James said, I mean, a machine can't create [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=243.12s)]
*  anything. It can, but it doesn't have a soul. It doesn't have a heart. It doesn't have human [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  feeling. It doesn't have passion. What machines have passion? Human beings, when they create [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  something and doing it, they believe in what they're creating is something good. Whether [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=257.0s)]
*  it's good or not, it doesn't matter. They're not, they're trying to create something that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=260.92s)]
*  brings pleasure to lots of people. Machines are incapable of doing that. But do you really [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=265.52s)]
*  think that the UK government would be strong enough if they take your side to make Elon [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  Musk and Mark Zuckerberg pay? Well, if they take a bit, you know, it's no good putting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=277.76s)]
*  a Beba Doobie song, for example, and put it into computer safe, write me a song like Beba [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Doobie or write me an article like Marina Hyde from The Guardian. That is just, it's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=287.56s)]
*  just horrible. It's just, it's George Orwell times a thousand. The government have no right [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=292.28s)]
*  to do this to my songs. They have no right to do it to anybody's songs, anybody's prose, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  anybody's journalism, anybody's creative ability. They have no right to settle us down [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  the river. And this is what they're doing. And if Keir Starmer was sitting in this seat, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  what would you say to him today? Wise up. And if he doesn't, what would you do? March [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  on number 10? I mean, I can tell how furious, how worried you are about this. Well, let's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=320.92s)]
*  cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's be hopeful and that the government does see [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=325.92s)]
*  sense. I'm always here to talk. I mean, I've been a supporter of his. He can pick up the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  phone. We can have a cup of coffee. It's always better to solve things face to face. But we [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  have to fight our corner. And I want to say again to the House of Lords, brilliant, well [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=342.16s)]
*  done. You've supported us and you've got another vote coming. We're thrilled that people get [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=346.32s)]
*  it. And it's about time the government got it. And what's interesting is, I mean, I've [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=351.88s)]
*  seen, I mean, I know that I've seen firsthand the value that I think people like Keir Starmer [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=356.88s)]
*  and even Peter Kyle, who was, you know, I've been very grateful. They've come to see a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=362.68s)]
*  lot of my plays. I know that they do understand the value of creativity, both to the economy, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=366.4s)]
*  but also to the soul of a nation, to social cohesion, to getting rid of social isolation [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=372.32s)]
*  and to celebrating British stories, which still remains one of the most celebrated things [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=376.84s)]
*  around the world that we do. I think they do understand that and they do get it. But [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=381.88s)]
*  what's frustrating is the either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=386.28s)]
*  bros get it all their own way. Big checkbook. And every young artist I've talked to isn't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=394.8s)]
*  interested in AI. They're interested in writing their own thing. And let's put this into perspective. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=399.12s)]
*  We're not against AI. AI can do wonderful things. But when it comes to music and creativity, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=404.32s)]
*  let's draw a line here, please. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=410.12s)]
*  Sir Elton, it's rare that we get the opportunity to talk to you. So I know people will also [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=412.44s)]
*  want to know what you are up to next after such an enormously successful career, giving [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  people so much joy. I know you two have worked together on musicals before. Would you be [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=421.68s)]
*  up for it? Or James, are you trying to persuade him? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=426.12s)]
*  Another musical. But the thing is, I really enjoy writing musicals and every one I've [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=429.08s)]
*  written I've really enjoyed, including Tommy Fay, which we wrote together. The thing is, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  from the first initial thought, the germ of the idea, it really takes about eight years [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=440.88s)]
*  to ten years to come into fruition. And I'm at the point in my life now, I'm not interested [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=446.36s)]
*  in waiting that long. We have Devil Wears Prada and Lion King with the number one and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=451.84s)]
*  two musicals in Britain at the moment. So I'm very happy with that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=456.68s)]
*  I love writing musicals, but the thing is, I'm 78 and it's a lot of hard work. You will [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=459.68s)]
*  test if I do that. He has to do the rewrites, I don't. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=488.8s)]
*  You are still producing huge amounts, another number one album, your tenth number one album [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=491.72s)]
*  with the American artist and your great friend Brandi Carlile. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=496.36s)]
*  Are you suggesting that you might be starting to scale back, starting to pull back? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=516.88s)]
*  No, no, no. I will obviously make more records and I have my boys to look after and be with. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=521.24s)]
*  There's so much to do. I'm really glad I'm not touring, I will tell you that. I have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=529.68s)]
*  no wish to travel. I have no wish to constantly travel. But my life is such now that I can [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSswZ65WLgU&t=534.72s)]
