Video Description: A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém.
 
It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.
 
The state government touts the highway's "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.

# Amazon forest felled to build road for climate summit | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM)
*  Now, as Brazil prepares to host tens of thousands of climate summit delegates later this year, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=0.0s)]
*  there is visible evidence that the building work is causing deforestation. Tens of thousands [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=5.84s)]
*  of acres of protected forests of the Amazon have been deforested to make way for a new [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=11.64s)]
*  four-lane highway, as our South America correspondent, Ione Wells, now reports. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=16.62s)]
*  This is going to be a highway, and this is where it's being built. Slicing through the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=27.68s)]
*  Amazon rainforest, protected land until now. Claudio Varroquetschi made his living from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=33.88s)]
*  harvesting acai berries here. Those trees were cut down. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=42.54s)]
*  We no longer have the income to support our family. Our fear is someone will come here [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and say, we're going to need this area to build a gas station, to build a warehouse [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=54.58s)]
*  that will be used by trucks, and then we will have to leave here. We were born and raised [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=59.22s)]
*  here in this community. Then, where are we going to go? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=64.86s)]
*  The government here have made a big deal about this COP summit being in the Amazon, about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  the need to protect the Amazon, but preparations for the summit have already cut down some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=73.86s)]
*  of the last remaining protected forest in this area. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=77.86s)]
*  Most theorists could disrupt ecosystems. This clinic, just metres from the new road, treats [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  wild animals. Most, like this sloth, are injured by humans or cars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=88.22s)]
*  We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, which is the natural [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=95.46s)]
*  environment of these species. It does directly affect the conservation of these animals. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=100.46s)]
*  Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side, too, reducing the areas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  where they occur. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  The state government says the highway is sustainable, important for mobility, and will have solar [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=115.22s)]
*  lighting and cycle paths. It's one of many projects to get the city ready to host tens [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  of thousands of people. There's a new city park and conference centre, hotels being frantically [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=127.44s)]
*  built, the port preparing to hold cruise ships to sleep more people. The small airport will [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=134.38s)]
*  be more than tripled in size. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=141.14s)]
*  For some in the city, this development is welcome. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  I think it's a good opportunity for many people, for tourism, to show the beauties of the city. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  I think the works are being done in a very good way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  I hope that COP 30 leaves a really great legacy for us. We hope that the discussions aren't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=161.14s)]
*  just on paper, but become real actions, so that the population in the future will have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=166.62s)]
*  cleaner air. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  That is the aim, but each move here brings winners and losers. The question is whether [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=173.9s)]
*  the environment will come out victorious. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYtmc2JPIfM&t=179.62s)]
