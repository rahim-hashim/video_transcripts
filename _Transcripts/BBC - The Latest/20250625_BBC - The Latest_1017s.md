Video Description: Nato members have confirmed that they have agreed to spend 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035.
Plans to reach that figure will have to be submitted annually and will have to follow a “credible, incremental path”. A review will take place in 2029.
 
The current target - for core defence spending only - is 2% of GDP, which not all members hit in 2024.
 
In a statement, called the Hague Declaration, members said: "We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty - that an attack on one is an attack on all.”

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to The Hague. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=0.0s)]
*  All the noise that you heard behind me during those headlines was the convoy of cars leaving [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=4.96s)]
*  that follow President Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=9.84s)]
*  He has just finished talking to the media here in The Hague. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=11.64s)]
*  He was in that triumphant mood. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=14.88s)]
*  He gave us a little wave as he went past because he has got what he wanted out of the summit [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=16.4s)]
*  that leaders from members of the NATO military alliance have made this huge landmark agreement [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=21.86s)]
*  which will see countries commit to 5% of their national income on defence spending. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=27.52s)]
*  Donald Trump said this was a landmark agreement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=32.96s)]
*  He said it was a massive win, a big win for the US and also for the West. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=35.72s)]
*  We saw world leaders today reaffirming what they called their ironclad commitment to collective [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=40.32s)]
*  defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, that an attack on one is an attack [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=45.28s)]
*  on all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=52.08s)]
*  We've been watching President Trump speak in the last hour speaking to the media and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=53.16s)]
*  he said now was the time for other NATO members to take up the burden of European defence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=57.6s)]
*  The United States accounts for two thirds of all NATO defence spending. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=64.92s)]
*  Since I began pushing for additional commitments in 2017, believe it or not, our allies have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=69.08s)]
*  increased spending by $700 billion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=74.84s)]
*  I said to people, you don't have any money and a lot of them weren't paying. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=78.28s)]
*  And so I started the process and I picked it up as soon as I got back, which is six [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=83.2s)]
*  months ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=86.84s)]
*  And following my election last November, almost all have accelerated plans to reach the 2%, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=88.72s)]
*  3%, 4% and then ultimately very quickly 5%. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=96.12s)]
*  And all of this is going to be done very quickly, almost immediately. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=101.44s)]
*  You probably know this as well as I do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=105.64s)]
*  I'm sure they've been talking about it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=108.04s)]
*  It's really been a big focus. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=109.44s)]
*  In a very historic milestone this week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=112.44s)]
*  their defence spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=117.04s)]
*  And they said, you did it, sir, you did it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=124.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know if I did it, but I think I did. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=126.2s)]
*  More to come on some of the other comments that President Trump made on Iran and Israel [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=129.2s)]
*  and the nuclear programme in Iran and also on Ukraine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=133.32s)]
*  But let's bring you some of the closing remarks from the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=136.88s)]
*  first. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=140.2s)]
*  Now he said this landmark 5% agreement was ambitious, yet essential, he said, and it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=141.2s)]
*  would lead to a quantum leap in collective defence. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  To ensure we can effectively deter aggression and defend ourselves and each other should [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=148.68s)]
*  anyone make the mistake of attacking. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Allies recognise the severity of the threats we face and in response they have come together [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=159.76s)]
*  to agree an ambitious but essential new defence spending commitment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Our decisions today show from the Mediterranean to the Arctic, from the west coast of North [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=172.64s)]
*  America to our eastern flank, all allies are united in understanding that we need to step [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=178.16s)]
*  up to stay safe and they are acting on it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=184.68s)]
*  President Trump has been clear. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  America is committed to NATO. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=192.12s)]
*  He affirmed that again today in no uncertain terms. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=194.72s)]
*  At the same time, he made clear that America expects European allies and Canada to contribute [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=197.56s)]
*  more and that is exactly what we see them doing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  European allies and Canada will do more of the heavy lifting, equalising their spending [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=208.8s)]
*  and taking greater responsibility for our shared security. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=214.32s)]
*  Joining me now here in The Hague is Ed O'Keefe, CBS News Senior White House and political [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  correspondent, also referred to just a short time ago as not a nice man by President Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=224.96s)]
*  We'll get to how that felt in a moment but of everything we just heard from him, there's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  a lot to go through. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=235.36s)]
*  Can we start with what he's saying about NATO? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=236.36s)]
*  He was in a really good mood, he sees it as a big win, but he's really changed his tune [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=238.4s)]
*  when it comes to NATO. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=242.08s)]
*  He was very warm and affirming. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=243.08s)]
*  That should be no surprise on a day when they finally embrace something that he and as he [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  reminded us many other American presidents have pushed for in the past, which is an argument [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  that other member nations should be paying more into the alliance after decades of American [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=254.44s)]
*  support. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=260.0s)]
*  So that they've done that so explicitly and with such flattery, especially by the Dutch [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=261.0s)]
*  and by the Secretary General, having him spend the night at the palace here in The Hague [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=264.96s)]
*  and then having Secretary General Marruta text him yesterday very gushing about the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=269.36s)]
*  accomplishment they were going to achieve together and then today saying the US has [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=274.92s)]
*  shouldered this burden for so long and you won't have to anymore. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  All of that designed to get him on board and keep him engaged. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=281.36s)]
*  Yeah, but he said he was moved by hearing from other leaders about the defence of their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=284.04s)]
*  country and then he reaffirmed the US commitment to Article 5. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=287.16s)]
*  I want to hear, I want to learn more about how that went because that of course was in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  closed session and we don't see that, but clearly either Ruta or someone else was telling [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  the leaders you've got to tell him these stories and get him engaged and get him interested [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  and invested in maintaining the relationship. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=301.68s)]
*  But it was interesting because before the President spoke, the Secretary General admonished [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=304.8s)]
*  reporters who keep asking, keep worrying about whether the United States is committed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=308.0s)]
*  He said to the rest of Europe, stop worrying about this, they're here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=311.92s)]
*  They've named a new Supreme Allied Commander, he came to the meeting, he's talking in great [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=314.96s)]
*  detail about the situation in Ukraine and Russia, he met with Zelensky, the Americans [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=319.24s)]
*  aren't going anywhere. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=322.84s)]
*  Ask the question of other European countries whether they're going to keep their commitments [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=324.56s)]
*  to being in the alliance. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=328.12s)]
*  So it's been an interesting day where unlike the other summits he's attended where suddenly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  he's the star of the show, he's not the one pushing his way to the front of the crowd, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=333.76s)]
*  remember that back in 2017, he's not calling them delinquent like he did back in 2018, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=337.36s)]
*  admonishing them for not paying more and leaders off in the corner sort of whispering to themselves [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  and ignoring him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=346.08s)]
*  He's not the butt of jokes as they were at Buckingham Palace remember when it was hosted [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=347.24s)]
*  at NATO. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=350.64s)]
*  He's now the guy at the centre of the room, they're listening to him and Ruta admitted [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=351.64s)]
*  it's because look, he won election, he made clear to us this was a priority, we have to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=354.84s)]
*  meet him on this issue. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=360.96s)]
*  To be called out like that, you got the first question, not a nice man doesn't bother you? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=362.56s)]
*  No because look it's not our job to flatter him, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  Apparently that's the secretary general's job and others, our job is to ask questions. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=369.28s)]
*  Being called not a nice guy by him, I think President Biden did similar things not only [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  to me but to others as well. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=378.32s)]
*  Look, that an American president engages with the free press at a meeting like this I think [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  is important to the world so we appreciate his time, he could back off on the personal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=384.64s)]
*  comments about reporters and their organisations but we always appreciate the chance to engage [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=390.44s)]
*  an American leader. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=395.88s)]
*  And we appreciate having you here, thank you so much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=396.88s)]
*  The British Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, has been outlining as well how the UK will [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  increase their defence budget to honour this NATO pledge, have a listen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  NATO allies have agreed a new defence investment pledge, raising defence and security spending [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  to 5% of GDP by 2035, making NATO stronger, fairer and more lethal than ever. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=416.08s)]
*  This includes military spending as well as vital investments in our security and resilience, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  like protecting our cyber security and our energy networks. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=432.91999999999996s)]
*  Allies also agreed that because the threats are constantly evolving, we will review this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  pledge in 2029. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=443.0s)]
*  The new national security strategy sets out our plans and priorities across these areas. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=447.16s)]
*  So under the NATO new definitions, we estimate that we will reach at least 4.1% of GDP in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=454.16s)]
*  2027, keeping the British people safe and strengthening our leadership in NATO even [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=464.32s)]
*  further. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer there, and if I just step aside, we are waiting for President Zelensky [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=472.92s)]
*  to leave, so that's the line of cars you can see behind me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's bring in Brett Bruhn, former US diplomat and director of global engagement at the White [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  House. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=486.68s)]
*  Actually, we're just seeing President Zelensky leave right now, and I think if I stand away, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=486.88s)]
*  we can focus on him. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=491.76s)]
*  Brett, let's take a moment then to talk about Ukraine, because he had a meeting with President [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump, but we haven't really learned that things have progressed further. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=499.0s)]
*  With Zelensky saying they talked about a ceasefire, but President Trump denying that and saying [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=502.68s)]
*  he needs to get on the phone to President Putin. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=505.72s)]
*  And yet, Lucy, I think President Zelensky is leaving a happy man today. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=507.36s)]
*  He got both a shout out from President Trump during his press conference. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  There was that very emotional moment where a Ukrainian journalist from the BBC did relay [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=516.44s)]
*  to President Trump, and President Trump interacted with her about her husband still being in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=523.52s)]
*  Ukraine and the plight of the Ukrainian people. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=528.24s)]
*  So the fact that that journalist's question prompted President Trump to commit to sending [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=531.2s)]
*  US patriot batteries into Ukraine to help with some of those Russian missiles that have [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=537.48s)]
*  been bombarding Ukrainian cities and towns is a significant takeaway. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=543.28s)]
*  And I think as President Zelensky leaves, that is something that's critically, critically [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=548.08s)]
*  important for him to take back to show that despite some of the deprioritization of Ukraine [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=552.2s)]
*  during this summit, he has something that is going to help protect the Ukrainian people [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=558.48s)]
*  over the coming months. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=563.16s)]
*  And he also said that he thought of her husband at the time as well. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=565.08s)]
*  It was really quite a personal moment when we saw that from President Trump as well. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=568.76s)]
*  And yet there is no criticism overtly of Russia in this final declaration. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  That will disappoint many. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=577.28s)]
*  And there was meant to be a new Russia plan before the summit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=579.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=582.28s)]
*  Well, it is disappointing, I have to say, especially since Russia did invade a free [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=583.28s)]
*  European country. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=587.4s)]
*  And yet there was also a line in President Trump's press conference where he said, President [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=588.72s)]
*  Putin has got to get to peace. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=594.84s)]
*  And I think the pressure, as we saw a little bit just in the last couple of days apply [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=598.0s)]
*  to Prime Minister Netanyahu, is similarly now going to come down on President Putin. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=602.0s)]
*  We'll see if it lasts. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=607.68s)]
*  Consistency has not been a strong suit for President Trump's diplomacy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=608.68s)]
*  But the feeling is positive leaving the Hague here. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=612.68s)]
*  I think NATO leaders will feel as though things are going in the right direction. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=615.68s)]
*  The fact that they mostly got to 5 percent, with the exception of Spain, is going to send [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  a strong message to Moscow. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=624.9s)]
*  Great. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=626.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=627.52s)]
*  Good to see you as we continue to just watch President Zelensky have a final few conversations [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=628.88s)]
*  before leaving. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=634.16s)]
*  The conversations will continue, of course, but we're still reflecting, Matthew, on that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=636.12s)]
*  press conference from President Trump as well. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=639.88s)]
*  He was in a brilliant mood, in a good mood after what he will see as a massive win for [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=643.16s)]
*  him managing to bring all of those NATO members. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=648.24s)]
*  The Spaniards he's going to talk to, he said, but everyone else up to that 5 percent. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=652.4s)]
*  Lucy, thanks very much. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=656.96s)]
*  As Lisa was saying, lots to analyse after listening there to Donald Trump. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=658.28s)]
*  Let's speak to the former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who joins us live here [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=662.28s)]
*  on BBC News. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=666.08s)]
*  Carl Bildt, welcome here to the programme. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=667.36s)]
*  You might have heard Donald Trump describing it as a monumental win, getting this commitment [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=669.4000000000001s)]
*  of 5 percent of GDP spending for NATO from the various countries. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=673.96s)]
*  But there is, isn't there within it, quite a lot of accountancy trickery of what will [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=679.0s)]
*  actually count as defence spending. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=684.36s)]
*  So how do you view this? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh, there's going to be a major exercise in trickery in accounting. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=688.64s)]
*  I mean, the substantial commitment is 3.5 for real defence spending, and that's going [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=693.72s)]
*  to be achieved in 10 years time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=699.8s)]
*  That's a very substantial commitment. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=701.72s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  We are around two at the moment. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  European countries have been increasing defence spending by roughly a third in the last few [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=706.24s)]
*  years and further to go, obviously. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  I think that will be met by at least all of the countries in Northern Europe. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=714.12s)]
*  I would have my question marks in Southern Europe. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=718.6s)]
*  I'm not quite sure that the Americans would beat it, by the way, because they are somewhat [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=721.76s)]
*  below that particular figure. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=724.72s)]
*  Then they added this 1.5 in order not to please Mr Trump. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=727.48s)]
*  And of course, there are items that are important that I have to do with resilience, but that's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=735.12s)]
*  going to be a major question of redefining existing public expenditure in order to meet [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=739.8000000000001s)]
*  the rather arbitrary targets that they had to throw in to please Trump. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=745.2s)]
*  I'll come back to that point about pleasing Donald Trump in a moment, but it is so interesting [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=750.28s)]
*  because you see those various NATO leaders signing up and recognising that they have [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=754.68s)]
*  to increase defence spending principally because of the threat that is coming from Russia. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=760.52s)]
*  And then you hear Donald Trump and you never hear those words from the US President. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=770.76s)]
*  Mr Trump is saying this was because of him. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=771.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, the American presidents have been pressing that, it's true, for increasing in [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  European defence spending for quite some time. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=779.16s)]
*  But of course, the number one person responsible for this particular decision is Vladimir Putin. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=782.16s)]
*  There is a keen recognition in a number of European countries that we need to do more. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=786.92s)]
*  And even more important, and that was somewhat lacking, I think, in the discussion in The [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=792.52s)]
*  Hague, is the necessity of supporting Ukraine, because it is the defence of Ukraine that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=796.68s)]
*  is the defence of Europe. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=803.12s)]
*  If the defence of Ukraine fails, Europe is in danger. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  If Ukraine stands as an independent and sovereign nation, then I think the strategic options [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=810.0s)]
*  of Mr Putin will be very limited. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I think he will go down in Russian heifers' history as a distinct failure. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=815.88s)]
*  So that should have been the focus of the meeting. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=820.98s)]
*  Obviously, of course. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=825.1600000000001s)]
*  It is really interesting you say that, because isn't that the broader problem that all these [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=826.1600000000001s)]
*  leaders have with dealing with Donald Trump? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=830.14s)]
*  You think back to the G7 and the watering down of that final draft where it was taken [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=833.04s)]
*  out, any sort of ceasefire press for Israel and Iran. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=839.68s)]
*  You think even further back to back in early May, where you had the leaders of Germany, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=844.36s)]
*  France and the UK there in Kiev on the Saturday giving a deadline to Russia. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=849.7199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump intervenes, and by Monday that's all evaporated. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  That is a huge difficulty, isn't it? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=859.92s)]
*  You're dealing with such a major challenge in terms of ending this war in Ukraine. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=861.84s)]
*  That's a mild way of putting it, I would say. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=866.7600000000001s)]
*  You could go back to what I thought was the absolutely shameful vote in the United Nations [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=869.48s)]
*  where Russia, or the United States sided with Russia in defeating a European motion in order [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=874.1600000000001s)]
*  to sort of criticise the Russian invasion. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=883.32s)]
*  So President Trump has been extremely reluctant to be critical of Russia, extremely reluctant [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=888.92s)]
*  to read any message. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  I heard something now, what was said prior in the broadcast about another battery going [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  That is of course significant if that happens. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  But the fact is of course that Americans are not committing to further support to Ukraine, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=908.24s)]
*  and it will now be up to the Europeans to give the military and primarily the finance [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=914.04s)]
*  and support that absolutely ascension for the defence of Europe as a whole. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=919.24s)]
*  And of course no talk of any new sanctions. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=924.04s)]
*  Final point, and I'll come back to that point about pleasing Donald Trump, because you posted [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=928.76s)]
*  yesterday a brutal social media post, and I've got it there on the screen, about Mark [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=934.16s)]
*  Rutter's private messages to Donald Trump. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=939.64s)]
*  You said, I'll read it out, flattery is evidently the new bond of the Atlantic alliance. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=941.64s)]
*  I guess it replaces the more outdated concepts of common values and common threat perceptions. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=946.1199999999999s)]
*  Tell me more about your concerns when you read something like that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  I can understand diplomacy being diplomacy, I've been in it as well. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=959.3599999999999s)]
*  An element of flattery is necessary. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  I think there has been somewhat an overplay of the flattery aspects of dealing with Mr. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=966.28s)]
*  Trump. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=973.08s)]
*  I mean, he's a man who's sort of, he reacts to flattery obviously. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=974.08s)]
*  But then of course there should be some sort of balance. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  And then in a NATO context, of course what NATO is about is the community of values, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=983.04s)]
*  defending democracy, of a common security outlook which has to do with the Russian threat. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=990.28s)]
*  And now we see a sort of downplaying of the values and a downplaying of the security [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=995.32s)]
*  threat and a survival game in order to please him. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=999.8000000000001s)]
*  And that was successful, that's good in itself, but it can't be the core of the alliance. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=1005.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=1010.4000000000001s)]
*  Carl Bildt, we have to leave it there, but we're grateful for your thoughts, your time [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=1011.4000000000001s)]
*  here on today's programme. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=1014.5200000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXMvmDhy_g&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
