Video Description: A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.
 
Nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base.
 
But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC "there was an assault" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.
 
In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with "utmost urgency".

# Scientists at Antarctic base rocked by alleged assault | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ)
*  A team of research scientists working in the Antarctic have reportedly made a desperate appeal for help [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  after they say a colleague threatened to kill one of them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=6.0s)]
*  The South African team are totally isolated at the remote research base, thousands of miles from South Africa. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Winter is fast approaching and that means it will be months before the team can be changed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Here's our climate correspondent, Justin Rollard. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=20.0s)]
*  The Sun Eye base is one of the most remote places on Earth. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Ten people were preparing to spend the Antarctic winter here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=29.0s)]
*  The base has plenty of amenities as this video tour taken four years ago shows. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=34.0s)]
*  And here we have the games room, right, where all the fun happens. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=40.0s)]
*  But extreme weather and 24-hour darkness meant the current team didn't expect to see another human being [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=44.0s)]
*  for six months or so. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=52.0s)]
*  Now today the wind's about 30 knots and the temperature is about minus 28, minus 29. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Then an email last week claimed there'd been a violent attack, according to the South African newspapers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=61.0s)]
*  The email reportedly said one team member had threatened to kill another, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=68.0s)]
*  creating, it said, an environment of fear and intimidation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=74.0s)]
*  The South African authorities have confirmed there was an assault. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=78.0s)]
*  It was a dispute over a weather-dependent task that required a schedule change, they said. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=82.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound much, but those who've spent time in Antarctica say overwintering on a base [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=89.0s)]
*  can be an incredibly intense experience. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=95.0s)]
*  If you're there with just maybe ten other people as there were in Sun Eye, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=99.0s)]
*  you get to know everything about the other person. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=103.0s)]
*  You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handler points in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=107.0s)]
*  You know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=111.0s)]
*  You know everything about them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=116.0s)]
*  The South African Environment Ministry has said it is responding with utmost urgency. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=120.0s)]
*  But with temperatures falling and the weather worsening as the Antarctic winter draws in, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=126.0s)]
*  getting a rescue team in will be very challenging. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-76dL3QQtBQ&t=132.0s)]
