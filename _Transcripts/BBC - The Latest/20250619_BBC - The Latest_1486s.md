# Israeli hospital damaged after wave of Iranian missile strikes | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc)
*  Israel says at least 65 people were injured in the latest round of Iranian strikes across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=0.0s)]
*  Among the buildings hit on the seventh day of the conflict was a hospital in the southern city of Beersheba. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=6.0s)]
*  Israel says it's targeted Iran's Natanz nuclear site and has also hit an interactive and inactive reactor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=13.0s)]
*  Iran's state media has released this video said to be of missiles being launched towards Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, the news agency says the pictures were shot yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=27.0s)]
*  Among those injured in Israel include a man in his 80s and two women in their 70s who are said to be in serious conditions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=30.0s)]
*  Several missiles managed to penetrate Israel's defense system. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=38.0s)]
*  This is Ramat Gunn in the Tel Aviv area. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=41.0s)]
*  A missile also landed between buildings in Holon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=45.0s)]
*  All the emergency services say more than 30 people were injured in the attack on the Soroka hospital in Beersheba. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=48.0s)]
*  In a tweet, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said terrorist tyrants had launched missiles at the hospital and at a civilian population. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=55.0s)]
*  He said Israel would exact the full price from Iran for the attack. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=64.0s)]
*  Well, Iran says it was targeting a military site next to the hospital, not the hospital itself. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, let's hear from a paramedic who was at the scene. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=75.0s)]
*  As you can see behind me, I am on the scene where a missile struck right in the center of a building complex. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=78.0s)]
*  We have five buildings that were hit by the missile. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=84.0s)]
*  We have one which is the main building and all the other ones surrounding it, which were partially hit as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=87.0s)]
*  We are currently evacuating a minimal amount of patients. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=92.0s)]
*  We have one serious patient with two more with minor injuries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=95.0s)]
*  We still have a lot of work behind me, as you can see, extracting patients from all the buildings, going door from door. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=99.0s)]
*  Our teams are together with the fire department and front command trying to get people out of their houses. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=105.0s)]
*  You can see a house behind me is still on fire. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, the Israel Defense Forces say they struck more than 20 military targets in Tehran yesterday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=113.0s)]
*  Iranian media says Israel struck an area near the heavy water research reactor in Kondab, which is part of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=120.0s)]
*  The complex is commonly known as Iraq. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=129.0s)]
*  Well, it's understood around 60 Israeli warplanes targeted Iran last night. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=131.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is understood to have approved a plan of attack against Iran, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=136.0s)]
*  but has yet to decide whether he wants to go ahead with it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=141.0s)]
*  The BBC's partner in America, CBS News, says Mr. Trump is still waiting to see whether Iran will abandon its nuclear program. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=144.0s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader has rejected President Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=152.0s)]
*  The Iranian foreign minister said his country was committed to diplomacy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=158.0s)]
*  and his officials say they're considering possible meetings with U.S. negotiators. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=162.0s)]
*  Well, Mr. Trump is reported to have approved plans for the U.S. to join Israel's attacks on Iran, as we were saying, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=168.0s)]
*  but it's still to make a final decision on whether those strikes should go ahead. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=174.0s)]
*  With more on that, here's our North America correspondent, Jake Kwon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=178.0s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be an end in sight as Israel and Iran exchange volleys for nearly a week. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=184.0s)]
*  The people in neighboring Syria and Jordan are watching the missiles being intercepted like in this video, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=190.0s)]
*  but the war could spill over to American military bases in these countries as Washington weighs striking Iran directly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=196.0s)]
*  It's a 30,000 pound question. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=203.0s)]
*  Only American bunker buster bombs could penetrate the Iranian nuclear sites at Fardo, hidden deep underground. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=206.0s)]
*  That's one possible target for President Donald Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=213.0s)]
*  He has now approved a plan to strike Iran, the BBC's U.S. partner, CBS News, has reported, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=216.0s)]
*  but he is holding off on the final order in case Iran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, according to the report. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=222.0s)]
*  Speaking at the Oval Office yesterday, the president insisted that a negotiated settlement with Iran was still possible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=229.0s)]
*  Iran was very close to signing what would have been a very good agreement for them, and maybe that could still happen, I guess. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=236.0s)]
*  They do want to come and see us. They want to see me in the White House. That's a big statement, but it's very late. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=243.0s)]
*  But Iranians have immediately shut down the idea of negotiation or any idea of surrender. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=250.0s)]
*  Americans have been helping Israel shoot down Iranian missiles, but Iranian officials warn a direct attack on Iran would be crossing the red line. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=257.0s)]
*  If they decide to be engaged militarily, direct military involvement in this massacre, definitely we will do whatever necessary to protect ourselves. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=265.0s)]
*  Escalation of the conflict beyond Israel and Iran has the world powers worried. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=277.0s)]
*  Russian leader Vladimir Putin rejected the idea of killing Iran's leader and toppling the regime, saying the Iranian people are consolidating around their leaders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=282.0s)]
*  Iran has convened an emergency meeting at the United Nations Security Council, which will be held tomorrow. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=292.0s)]
*  The same day, several of Europe's foreign ministers will meet with Iranians in Geneva, a last-ditch effort to stop the war from sliding further. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=298.0s)]
*  But for now, it appears the real decision will be made in Washington, inside President Trump's war room. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=306.0s)]
*  Jay Kwon, BBC News, Washington. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, for more on that, we've been hearing from Kashir Jannady, who is our BBC Persian correspondent in Washington. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=317.0s)]
*  Hi. Hello, Regina. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=327.0s)]
*  Hi, Kashir. So just tell us what the feeling is in Washington at the moment, given what we heard there about what the White House is pondering. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=329.0s)]
*  Well, there is a lot of speculation here about what President Trump would make of when he, when and what will be the final decision to be made by the president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=338.0s)]
*  So he spoke about his options about Iran yesterday several times during the day. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=349.0s)]
*  And, of course, he was also talking about that if it's still a possibility of, if it's still room for negotiations with Iran. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=357.0s)]
*  And he said that the Iranians have come to the White, want to come to the White House and talk to him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=365.0s)]
*  But he's told them it's late and why didn't they negotiate with him earlier. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=371.0s)]
*  But on the other side, the Iranians have said that they've never asked for talks with President Trump at the White House. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=375.0s)]
*  Actually, they said as long as the war carries on, there is no room for negotiations and they will only talk when the war stops. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=383.0s)]
*  So we are waiting to see what the president's final decision is about, whether the U.S. would attack Iran together with Israel, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=391.0s)]
*  hitting its nuclear installations, including the Fordo facility, which is within the mountain, within the Earth. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=402.0s)]
*  And, Kashir, you've been monitoring Iranian reaction as well. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=412.0s)]
*  So what have we been hearing from Iran and indeed in the media there in response to what the White House is pondering? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=417.0s)]
*  Well, you know, in the past 24 hours, Iran has been dealing with cellular network outage and disruption in Internet connections. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=424.0s)]
*  So actually, there is some sort of blackout from what we've been receiving from inside Iran. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=436.0s)]
*  There has not been that much information on social media about what the situation is there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=442.0s)]
*  But from what we know is that the people are also waiting and speculating to see what happens with President Trump's decision, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=451.0s)]
*  because that could be changing not only the situation inside Iran, it could be having implications in the region, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=461.0s)]
*  because then if the U.S. joins Israel to attack Iran, then the Iranian regime may retaliate and hit U.S. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=470.0s)]
*  may try to hit U.S. bases in the region. Ali Khamenei, the leader of the Islamic Republic, had a televised speech yesterday, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=479.0s)]
*  and he warned the Americans about the implications of joining the war and attacking Iran. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=488.0s)]
*  So there is a lot of anticipation. At the same time, the streets in a city like Tehran, the capital, are almost empty. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=494.0s)]
*  Those who could have left the capital have left the capital. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=503.0s)]
*  Many cities have been, the major cities have been evacuated and not that many people are left on the streets. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=509.0s)]
*  So the situation in Iran is also that of a country that is under attack and people are waiting to see what happens next. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=516.0s)]
*  Okay, Keshia, thank you very much for that update. Monitoring events from where you are, of course, in Iran. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=525.0s)]
*  Thank you for the moment, Keshia Janady in Washington there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=532.0s)]
*  Well, let's speak to our correspondent, Dan Johnson, who is in Jerusalem. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=536.0s)]
*  Sorry, let's go to Hugo Bishaga, who is in the Holon Forest. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=541.0s)]
*  Hugo, you're at the scene now of where some of the Iranian missiles struck. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=546.0s)]
*  Just tell us a little bit more about what you're seeing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah, Regina, so we had this wave of Iranian missiles earlier today. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=557.0s)]
*  Air raid alerts sounded across the country at around seven o'clock in the morning. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=561.0s)]
*  The Israeli authorities said around 30 missiles were fired by Iran as Iran continues to respond to these Israeli airstrikes. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=565.0s)]
*  Most of those missiles were intercepted by the country's air defense systems, but some of them did manage to penetrate the defenses. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=574.0s)]
*  And one of those missiles hit here, this residential neighborhood in the city of Holon near Tel Aviv. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=582.0s)]
*  And the authorities are saying that the missile landed between these two buildings here. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=589.0s)]
*  You can see that the top section of that four-story building partially collapsed. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=593.0s)]
*  The authorities are saying that three people were injured as a result of the attack here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=598.0s)]
*  There is some damage in nearby buildings, houses as well. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=604.0s)]
*  So I think it shows that Iran continues to have the ability to carry out these attacks. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=609.0s)]
*  We've seen that the latest attacks by Iran hadn't been as intense, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=614.0s)]
*  which was seen as an indication of the impact of these Israeli airstrikes on the Iranian military's ability to carry out those attacks. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=621.0s)]
*  And reflecting that, the Israeli authorities yesterday announced that some of the restrictions that had been imposed because of the war were being eased. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=629.0s)]
*  So again, what we're seeing here today is that the Iranian military continues to have the ability to carry out these missile attacks, causing a lot of damage in places across Israel. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=637.0s)]
*  Indeed. And of course, we're hearing more about the hospital as well that was struck, Hugo. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=649.0s)]
*  Just tell us a little bit more about the hospital, where it is in relation to where you are and what more the authorities and medics have been telling us. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=655.0s)]
*  Yeah, Regina. So this is a hospital, the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Bolsheva, about an hour's drive from here. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=663.0s)]
*  And a missile struck this medical center, medical facility. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=674.0s)]
*  The Iranian authorities are saying that the target of that attack was a military facility near this hospital. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=679.0s)]
*  So we've had reaction from the Israeli authorities accusing Iran of deliberately targeting a hospital. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=687.0s)]
*  We don't know what the target here could have been. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=695.0s)]
*  But again, this was another missile that managed to penetrate the country's air defense systems. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=698.0s)]
*  Now, the reaction that we're seeing from the Israeli authorities so far indicate that these Israeli airstrikes are going to intensify. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=706.0s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister says that not only military and nuclear facilities will be hit, but also government buildings, facilities linked to the Iranian regime. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=714.0s)]
*  So here, I think, again, the strategy, as we've been discussing for days now, seems to be to put a lot of pressure on the Iranian authorities, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=724.0s)]
*  hinting at possible regime change in Iran as a possible goal in this operation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=733.0s)]
*  Indeed. Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Iran will pay a heavy price. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=739.0s)]
*  So no sign that things are going to let up, Hugo? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=744.0s)]
*  No, no sign of de-escalation here. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=752.0s)]
*  On the contrary, because now we're hearing from those reports in America that President Trump has decided to go ahead with, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=754.0s)]
*  has approved military plans for direct American involvement in this Israeli offensive, but no decision has been taken yet. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=763.0s)]
*  I'm one of my little bit of context here because it's crucial because this is, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=770.0s)]
*  a very dangerous moment here in the Middle East in which we could see a major regional escalation with American involvement. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=775.0s)]
*  The Israelis have been saying that this campaign is to destroy, damage Iran's nuclear program. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=783.0s)]
*  They've been saying that Iran was getting close to the point of no return in developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=789.0s)]
*  There hasn't been any evidence to support this, you know, this view. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=795.0s)]
*  The assessment by the international community, including from the Americans, is that the Iranians had made no decision to weaponize their nuclear program. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=800.0s)]
*  We don't know whether they had plans to do so, but the evidence on the ground was that no decision had been made. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=810.0s)]
*  Iran says this is a war of aggression, that it has the right to defend itself, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=816.0s)]
*  and has been threatening to target American military interests in the region if there is direct American involvement. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=820.0s)]
*  And so we could see, you know, the potential here of a wider regional conflict. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=827.0s)]
*  OK, Hugo Bishage, Ian Holon, thank you very much. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=832.0s)]
*  Well, let's take you to Be'Sheba, which is where the hospital that was struck was, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=836.0s)]
*  because we're listening to, we're not quite sure whether that's a doctor or some sort of official, but let's have a listen in. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=841.0s)]
*  We will know more by the end of the day and we will issue more statements. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=847.0s)]
*  We've been moving departments since Friday, since the beginning of the war with Iran. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=856.0s)]
*  We've moved all of our unsafe departments immediately, and in the following days we've moved departments that have sheltered areas, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=862.0s)]
*  but we felt should be more protected. So for instance, the war that we moved yesterday, that was hit today, does have sheltered areas, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=870.0s)]
*  but we felt we could do better, and we moved it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=877.0s)]
*  This was not the result of any warning or expectation, it's just what we do for emergency preparedness. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=880.0s)]
*  How many patients are now in the hospital? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=886.0s)]
*  Around 650. Most of them in sheltered areas. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=891.0s)]
*  We moved to formal sheltered areas. Yes, we do have an underground hospital. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=896.0s)]
*  We moved probably around 150 patients who are immobile to sheltered areas several days ago, four or five days ago. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=900.0s)]
*  How do you react personally to that? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=908.0s)]
*  What is your state of mind right now? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=911.0s)]
*  We're working and providing care for the population. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=914.0s)]
*  The personal feeling will take a while, as was the event in the Prophet's settings, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=918.0s)]
*  but it's a total shock that someone would target a medical center. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=922.0s)]
*  The people we have left in the hospital are elderly people, cancer patients, people who need urgent medical care, they cannot go home. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=925.0s)]
*  And these people were targeted directly to be killed by a missile attack. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=934.0s)]
*  There is no other explanation for this, and it's shocking that such a thing would take place. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=940.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=946.0s)]
*  OK, we're just going to leave that. Apologies, the sound was not that clear. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=951.0s)]
*  But a little update from Beersheba, of course, that is where the hospital was hit by a wave of missiles from Iran. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=957.0s)]
*  Well, let's go to Jerusalem and speak to our correspondent, Dan Johnson, who's been monitoring all developments from there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=967.0s)]
*  Dan, we heard there from Hugo and from Kashia, really, how both Israel and Iran are not going to de-escalate. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=975.0s)]
*  In fact, what we've seen overnight just shows how things are intensifying. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=983.0s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. And this intensification, this ramping up of the missile attacks from Iran into Israel seems to coincide with the Israeli cabinet meeting that happened last night, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=990.0s)]
*  which was at the same time that Donald Trump was meeting his top security officials in the White House, monitoring the situation here, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1000.0s)]
*  assessing that plan to potentially support Israel in its attacks on Iran. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1006.0s)]
*  It was eight o'clock here, local time, that we saw the first barrage of missiles last night. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1012.0s)]
*  Then there was a second just after midnight. The Israeli air defences were very active through the night. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1016.0s)]
*  The air raid sirens sounded across the country. People were advised to take shelter. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1021.0s)]
*  And that happened again here at 7 a.m. this morning when we understand up to 30 ballistic missiles were fired by Iran. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1025.0s)]
*  And that's when that hospital was hit in Be'er Sheva. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1032.0s)]
*  There have also been impacts around Tel Aviv and the suburbs of Israel's capital. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1035.0s)]
*  Here in Jerusalem, we heard very loud interception explosions in the sky. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1040.0s)]
*  It didn't feel like anything actually got through here in Jerusalem, but lots of missiles for the Israeli air defences to intercept. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1045.0s)]
*  And that was the most intense barrage to hit this city, people are saying, in the week of this intensifying conflict. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1053.0s)]
*  And it's underlined to everybody exactly what the risk is, what is at stake here. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1059.0s)]
*  Now, I suppose it cuts both ways. And some people will argue this shows the threat that Iran is continuing to pose to Israeli citizens, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1064.0s)]
*  to their neighborhoods, therefore why Israel has to continue its strikes on Iranian targets and why it needs that U.S. support. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1071.0s)]
*  Others will say, look, this is what happens if you provoke Iran and if there is any further escalation in this conflict, we're going to see more of this. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1079.0s)]
*  More damage in Israel, more loss of life, more casualties. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1086.0s)]
*  Around 65 people across the country are reported injured this morning. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1089.0s)]
*  And the Israeli authorities of this morning issued an update about the entire seven days of this conflict so far, saying that 24 people in Israel have been killed, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1093.0s)]
*  over 830 injured and 20,000 buildings or vehicles have been damaged in the last week or so. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1101.0s)]
*  So it's clear to everybody what the cost of this conflict is, but still a huge decision for Donald Trump and for the Israeli leadership to make about exactly what happens next, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1109.0s)]
*  whether they try to push towards some sort of peace negotiation or a deal or whether indeed they do escalate as Benjamin Netanyahu seems to favor. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1119.0s)]
*  That's why he's asked for that U.S. support. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1126.0s)]
*  It is possible that everything we've seen, the increased rhetoric, the ramping up of attacks, is all designed to put pressure on, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1130.0s)]
*  to show force, to solidify each side's position so that they can make a negotiation, they can bargain from a position of strength. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1136.0s)]
*  But it's also possible that this is the uncontrolled escalation that people have been warning about, that this runs away now and that we see even more destruction, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1144.0s)]
*  both in Iran and here in Israel too. That's what people are fearing. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1151.0s)]
*  OK, Dan, and is there any more wider regional reaction, some of Israel's neighbors, of course, and other countries, say Egypt, for example, or Qatar, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1155.0s)]
*  people that have been brokers in this wider region? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1165.0s)]
*  Yeah, most of the surrounding countries have been pushing increasingly over the past few days for a peace settlement. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1172.0s)]
*  And we've heard that message coming from as far afield as China and Russia too. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1179.0s)]
*  We understand yesterday a plane with a delegation from Iran actually flew to Oman, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1183.0s)]
*  and it may be possible that they are in position, ready to negotiate if indeed the Israelis come to the table and there is some possibility of talks. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1189.0s)]
*  A lot of speculation about whether that is actually what's happening, whether that would even be possible. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1197.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says he's got this plan in place, that he favors supporting Israel in what it wants to do, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1202.0s)]
*  but that he's looking to Iran to back down, to come and negotiate, to reach some sort of peace settlement [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1208.0s)]
*  that would keep Israeli citizens safe, reassure Israel that Iran has no nuclear ambitions and no desire to further attack this country. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1214.0s)]
*  But the Israeli leadership is very strong in condemning the attacks this morning, the apparent targeting of a civilian site. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1224.0s)]
*  The Israeli minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, has called the Iranians Nazis for attacking that hospital. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1231.0s)]
*  The Iranians have responded to that saying that actually they were targeting some sort of intelligence or military technology facility that is nearby to that hospital. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1237.0s)]
*  But the rhetoric again is increasing. Israel has promised that there will be more attacks in retaliation to what we've seen overnight and this morning. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1246.0s)]
*  So at the moment all the indications are this is potentially going to get worse before it gets better, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1254.0s)]
*  but it is always possible that this is the two sides going up to the brink before they come back and potentially negotiate some sort of settlement, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1258.0s)]
*  whether that's likely, all up in the air, potentially, or for Donald Trump to decide. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1266.0s)]
*  OK, thanks so much. Dan Johnson in Jerusalem for us. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1270.0s)]
*  Let's stay with the story. Let's now speak to Azadeh Moavary, the associate professor of journalism at New York University. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1274.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1283.0s)]
*  As we heard from Dan there, things just seem to be escalating. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1287.0s)]
*  As your perspective of someone who watches Iran very closely, what do you think the calculations are in Iran at a government level at the moment? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1292.0s)]
*  I mean, we we know that there are pre-negotiations going on. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1301.0s)]
*  There are intermediaries who are trying to broker some sort of preliminary talks and excuse me ahead of possible return to the negotiating table. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1306.0s)]
*  There's a meeting of Iranian diplomats and the E3 on Friday. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1319.0s)]
*  But I think for for any of that to be feasible, for for talks to be restarted from the Iranian side, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1325.0s)]
*  there would be a clear expectation that the bombing would stop first. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1332.0s)]
*  I think it's impossible that Iran would be willing to go back to the table and resume where where they had left off when Israel attacked Iran while this fighting continues, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1336.0s)]
*  if the facility, the nuclear facility at Fordow is bombed. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1347.0s)]
*  So, you know, there's frantic diplomatic diplomatic activity going on. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1351.0s)]
*  The Iranians have been messaging and they're in touch with various intermediaries. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1355.0s)]
*  But the precondition would be for the bombing to stop first. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1359.0s)]
*  Which countries do you think hold this way over Iran in this equation at the moment? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1363.0s)]
*  I mean, some people even talked about Russia and the relationship Russia has with all the players in this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1369.0s)]
*  I mean, I think Iran is is strategically lonely. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1374.0s)]
*  I don't think that there is any player that is capable of pressuring Iran to do what it's not inclined to do to reassert some form of deterrence inside Iran. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1377.0s)]
*  This is very much playing out and perceived and being waged by Israel as a war on civilians. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1389.0s)]
*  I think it's really critical that the framing, the media framing of the sites that are being targeted inside Iran acknowledges that it's not simply nuclear sites that are being hit. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1395.0s)]
*  They have been hitting for the past six days municipalities, water systems, energy infrastructure, refineries, media bases, civilian areas and dense neighborhoods. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1405.0s)]
*  So this is not targeted clinical strikes on a nuclear program. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1415.0s)]
*  This is a war that's being waged on civilians. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1420.0s)]
*  And there is mass displacement of millions of people. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1424.0s)]
*  It's very hard to get casualty numbers. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1428.0s)]
*  But I think the Iranian leadership understands that the public mood is changing. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1430.0s)]
*  Iranians perceive this as an attack on the Iranian nation, on its sovereignty. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1435.0s)]
*  And there is a real sort of patriotic sort of palpable sentiment emerging. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1441.0s)]
*  You know, people feel like their livelihoods are being are being threatened. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1448.0s)]
*  You know, the scenes that I'm seeing in Tehran, what I'm hearing from friends and family, I mean, I covered the Russian full scale. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1453.0s)]
*  Invasion of Ukraine through the displacement of Ukrainian refugees. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1459.0s)]
*  You know, you have a massive civilian population that's on the move. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1464.0s)]
*  Very vulnerable people can't move. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1468.0s)]
*  So I think to the extent that public sentiment inside the country is focusing around that, that gives the government a sense that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1470.0s)]
*  OK, got to stop you there. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1477.0s)]
*  Azadeh Moavani, thank you very much for ending this half hour. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1479.0s)]
*  There's plenty more on the BBC News website. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1483.0s)]
*  Please stay with us. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcBuVbwrQc&t=1485.0s)]
