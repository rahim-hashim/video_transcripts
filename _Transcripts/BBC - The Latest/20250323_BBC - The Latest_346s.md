# What we learned from the 2025 Mobile World Congress | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA)
*  We're here at the Mobile World Congress MWC in Barcelona. Now, with the entire phone ecosystem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=0.0s)]
*  now valued into the trillions, this is a prime location for big companies to make deals and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=13.22s)]
*  show us their latest products. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=19.18s)]
*  As usual, there's impressive hardware on display. Camera phones, gaming phones, pink phones. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm not stealing it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=38.28s)]
*  And for fans of a folding phone, Huawei's latest offering. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=41.28s)]
*  This is the Huawei Mate XT, described as a triple fold phone. It's already had six million [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=46.96s)]
*  pre-orders in China, but at the moment there are no plans to release it in Europe. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=54.0s)]
*  One of the reasons why you're seeing such a big push from the Chinese manufacturers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=60.88s)]
*  here in Barcelona is because they see Europe as a tremendous opportunity. They're effectively [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=65.6s)]
*  locked out of the US market. So Europe, which is an affluent market, a market that's very [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=71.32s)]
*  engaged with technology, is very attractive. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=77.28s)]
*  Samsung display also brought some flexible screen concepts to the show, like this folding [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=80.92s)]
*  Switch-style gaming device. And how about this for a go-go gadget briefcase, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=86.3s)]
*  is also a foldable portable monitor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  But there was one clear flex at this year's MWC, and that's AI, specifically agentic AI, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  the technology designed to make our smartphones even smarter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=102.38s)]
*  Consumers, they're telling us what they want from AI. Gemini, where can I get a copy of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=106.78s)]
*  the MWC stand? And straight away, all the places I can go. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=112.74s)]
*  We took a view that we wanted to not only bring it to our premium devices, but right [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=118.22s)]
*  across the suite of our devices, so everybody has the opportunity to use it, experience [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=122.06s)]
*  it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  Over on Android Avenue, it's all about how Gemini's live video feature allows a user [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  to ask AI for advice based on what it sees, even what colour to paint your pottery. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=135.74s)]
*  That looks awesome. Is it made of clay? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=141.94s)]
*  I think it is, in fact. And I'm trying to figure out how to colour it. Do you see these [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=144.14s)]
*  colour swatches in front of me? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=148.94s)]
*  With Gemini, what we've done is we've integrated it deeply with Android, so it's accessible [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=151.32s)]
*  in a really simple way. What that means for consumers is that you can get the help you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=155.8s)]
*  need when you want it and how you want it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=159.3s)]
*  To get that Mediterranean feel, I'd suggest looking at the blue or the olive green swatches. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=161.54s)]
*  Those colours remind me of the sea and landscapes there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=166.48s)]
*  That really means the ability for Gemini to see the world and hear the world the way [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=168.94s)]
*  that you do. We've integrated that capability directly into the product, which allows it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=173.34s)]
*  to do a lot more for you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=177.66s)]
*  Honor also uncovered their AI agent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=179.66s)]
*  Can you book me a restaurant for three people, 8pm tonight and nearby? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=182.14s)]
*  Capable of checking your calendar, traffic data and restaurant availability to help you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=188.66s)]
*  make a reservation in one seamless step. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=193.1s)]
*  As AI gets smarter, distinguishing real from fake is getting harder too. I tried my hand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=197.26s)]
*  at a deep fake quiz. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=203.42s)]
*  Are you nervous? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=204.94s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=206.7s)]
*  Oh, I like when you're nervous. So, start detection and let's see. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=207.7s)]
*  Have I got it right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=214.18s)]
*  Oh no! It's not AI generated, sorry. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=217.18s)]
*  Honor's deep fake detection tool is already available in China but will roll out globally [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=224.18s)]
*  in April. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  It can detect a fake video within six seconds. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  Do you have to do anything to the algorithm bringing it to a new market? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=233.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, of course. Because every time we train our AI model to identify those defects, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=237.58s)]
*  so we need really big data sets comprising millions of videos and images. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=243.9s)]
*  In the midst of tech giants, there are also the smaller firms keen to build a following. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=251.9s)]
*  London-based Nothing showcasing their semi-transparent Nothing Phone 3A and 3A Pro. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  We're all about offering something different. I think with design particularly, we're able [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=265.26s)]
*  to offer that and stand out from the crowd. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=270.54s)]
*  Is that something you find that customers value? Because this year seems to be all about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=272.62s)]
*  AI agents. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  You're probably the first person I've spoken to about design. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I think people are talking about AI a lot and actually it's a lot of buzz words [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=280.94s)]
*  but actually what is that offering the user? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=286.05999999999995s)]
*  So yeah, we are concentrating on design. We've upgraded camera on these two new phones, 3A [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=288.9s)]
*  and 3A Pro. But also on this new phone there's something called Essential Space, which is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=293.7s)]
*  a kind of a different outlook on AI. It's about productivity, decluttering your phone. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  And so ends another MWC. And while much of it might look like fun and games, events like [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=308.58s)]
*  this can give an indication of what tech companies think is the next big thing. The question [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=315.58s)]
*  is will it work? And just how useful will it really be? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm exhausted. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFChpPDg8FA&t=324.26s)]
