*  This was the moment a Turkish student was arrested by US immigration officials in Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=0.0s)]
*  Rumeza Osturk, a student at Tufts University, was detained on Tuesday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=8.38s)]
*  Rumeza took part in pro-Palestinian protests as a legal US resident. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=13.0s)]
*  Her arrest follows the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as anti-Semitism [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  on US campuses. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=24.38s)]
*  But critics say that the allegations are false and allege that US officials are violating [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=26.12s)]
*  students' rights to free speech and are incorrectly accusing them of being anti-Jewish. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  US Homeland Security spokeswoman Trisha McLaughlin posted on X saying that the student [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=37.32s)]

*  organisation that relishes the killing of Americans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  But it's currently unclear what charges Rumeza is facing or how she allegedly supported [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=56.68s)]
*  A federal judge ordered for the 30-year-old to be detained in Massachusetts and instructed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=57.68s)]
*  prosecutors to provide at least 48 hours notice if they intend to move her out of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  state. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=68.28s)]
*  But according to federal records, she is currently being kept in Louisiana, which is about 1,500 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=69.28s)]
*  miles away. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=74.84s)]
*  And Tufts University said that it had been told by officials that Rumeza's student visa [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=76.24s)]
*  had been revoked. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDYCMjwfaI&t=81.24s)]
