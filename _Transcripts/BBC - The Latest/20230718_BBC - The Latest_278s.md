Video Description: Russia has attacked the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, with residents reporting hearing explosions.

Pictures from the city show damage to buildings, while it is also thought that the port was targeted by drone strikes and shelling.

The city is at the centre of the latest centre of the war, with a UN-brokered deal allowing Ukraine to export grain set to expire. Russia has not agreed to extend the deal, which allows Ukraine to be exported across the globe.

Before the deal was struck in 2022, Russian warships blockaded routes across the Black Sea, sparking fears of global food shortages.

# Russia attacks Ukraine port city Odesa â€“ BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE)
*  And we've also been hearing this morning that Russia has shelled the port city of Odessa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=0.0s)]
*  So let's discuss this further and the implications of Russia pulling out of the exporting deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=8.0s)]
*  Hannah Schlesst is Security Studies Programme Director at PRISM, which is a Ukrainian think tank. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Hannah, you're in Odessa right now. So just talk us through that shelling that's been reported. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=20.2s)]
*  Yes, definitely. This night we woke up from the initially sheikhate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=27.4s)]
*  There were several waves of them around 30 and then around four o'clock in the morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=31.4s)]
*  We had six caliber missiles that been targeting the port. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=36.4s)]
*  And from the sending of those who have never been in Odessa, the port is just in the downtown of the city. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=39.4s)]
*  So we woke up from the very heavy explosions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=45.4s)]
*  As a result, luckily, all of them being intercepted by the but the debris of the missiles fall at the port [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=48.4s)]
*  and damaged a lot of the infrastructure over there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=56.6s)]
*  And that is just a few hundred meters from those versus where previously the ships for the brain being stationed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=59.6s)]
*  Hannah, in terms of the port itself, obviously, President Zelensky would like those exports to continue. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=67.6s)]
*  Is there notable damage to the port itself that would hinder that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=74.6s)]
*  No, definitely not. Luckily, the port is quite a big and there are three ports involved in the initiatives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=80.8s)]
*  And that is not the first time when Russia been targeting the port. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=85.8s)]
*  We have every few months the Russian missiles and drones attacking Odessa, the Chornomorsk port and Pervendly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=89.8s)]
*  So they never stop despite all the obligations according to the grain deal to target the port infrastructure. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=96.8s)]
*  Even more, they manipulated saying that only those versus where the ships with grain are stationed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=103.8s)]
*  should not be targeted and all other buildings in the port can be. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=109.0s)]
*  Definitely absolute nonsense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=114.0s)]
*  However, that is the argument that we heard from the Russian diplomats for many times. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=116.0s)]
*  The same nonsense as the part for the Russian never been fulfilled because there is no sanctions against the Russian grain exports [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=120.0s)]
*  or the ammonia exports. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=128.0s)]
*  If you look to the long list of sanctions, none of them are there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=130.0s)]
*  However, what Russians wanted, they wanted ammonia through the pipeline from Russia to Odessa. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=133.2s)]
*  And this pipeline is crossing the territory of the high intensity combat operations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=139.2s)]
*  So definitely making very dangerous like a natural bomb from the ammonia just in the midst of your grain. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=145.2s)]
*  Hannah, obviously there are stockpiles of grain sitting in warehouses [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=152.2s)]
*  and there are countries and continents that are waiting on that grain. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=157.2s)]
*  For example, the continent of Africa in terms of food security, if these exports, the shipping is halted, is stopped, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  what are the knock on effects going to be? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  There are two effects. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  First of all, it is a huge delays in logistics because now you need to have all the tracks going from Ukraine through Moldova [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  or through Poland to the nearby ports. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  And these ports like Constanze in Romania, for example, they just don't have capacity for the transport of grain. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  They don't have the capacity for the increased supply, even that we are using it constantly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=189.6s)]
*  because Odessa ports are actually most never being able because of Russian inspections to fill all the capacity. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=194.6s)]
*  So Romania ports are being used. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=201.6s)]
*  And the second is prices because when you are taking a jet from Ukraine, push to the ships [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=203.6s)]
*  and the cost of the shipping by sea is much cheaper, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=208.6s)]
*  then now you will need, let's say, one ship is five thousand tracks that you need to drive for one thousand kilometres to a nearby port. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  So that can be quite a significant increase in prices just due to the delivery cost. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Is there any notable diplomacy or discussions that are taking place behind the scenes to try and rectify this? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  We know that the Turkish president is definitely interested in changing the situation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  because he was one of the main mediators for the previous grain deal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=240.0s)]
*  At least at the statements from Ankara, we know that after the return from the Middle East visit, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=244.0s)]
*  Erdogan is going to call and speak again with Putin. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=248.0s)]
*  Let's see how it will go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=252.0s)]
*  We know that Turkey really can do a lot, both in terms of conversations with Russia, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=254.0s)]
*  but also in terms of unilateral guaranteeing of these passing of the ship. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=261.0s)]
*  And a few weeks ago, we even heard the statement from Erdogan that the Turkish navy can be ready to assist [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=266.2s)]
*  with accompanying the ships coming from the ports of Ukraine. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=271.2s)]
*  Okay, Hannah Shales, thank you very much indeed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZODoOcvqE&t=275.2s)]
