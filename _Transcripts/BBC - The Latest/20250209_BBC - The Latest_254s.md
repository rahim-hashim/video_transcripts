*  Yeah, this is kind of what started it all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=0.0s)]
*  Peggy Shue is a TikTok creator [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=3.12s)]
*  who's garnered millions of views sharing videos [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=5.12s)]
*  about get this milk. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=7.54s)]
*  Alrighty, we can go ahead and commence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=10.4s)]
*  Becoming a milk influencer or a dairy queen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=15.52s)]
*  came sort of by accident. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=18.84s)]
*  I posted one video in 2023 about my favorite milk. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=20.92s)]
*  I think I titled it best milk ever. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=26.04s)]
*  I don't know if y'all have heard of the best milk ever, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=28.52s)]
*  but it is the Strauss organic whole milk [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=31.64s)]
*  with the cream top. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=35.08s)]
*  I don't know if you can see this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=37.16s)]
*  If you look in the top, it's just straight cream. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=39.52s)]
*  It went viral. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=43.16s)]
*  I was like, okay, keep rolling with it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=44.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm, nope. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=49.04s)]
*  Shue has gained tens of thousands of followers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=51.16s)]
*  tasting and reviewing dairy products on Milk Talk. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=53.96s)]
*  She's been able to monetize her videos [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=57.6s)]
*  and sign deals with brands. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  In total from 2024, I've made like five figures [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=61.92s)]
*  off of TikTok. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=67.16s)]
*  Strauss Family Creamery featured in Shue's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=68.44s)]
*  first Milk Talk TikTok video [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=70.84s)]
*  and many more since has benefited too. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=73.04s)]
*  The company has been selling organic dairy products, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=76.44s)]
*  including their unique cream top milk for three decades. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=78.92s)]
*  Now since Milk Talk took off in September, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=83.68s)]
*  Strauss Family Creamery says they have seen milk sales [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  rise by up to 20%. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  This has long been a local brand known in Northern California, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  but they say they are now gaining traction [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  outside this region and even outside the United States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=98.08s)]
*  In 2024, when we started TikTok, we had 34 users, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=102.68s)]
*  34 followers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  They were all Strauss employees. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=109.16s)]
*  By the time we finished last year after we went viral, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  we've had grown our base to 11,000 followers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  But the party may be about to end. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=120.72s)]
*  Last year, citing national security concerns, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=123.28s)]
*  the US Congress passed a law giving TikTok's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=126.0s)]
*  Chinese owner, ByteDance, the option to sell it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=128.36s)]
*  to an American buyer or face a ban. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=131.16s)]
*  With the company declining to sell, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=134.04s)]
*  the ban was meant to kick in the day before the winner [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=135.88s)]
*  of the presidential election took office. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=138.44s)]
*  It's not a pleasant scenario, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=140.84s)]
*  but that's the structure of the law [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=143.08s)]
*  that the Biden administration left Donald Trump with. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=145.16s)]
*  As the ban deadline neared, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=149.96s)]
*  users lamented the potential loss. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=151.48s)]
*  Hello? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=153.88s)]
*  Hi, welcome to Six Flags, can I take your order? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=154.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=156.0s)]
*  TikTok appealed to Trump, who vowed to save the platform, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=156.84s)]
*  telling its 170 million American users [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=159.76s)]
*  it was fortunate that he was working [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=162.64s)]
*  with them on a solution. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=164.84s)]
*  TikTok went offline for about a half a day, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=166.28s)]
*  and then it was back. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=168.68s)]
*  Some have called it a stunt that left Trump the winner, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  but not everyone agrees. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=174.68s)]
*  TikTok didn't choose the winner, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=176.12s)]
*  they thanked their savior, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=178.16s)]
*  which is exactly what you do when you're so desperate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  The team at Strauss Family Creamery hopes TikTok [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=184.52s)]
*  and Milk Talk will last. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=187.24s)]
*  It's not a community that we can bring over to Instagram, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  it doesn't translate to Facebook. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=192.4s)]
*  I think it would be a real struggle for us [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=194.4s)]
*  to capture the storytelling of TikTok [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  in a different social media channel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  It's 153 videos, wow. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  I didn't realize I made that many videos. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=204.0s)]
*  Time flies when you're drinking milk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=207.88s)]
*  As for Shu, she's trying to grow her community [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=210.16s)]
*  on other platforms. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=212.96s)]
*  You have to diversify because I think relying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=214.84s)]
*  on just one platform is a little bit dangerous. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=218.24s)]
*  A lesson learned by many American TikTokers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  caught up in a political storm. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=224.88s)]
*  Nice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqVyMgpxN4&t=227.16s)]
