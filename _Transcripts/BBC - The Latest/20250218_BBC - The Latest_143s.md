Video Description: Investigators are looking into what made a Delta plane crash land and flip over at Toronto's Pearson Airport on Monday, an incident all 80 people on board survived.
 
Airport CEO Deborah Flint said investigators will be reviewing the aircraft on the runway for the next 48 hours, adding that this was "not the time" to speculate on the cause of the crash.
 
The Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis skidded along the runway with flames visible before it came to a halt upside down.
 
Twenty-one people were injured, of which 19 have been released from the hospital, authorities said on Tuesday. The two patients do not face life-threatening injuries.

*  a plane crash landed flipping upside down at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=4.96s)]
*  Eighty people were on board the Delta Airlines flight which was arriving from Minneapolis [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=9.88s)]

*  critically injured. However, Jessica Murphy reports from Toronto. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=19.6s)]
*  A touchdown in Toronto that flipped a plane on its head. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=24.92s)]
*  Inside, terrified passengers scrambled out. Moments earlier they'd been dangling upside down by their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=32.72s)]
*  seat belts and had to lower themselves onto the cabin ceiling to get out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=38.84s)]
*  Oh my f***. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=42.72s)]
*  As we made our descent and made touchdown it was just a very forceful event where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  One minute you're landing kind of waiting to see your friends and your people and the next minute you're physically upside down and just really turned around. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=53.32s)]
*  But it sounded, I mean it was just cement and metal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=60.72s)]
*  Eighty people were on board, 21 taken to hospital, 19 have been released. Miraculously everyone survived. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=63.52s)]
*  Audio from air traffic control shows a measured response as emergency services rushed to help. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=70.92s)]
*  This airport just crashed at 23. You can just stay there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=77.52s)]
*  I got no traffic here so just let me know what you'd like to do. We just had a crash on runway 23 here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=80.72s)]
*  They were traveling from the U.S. city of Minneapolis. The tail and right wing of the plane were ripped off by the impact of the landing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=85.32s)]
*  But how exactly the plane ended up like this? Wheels in the air? Still isn't clear. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=92.72s)]
*  This is an active investigation. It's very early on. It's really important that we do not speculate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=98.32s)]
*  What we can say is the runway was dry and there was no crosswind conditions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=105.92s)]
*  It's cold here in Toronto and as you can see we've had a lot of snow which experts say may have been a factor in causing the plane to flip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=111.92s)]
*  We've had two big storms recently bringing with them up to 50 centimeters of snow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  This marks the fourth major air crash in North America in less than a month. The other incidents remain under investigation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=124.92s)]
*  For now though, people are still trying to comprehend what caused this terrifying touchdown. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=132.92s)]
*  Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcTy2yzbpU&t=138.92s)]
