Video Description: At least 24 people have been killed as multiple wildfires continue to ravage South Korea's south-east region.
 
Most of the victims are in their 60s and 70s, say authorities, adding that some 26 people are injured - with 12 in critical condition - as the deadly wildfires have forced more than 23,000 people to flee their homes.
 
The "unprecedented" crisis remains critical and is "rewriting the record books for the worst wildfires in our nation's history", said acting president Han Duck-soo.
 
The fires gutted the 1,300-year-old Gounsa temple in Uiseong city, where many cultural relics were removed and transported to safer ground.

# At least 24 dead in South Korea's 'worst ever fires' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA)
*  South Korea's acting president is warning of an unprecedented situation for his country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=0.0s)]
*  as it battles the worst wildfires in its history. At least 24 people have been killed, with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=5.36s)]
*  dozens more injured. Around 23,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes since [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=10.84s)]
*  the fires took hold in the south eastern region on Friday. A historic 1,300-year-old temple [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=16.96s)]
*  is among the buildings that have been destroyed. Acting President Han Deok-soo said the seriousness [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=23.8s)]
*  of the fires was rewriting the record books with persistent strong winds hampering the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=29.84s)]
*  emergency response. A total of 128 helicopters, 1,100 military personnel, 3,000 firefighters, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=34.48s)]
*  1,100 firefighting crews and 4,500 public officials have been mobilized for firefighting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  efforts. Helicopters from the US military stations in South Korea have been deployed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=49.6s)]
*  to provide support. Every possible resource is being utilized to contain the wildfires. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=54.2s)]
*  Rachel Lee has the latest from the capital Seoul. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=60.92s)]
*  This is being called one of the worst wildfire disasters South Korea has ever faced. It all [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=65.0s)]
*  kicked off in Uiseong County, but with winds blowing at nearly 27 meters per second, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=70.76s)]
*  the flames just quickly spread to places like Andong City and Cheongsong County. And so far, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=76.68s)]
*  over 17,000 hectares of forest have gone up in smoke. 28,000 people had to evacuate and are now [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=82.84s)]
*  staying in shelters like schools and local gyms. And dozens of homes were burned down and even [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=90.2s)]
*  wooden temples and historic treasures took damage as well. The government's gone into full emergency [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=96.76s)]
*  mode. So close to 5,000 personnel, including firefighters, soldiers, police and other crews, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=104.44s)]
*  have been sent in to help. And over 80 helicopters have been deployed, focusing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=110.52s)]
*  mainly on protecting residential areas from being hit. But between the warm weather and those [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=116.36s)]
*  powerful winds, as you said, it's been tough going. And the prime minister said that this is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=121.56s)]
*  a national crisis and everything possible is being done, whether that's emergency funding, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=129.4s)]
*  supplies for evacuees or support for people who've lost homes. They're also promising to take a hard [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=134.44s)]
*  look at how these fires are handled going forward. And officials haven't confirmed the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=140.44s)]
*  cause yet, but there's suspicion that some of the fires may have started from people burning trash, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=145.72s)]
*  a common but risky habit in rural areas. Fires do happen here, especially in the dry spring months, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=151.4s)]
*  but nothing like this. It's really rare to see wildfires lead to this many deaths in Korea. And [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=157.72s)]
*  what's made this one so intense is the mix of dry air, strong winds and warmer than usual weather. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=164.52s)]
*  And to give some context, the biggest wildfire on record was in 2000, which burned nearly 24,000 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=171.56s)]
*  hectares and left two people dead. And the 2022 fire was slightly smaller with one death. And now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  this current one ranks third in size, as I said, 70,000 hectares, but it's the deadliest. Now the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=185.0s)]
*  government's taking about tougher rules on things like illegal burning, better emergency alerts and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=190.68s)]
*  faster response systems. So this kind of disaster doesn't repeat itself. I speak to Andrew Salmon, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=196.44s)]
*  who's an Asia correspondent at The Washington Times, who joins us now from Seoul. Andrew, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=202.68s)]
*  we were just hearing that these fires are uncommon, but how well equipped is South Korea to deal with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=209.4s)]
*  this kind of system? Well, you'd expect a technological powerhouse like South Korea to be ready [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=217.08s)]
*  to deal with this kind of thing. And as your report said just a little bit earlier, these kind of fires [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  are not uncommon. But what is uncommon is the extraordinary weather conditions, almost eerie [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  weather conditions. I've been living here for 25 years and I've never seen anything quite like this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=235.96s)]
*  You know, we are not in the Middle East. This is Northeast Asia. But I was driving in the countryside [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=242.36s)]
*  yesterday, surprisingly high winds, which were actually raising because the ground now is so dry, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=246.76s)]
*  sort of dust devils, almost mini sandstorms, which I've never seen before. So in terms of deploying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=253.56s)]
*  personnel, we've got 5000 plus boots, pairs of boots on the ground. I've read 146 helicopters, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=260.36s)]
*  but this is a highly, highly unusual situation. What's the weather forecast like? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=269.32s)]
*  For the next few days, similar to what we're looking at now. And of course, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=280.6s)]
*  this raises a huge national crisis. As Korea's greatest cultural treasures, I'd say one of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=285.32s)]
*  the country's top five tourist attractions is now within about five kilometres of this fire. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=293.88s)]
*  And of course, the fatalities that we've seen, that is unusual, thankfully, but that must be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=301.8s)]
*  very shocking to the South Korean people to see these people die. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=307.88s)]
*  It absolutely is. We don't normally anticipate deaths in wildfires. I should add, at least one [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=313.88s)]
*  of the deaths so far has been from a helicopter pilot who crashed while on firefighting duty. So [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=319.4s)]
*  let's not underestimate the, again, the extraordinary unusualness of these conditions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=326.52s)]
*  This is not by any means expected, and I'm tempted to say is not precedented. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  The burning of waste illegally has been cited as problematic. What is the government signalling [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=340.12s)]
*  they might do about that? We're not hearing about prosecutions. As far as I'm aware, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=347.88s)]
*  at this point, people are much more focused on crisis control. But if you go to the Korean [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=354.2s)]
*  countryside, the older generation of Koreans do have a habit of burning stuff. Younger Koreans, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=359.88s)]
*  who are perhaps more au fait with green issues and countryside pursuits, don't do this. But again, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=366.28s)]
*  if you go to many rural areas, it's very common to see fires burning in the corners of farms. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=372.92s)]
*  Andrew, we appreciate you speaking to us. Thank you very much. Andrew Salmond from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=380.68s)]
*  the Washington Times in Seoul. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIHS4CiqmA&t=384.28000000000003s)]
