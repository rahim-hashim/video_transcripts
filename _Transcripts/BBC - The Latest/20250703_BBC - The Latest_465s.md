Video Description: Law enforcement is struggling to stop the growing sale of illegal tobacco in mini marts across British high streets, a BBC investigation has revealed. 
 
Trading Standards teams say they don’t have the resources to tackle the organised crime gangs suspected of supplying some of the shops and said the profits being made are on a par with selling heroin and cocaine.
 
Trading standards has described the issue as a war, and that asylum seekers with no right to work in the UK have been found inside some of the shops. HMRC says it costs the country at least £2.2 billion in lost revenue.
 
In response to our report, the Home Secretary said it was a disgrace that criminal gangs are trying to abuse our high streets and said the government has increased raids and arrests for illegal working by 50 per cent since the election.

*  All this underneath the floorboards of this shop. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=74.0s)]
*  All of it uncovered by Alan from Trading Standards. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=78.0s)]
*  How much money is here, would you say? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=82.0s)]
*  I don't know, tens of thousands probably. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=84.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of pounds, one hit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=86.0s)]
*  Serious money. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=87.0s)]
*  Serious organisation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=88.0s)]
*  And hard to find. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=89.0s)]
*  This man told us he helped out at the shop. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=91.0s)]
*  He thought all this was funny. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=94.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=96.0s)]
*  And you're laughing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=98.0s)]
*  No, because there's no something dangerous. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=100.0s)]
*  Only cigarettes everywhere you have it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=102.0s)]
*  Barber shop, takeaway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=104.0s)]
*  Everyone buys one. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=106.0s)]
*  He says many places here sell illegal tobacco. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=107.0s)]
*  And claims some even deal drugs. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=110.0s)]
*  He's selling a drug in a barbershop. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=113.0s)]
*  He's selling a crack in a barbershop, my friend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=115.0s)]
*  Only see this one. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=117.0s)]
*  This one nothing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=119.0s)]
*  It's only like a hundred and two hundred and a box. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=120.0s)]
*  You are seriously not bothered by all this? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=122.0s)]
*  Cigarettes don't kill anyone. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=124.0s)]
*  How much money have you lost here today? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=126.0s)]
*  Maybe five thousand, maximum. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=128.0s)]
*  No ten thousand. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=129.0s)]
*  But this money doesn't go to the taxman, does it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine for the taxman, it's all right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=132.0s)]
*  You think your boss will be happy with that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=134.0s)]
*  I've had a heart attack. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=136.0s)]
*  And then the boss does turn up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=138.0s)]
*  Don't take the camera. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=141.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=143.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=145.0s)]
*  Angry at us for exposing the crime. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=147.0s)]
*  This is what we place. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=150.0s)]
*  You can't, no, no. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=152.0s)]
*  No, no, no, don't take the camera. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=154.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=156.0s)]
*  And this isn't his first offence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=158.0s)]
*  You have just attacked my colleague. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=160.0s)]
*  I want to make myself public. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=162.0s)]
*  He has a previous conviction for selling illegal cigarettes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=164.0s)]
*  People see, look at the people, how many people... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=168.0s)]
*  But this is just one shop, and this goes much deeper than cheap cigarettes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=170.0s)]
*  The look and feel of high streets here has changed, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=174.0s)]
*  and it's a story echoed across the country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=178.0s)]
*  Turkish marlborough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=181.0s)]
*  We sent undercover buyers along one street in Hull and Libby Road. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=183.0s)]
*  Busy today? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=187.0s)]
*  And found shop after shop. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=189.0s)]
*  35 altogether. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=191.0s)]
*  35. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=192.0s)]
*  Selling illegal cigarettes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=194.0s)]
*  I've got too many cigarettes, if you want. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=196.0s)]
*  This one's seven, this one's four pounds. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=198.0s)]
*  This is Anne Libby Express. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=200.0s)]
*  We wanted to know if we could buy here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=202.0s)]
*  What's he doing? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=205.0s)]
*  Go buy a sleeve. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=207.0s)]
*  Too tight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=209.0s)]
*  Blambadumbad. Blasfwundad. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=211.0s)]
*  There it is, he's holding it in his hand. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=213.0s)]
*  A sleeve of illegal cigarettes [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=215.0s)]
*  bought on the day that the name director of that shop, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=218.0s)]
*  Anne Libby Express, has been jailed for selling counterfeit cigarettes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=222.0s)]
*  It is still happening right in front of our eyes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=227.0s)]
*  And in the middle of Anne Libby Road, our research led us to Go New York. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=232.0s)]
*  We heard the shop repeatedly sells illegal cigarettes, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=237.0s)]
*  so we tracked down the landlord of the shop. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=240.0s)]
*  Just so you know, we can't see you, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=243.0s)]
*  but we're going to film this process for BBC News. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=245.0s)]
*  He said he had no idea anything criminal was happening, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=248.0s)]
*  so we wanted to show him what we found. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=252.0s)]
*  Hi, is that your shop there? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=256.0s)]
*  But then we lost the signal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=258.0s)]
*  The phone just went dead, the phone was cut off. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=260.0s)]
*  It says that it was on holiday. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=264.0s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=266.0s)]
*  What are you talking about, my shop? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, is this your shop? What's your name? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=268.0s)]
*  No, just tell me what's wrong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=269.0s)]
*  Just turn to me camera, if you turn to me camera, I'll put him down, OK? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=270.0s)]
*  This man ran out of the shop, and once again... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=272.0s)]
*  This is a public place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=275.0s)]
*  ..we're confronted and told to stop filming on the high street. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=277.0s)]
*  If you record me, I will put the camera down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=281.0s)]
*  Do you work inside this shop? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=283.0s)]
*  Come on, just why are you reporting? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=285.0s)]
*  Because there's illegal cigarettes being sold inside our shop. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=287.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=289.0s)]
*  Illegal cigarettes have been sold inside this shop. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=290.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=292.0s)]
*  We know. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=293.0s)]
*  In fact, we sent our undercover team into Go New York twice over two days. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=294.0s)]
*  Both times, illegal cigarettes were sold. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=301.0s)]
*  Cheap ones, yeah? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=306.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=307.0s)]
*  Do you have any more? Just let me know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah, cheers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=309.0s)]
*  And again, outside the shop, we're warned not to film. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=310.0s)]
*  Illegal cigarettes have been sold from the shop. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=314.0s)]
*  You know a lot of them, actually. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=316.0s)]
*  If you record me, I will put it down, camera. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=317.0s)]
*  Sir, has illegal cigarettes been sold from the shop? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=319.0s)]
*  It's a personal shop, isn't it? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=321.0s)]
*  It's a personal shop, what's wrong with you? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=322.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=323.0s)]
*  You go do it somewhere else. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=324.0s)]
*  This man then asks a teenager in the balaclava to do something. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=325.0s)]
*  I'll do something, anything, yeah? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=328.0s)]
*  I'll call you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=329.0s)]
*  You think you're too thick? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=330.0s)]
*  Get away. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=331.0s)]
*  I know you'll record, yeah? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=332.0s)]
*  He then tries to grab our camera. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=333.0s)]
*  Leave it, leave it, leave it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=334.0s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=335.0s)]
*  The landlord later told us he'd consider taking action, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=336.0s)]
*  raiding shops, searching for illegal cigarettes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=342.0s)]
*  In just a few years, Alan says these high streets have been overwhelmed by criminality. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=345.0s)]
*  How many mini-marts have you visited, would you say, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=351.0s)]
*  on separate venues selling illegal cigarettes? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=353.0s)]
*  I would say in excess of 80, 80, 80. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=356.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=359.0s)]
*  He was too worried to fully show his face on camera. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=360.0s)]
*  He described his job as a war. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=363.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a war you can win. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=366.0s)]
*  How much are some of these shops making, do you think? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=368.0s)]
*  Thousands of pounds a day. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=370.0s)]
*  I would say the money's on a par with heroin and cocaine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=371.0s)]
*  And Alan says some staff are recruited from asylum seeker hotels. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=375.0s)]
*  It's the Kurdish that run the shops. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=380.0s)]
*  We have come across numerous asylum seekers, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=382.0s)]
*  people with no right to work. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=385.0s)]
*  They've got an unlimited supply of shop staff, unfortunately. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=386.0s)]
*  This year, we revealed that the National Crime Agency suspects [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=390.0s)]
*  some of the networks supplying these shops are linked to organised crime, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=394.0s)]
*  illegal immigration and money laundering. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=398.0s)]
*  So this is what we had. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=400.0s)]
*  We paid three quid for these, so they're probably counterfeit. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=401.0s)]
*  Our undercover team, two former organised crime detectives. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=404.0s)]
*  You're thinking every other shop is selling fags for three quid. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=408.0s)]
*  What's behind that three quid? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=412.0s)]
*  People say it's only three quid, but you've got modern slavery, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=413.0s)]
*  money laundering, human trafficking. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=416.0s)]
*  It's just misery. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=418.0s)]
*  All of the shops we bought illegal cigarettes from for this report [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=419.0s)]
*  did not respond to our questions. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=424.0s)]
*  People see, look at the people, how many people... [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=426.0s)]
*  And back at Easy Shop, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=428.0s)]
*  Excuse me, don't record it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=429.0s)]
*  despite the owner facing a fine of up to £10,000... [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=431.0s)]
*  No, nobody can record it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=434.0s)]
*  Just hours after the raid, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=435.0s)]
*  look at what happened when our undercover team went back inside. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=438.0s)]
*  It was open, restocked and selling again. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=443.0s)]
*  It's a lamb, isn't it? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=446.0s)]
*  Lamb, yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a four pounder. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=448.0s)]
*  The High Street crime in plain sight reshaping communities [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=451.0s)]
*  that the authorities are seemingly powerless to stop. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=455.0s)]
*  Lamb, it's a good one. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=459.0s)]
*  At Thomas BBC News Hall. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4yNbC2NAA&t=460.0s)]
