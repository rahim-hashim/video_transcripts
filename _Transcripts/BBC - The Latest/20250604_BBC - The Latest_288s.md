Video Description: South Korean president Lee Jae-myung has pledged to "unite the people" in his inauguration speech on Wednesday.
 
The 61-year-old won a snap election by 49.4% - a clear rejection of his rival, Kim Moon-soo, who came from the same party as impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol.
 
Yoon triggered months of political chaos after he attempted to impose martial law, which eventually resulted in his impeachment.
 
As he takes on the top job, Lee now faces the daunting task of not only uniting the country, but also balancing ties with its most important ally, the US, under President Trump's unpredictable brand of diplomacy.

# South Korea's new president Lee Jae-myung pledges to 'unite' country | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE)
*  Now we're going to turn to South Korea because Lee Jae Myung has been sworn in as South Korea's president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=0.0s)]
*  having won a clear victory in Tuesday's election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=5.44s)]
*  During a scaled-down ceremony in Seoul, he promised to revive the economy, reunite the country, and restore democracy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=8.64s)]
*  So let's cross over to Seoul because my colleague Steve Lai joins us live. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=15.76s)]
*  Steve, good to see you. Over to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=19.84s)]
*  Yeah, thanks very much, Kesha. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=24.48s)]
*  The reason for that scaled-down ceremony that you were talking about is because this came about because of a snap election, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  an unplanned election that happened because of the removal of the former president, Yoon Sung Yeol, from office [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=31.12s)]
*  over his attempts to declare martial law back in December. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=37.04s)]
*  So usually there'd be a 60-day transition period, but there's no such fortune for the president, Lee Jae Myung. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=40.72s)]
*  He started office today. He was sworn in, in fact, less than six hours after the election commission [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=47.44s)]
*  certified that he was the winner of this election with 49 percent and the majority, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=54.0s)]
*  not the majority, but the biggest vote in this election. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=59.12s)]
*  We're going to talk a bit more about what's going to be happening next, and for that I can bring in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=62.32s)]
*  my guest Yoon Jung Lim, professor at Kongju National University. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=66.32s)]
*  Yoon Jung, it's been a busy time here in South Korea with the elections and the speed at which that it's all happened. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=70.16s)]
*  Not wasting any time, the president has already named some of his cabinet members. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=76.4s)]
*  Yes, because as you explained, there is no transition period for the sitting president, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=80.4s)]
*  so he just immediately appointed several key positions, for example, chief of the staff [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=87.76s)]
*  or the prime minister or the head of the Korean intelligence service. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=94.48s)]
*  We see pretty usual familiar names, for example, former minister of unification, Mr. Lee Jong-seok, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=100.0s)]
*  was named for the head of the Korean intelligence service. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=107.12s)]
*  It's important for him to get his cabinet in place and up and running because he has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  a whole lot of things to start moving on. What do you see as his top priorities? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=115.68s)]
*  Well, absolutely, if you think about all this dynamic, very volatile international situation, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=120.56s)]
*  definitely the relationship with Washington, I think this is going to be prioritized more than [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=127.76s)]
*  any other thing, even though our relationship with the U.S., of course, the alliance is robust. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=133.12s)]
*  If I borrow the White House's description, again, the ironclad, nobody will be wondering about that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=139.76s)]
*  However, still we have many important hot issues, such as the terrific issue, especially on the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=145.52s)]
*  steel kind of key products of the South Korean economy. He immediately needs to negotiate with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=153.36s)]
*  this tough again, the president, President Trump. So I think everybody is watching how [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=160.8s)]
*  again, the Mr. Lee, again, the President Lee can be handling with all this difficult situation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=166.24s)]
*  The economic and the tariff issue is certainly one that he's going to have to be working on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=172.0s)]
*  But staying with the United States, it's not just that there's the security aspects as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has talked about wanting South Korea to put in a bit more money [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  in one way as a very transactional approach to the relationship. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=183.44s)]
*  It's complicating. Our relationship can be absolutely complementary. For example, again, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=187.04s)]
*  the President Trump, he's administration is emphasizing the importance of, for example, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  shipbuilding, again, the maintenance, all the things again, that we are very good. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=198.0s)]
*  And U.S. is definitely needs that. So we have many complementarity between the alliance, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=202.48s)]
*  not only about the military issues, but also other those economic issues, too. However, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=208.0s)]
*  we do see kind of potential conflicting interest between the two administration, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=214.4s)]
*  for example, energy issue, climate change issue. This again, the President Lee's government will [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  be more probably progressive in terms of that kind of policies to handle with the climate change. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=227.36s)]
*  Whereas, as we all know, President Trump, his administration is more conservative. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=235.68s)]
*  He already made a kind of U-turn to the fossil fuel. So we'll see in the fossil fuel expansion of LNG, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=240.48s)]
*  exports from U.S.'s point of view, imports from our point of view, can be a kind of, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=249.04s)]
*  one of the major topics to discuss on. There's lots of areas for collaboration, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  and agreement, but lots of things have to be worked out. And now that South Korea has a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=261.2s)]
*  president in place, it was sworn in this morning, are they going to be able to move on those things? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=265.36s)]
*  Thanks very much, Yu Jong-min, Professor at Kongju National University. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=269.68s)]
*  Yeah, so Kesha, it's been a busy day here in South Korea, and many more busy days ahead, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=273.92s)]
*  certainly for President Lee, as he looks to get his cabinet in place and take action on a long [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  to-do list that has been growing since the six months of turmoil here in South Korea. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbJnOrr5lDE&t=283.44s)]
