Video Description: The US will abandon trying to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs a truce can be reached, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned.
 
Rubio said the US wanted to help end the war but was willing to move on if there were no immediate signs of progress.
 
"We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end," he said, adding that the US had "other priorities to focus on".
 
His comments come just hours after Ukraine took the first step towards signing a minerals deal with Washington that intends to set up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction.

# US will 'move on' from Ukraine peace talks if no progress soon, says Marco Rubio | BBC News

*  The US Secretary of State has warned that America could stop trying to broker a peace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=0.0s)]
*  deal between Russia and Ukraine if there are no signs of progress in the next few days. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=4.48s)]
*  French diplomats had said talks between the United States, European powers and Ukraine in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=9.92s)]
*  Paris yesterday made excellent progress. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the talks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=14.96s)]
*  about a potential ceasefire had been encouraging. Along with envoy Steve Witkoff, he was meeting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=20.72s)]
*  the French President Emmanuel Macron as well as representatives from other European countries. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=26.56s)]
*  Before departing from Paris, Marco Rubio said America will decide within days if Ukraine's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  ceasefire is doable. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=37.76s)]
*  At the highest level of the government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=56.56s)]
*  We are now reaching a point where we need to decide and determine whether this is even [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=61.92s)]
*  possible or not, which is why we're engaging both sides. You know, Ambassador Witkoff has had not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=66.48s)]
*  one, not two, but three meetings with Vladimir Putin to determine the Russian perspective on this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  and understand what it would take for them to end it. We, General Kellogg, myself and others, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  have had repeated engagements with the Ukrainians. So we came here yesterday to sort of begin to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=83.28s)]
*  talk about more specific outlines of what it might take to end the war, to try to figure out very [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=88.56s)]
*  soon, and I'm talking about a matter of days, not a matter of weeks, whether or not this is a war [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  that can be ended. If it can, we're prepared to do whatever we can to facilitate that and make [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=98.88s)]
*  sure that it happens, that it ends in a durable and just way. If it's not possible, if we're so far [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president's probably at a point where [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=110.08s)]
*  he's going to say, well, we're done. Marco Rubio's comments come as Ukraine says that it has signed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=114.16s)]
*  a memorandum of intent on a minerals deal with the United States. The economy minister said the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=119.92s)]
*  outline agreement paved the way for what she called an economic partnership agreement. Yulia [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Sivridenko announced the signing on social media but didn't provide any further details. The move [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=130.8s)]
*  is a step towards a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukraine's critical minerals [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=136.96s)]
*  as well as oil and gas. Previous reports indicated that an investment fund would be set up for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=141.68s)]
*  Ukraine's reconstruction and would be managed by Kyiv and Washington. President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=146.88s)]
*  had been hoping to use the deal to secure a U.S. security guarantee in his country in the event of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=152.88s)]
*  a ceasefire deal with Russia. I spoke to our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse who's in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=158.72s)]
*  Odessa starting with those comments from the U.S. Secretary of State over a peace deal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=164.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the standout comments are that he said the president could say he's done. If there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=169.2s)]
*  are no signs for the U.S. of progress, if it seems that peace can't be achieved, he, Marco Rubio, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=175.84s)]
*  said Donald Trump has other priorities around the world and it seems that America will stop [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=183.44s)]
*  trying to broker a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia if there aren't any more positive signs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=189.84s)]
*  So what does that mean for Ukraine? Well, Ukraine has engaged in America's timetable and vision for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=197.28s)]
*  peace since a few notable flare-ups early on in Donald Trump's second term. But where America's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=204.0s)]
*  patience has been tested has been with Russia which has added more and more conditions to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=212.16s)]
*  how it would like a ceasefire to be reached but also how it's maintained its sizeable demands, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=218.0s)]
*  the complete control of four Ukrainian territories and the political capitulation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=225.52s)]
*  of Ukraine. To the frustration of Kiev, that impatience has not been followed up with any [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=230.88s)]
*  kind of condemnation really from Washington nor further measures such as sanctions. I think it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=236.8s)]
*  is a faint hope that the comments of Marco Rubio could be an attempt to apply pressure on Moscow but [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=242.64s)]
*  what is more likely as a scenario here is that this could be a perilous moment for Ukraine [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=248.4s)]
*  politically when you consider that no more American military aid is set to arrive and that Russia, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=253.44s)]
*  a lack of a ceasefire continues to suit Russia more in this war of attrition where it is the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=260.56s)]
*  bigger force and if it's fighting Ukraine with only the help of Europe then I think you'll see [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=266.4s)]
*  the Kremlin rigorously pursue its goal of trying to take as much Ukrainian territory as possible [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=271.04s)]
*  as it continues to do today. So why does this minerals deal fit into this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=277.2s)]
*  Well if you take the comments of Marco Rubio and then look at this minerals deal it increasingly [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=284.24s)]
*  looks like more of a commercial arrangement than a meaningful piece of apparatus for peace because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  for Ukraine yes this does pave the way for sizeable American investment but it does not have concrete [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  security guarantees where America would step in if a ceasefire is broken in the future and it seems [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=304.4s)]
*  they have at least bowed to Donald Trump's claim that the mere presence of American companies here [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=309.84s)]
*  would stop Russia from upping its aggression in the future but that didn't exactly stop it in 2022 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=315.28s)]
*  but of course Ukraine does need to recover one day when this war ends but I think if America is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  willing to turn its back on ceasefire negotiations whilst agreeing to this mineral framework if you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=330.0s)]
*  like then it poses the question as to whether Donald Trump truly cares whether he's dealing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=338.72s)]
*  with for example a Russian puppet regime here in Ukraine or a sovereign independent country albeit [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=345.28s)]
*  an embattled one it really does pose that question because the consensus certainly politically is that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=352.8s)]
*  without America Europe and Ukraine will struggle to plug any gap and that would make any ceasefire [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=359.28s)]
*  all the more fragile so there's a lot of contradictions going around this morning but I think [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=367.11999999999995s)]
*  it is clear that if America is running out of patience and that it's failed on its self-imposed [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  deadlines of a day to end this war then a hundred days to end this war clearly it isn't it has been [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  frustrated in failing to achieve those goals and if it does turn its back it is Ukraine which will [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  feel the full impact of that decision [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNmy5HP420k&t=389.2s)]
