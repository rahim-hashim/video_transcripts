# Attacker pleads guilty to triple murder in Southport, UK | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk)
*  You are watching BBC News and we'll bring you continuing coverage of this breaking news story that the British man accused of the Southport attack in which three young girls were stabbed to death has changed his plea on the first day of his trial, pleading guilty to all charges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=0.0s)]
*  Axel Rudekabana, who is 18, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to murdering three young girls. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=18.0s)]
*  He also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of eight other children and to the attempted murder of Leanne Lucas and Jonathan Hayes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=28.0s)]
*  Alice de Silva Aguirre, who was nine years old, Bebe King, who was six years old and seven-year-old Elsie Stankham, was stabbed to death at that Taylor Swift themed dance class on the 29th of July in 2024. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=37.0s)]
*  A distressing story. So just to warn you, some of the next details in the report may be upsetting. In this report from our special correspondent Judith Moritz. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=54.0s)]
*  Summer in Southport at the start of the school holidays. It should have been the happiest of places. Instead, horror visited this town. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=67.0s)]
*  At a holiday club, children had been dancing when music and laughter turned to screams and then silence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=80.0s)]
*  Six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Stankham, aged seven, and Alice Aguirre, who was nine, were all murdered. Eight other children lay wounded and two adults were also attacked, including Leanne Lucas, who'd been teaching the group. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=89.0s)]
*  They were stabbed by a teenager barely out of childhood himself. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=104.0s)]
*  This is Axel Ruda-Cabana dressed as Doctor Who in a 2018 children in need promotion. The charity says it has no affiliation with him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=109.0s)]
*  Now 18, Ruda-Cabana has pleaded guilty to the murders, attempted murders and other related charges. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=118.0s)]
*  The teenager's issues with violence started when he was young. He was expelled from this school at the age of 13 and on one occasion was seen swinging a hockey stick around. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=125.0s)]
*  Breaking another child's wrist and having to be restrained by a teacher. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=136.0s)]
*  A picture starting to emerge of issues within Axel Ruda-Cabana's past. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=141.0s)]
*  Neighbours have told us that the police visited the family home here on several occasions in the couple of months leading up to the attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=146.0s)]
*  On the day of the murders, a doorbell camera captured him pacing up and down outside his house before catching a taxi to the scene. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=154.0s)]
*  Despite the heat of summer, his hood is up and he's wearing a face mask. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=162.0s)]
*  When police later raided the house, they found a suspicious substance which was tested and found to be the poison ricin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=167.0s)]
*  It wasn't used in the stabbing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=174.0s)]
*  Ruda-Cabana had also downloaded a study of the Al-Qaeda training manual, which is an offence under the Terrorism Act. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=176.0s)]
*  But the Southport attack has not been declared a terrorist incident. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=183.0s)]
*  Both discoveries led to extra charges which were announced by Merseyside's chief constable. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=187.0s)]
*  I recognise that these new charges may lead to speculation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=192.0s)]
*  The matter for which Axel Ruda-Cabana has been charged under the Terrorism Act does not require motive to be established. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=197.0s)]
*  For a matter to be declared as a terrorist incident, motivation would need to be established. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=207.0s)]
*  I would strongly advise anyone against speculating as to the motivation in this case. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=213.0s)]
*  Riots broke out across England in the days following the attack after online disinformation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=220.0s)]
*  suggesting that the culprit was an illegal immigrant. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=226.0s)]
*  In fact, Ruda-Cabana was born in Cardiff. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=229.0s)]
*  The police say they don't know why he went on his stabbing spree. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=233.0s)]
*  He'll be sentenced at a later point. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=237.0s)]
*  Judith Moritz, BBC News. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=240.0s)]
*  So just to remind you that we have breaking news and we're going to be continuing to follow this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=242.0s)]
*  This breaking news that the British man who was accused of the Southport attack [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=250.0s)]
*  in which three young girls were stabbed, was not a terrorist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=255.0s)]
*  The latest of the Southport attack in which three young girls were stabbed to death [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=259.0s)]
*  has changed his plea on the first day of his trial. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=263.0s)]
*  Alex Ruda-Cabana, who is now 18 years old, has pleaded guilty to all charges. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=268.0s)]
*  Well, Nick Garnett is at Liverpool Crown Court and we can cross over there live. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=275.0s)]
*  Nick, so just bring us up to date in terms of this breaking news [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=280.0s)]
*  and we're going to be following this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=285.0s)]
*  The judge, Mr. Jaster, is just coming into us now within the past few minutes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=288.0s)]
*  This has taken everyone by surprise. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=293.0s)]
*  Everyone was expecting a full trial for lasting for probably two or three weeks to take place. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=297.0s)]
*  This was the first day of that trial and was due to only be held up [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=303.0s)]
*  to involve itself in the selection of a jury. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=308.0s)]
*  The court was to be read out to Axel Ruda-Cabana. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=312.0s)]
*  There was a delay of about one hour in court. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=315.0s)]
*  It was due to start at about 10.30. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=318.0s)]
*  At 11.30 we were allowed into court and into a special annex that has been set up [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=320.0s)]
*  because so many journalists wanted to be here today. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=325.0s)]
*  When that started, it became very clear, very clear, very quickly [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=328.0s)]
*  that Ruda-Cabana was changing his pleas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=333.0s)]
*  As the charges were read out to him, the clerk of the court said, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=337.0s)]
*  changing your plea to guilty. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=341.0s)]
*  And this was accepted by him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=343.0s)]
*  Now, right the way throughout this, Ruda-Cabana has refused to speak in court. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=345.0s)]
*  But he intimated that that was the case. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=350.0s)]
*  And that was what happened with every single charge. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=352.0s)]
*  So let's go through those charges because it's important. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=355.0s)]
*  He was charged and convicted of the murder of BB King, who was six years old, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=358.0s)]
*  Elsie Dot Stankham, who was seven years old, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=362.0s)]
*  and Alice de Silva Aglia, who was nine years old. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=365.0s)]
*  Now, on top of murdering those three children at a dance class in Southport, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=369.0s)]
*  just as the summer holidays were getting underway in England, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=373.0s)]
*  eight more children who were at the dance class were also injured. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=376.0s)]
*  Five of them were critically injured. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=380.0s)]
*  He was charged with the attempted murder of all of them, as well as two adults, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=382.0s)]
*  one of the people who was taking the class and a passerby who came to try and help. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=386.0s)]
*  And he was convicted of the attempted murder of them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=391.0s)]
*  He was charged with possessing a bladed knife, a curved kitchen knife. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=394.0s)]
*  And he was also found guilty by admitting it of production of a toxic agent, namely ricin. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=399.0s)]
*  And this is a complicated charge, so I'm going to read it out from my notes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=407.0s)]
*  Now, that was found on a computer, and he was charged with that offense in October and pleaded guilty today. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=424.0s)]
*  Now, as the trial, as it got underway, it became clear, as the charges started to change, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=430.0s)]
*  that he was pleading guilty to all of these. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=436.0s)]
*  Now, afterwards, he went and sat down in the dock. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=438.0s)]
*  In fact, he never stood up in the dock, I don't think. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=442.0s)]
*  And Mr Justice Goose, who was the trial judge, said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=445.0s)]
*  And those who sit with me say you have nodded your head to indicate that you can hear what I'm saying. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=448.0s)]
*  You have now pleaded guilty to this indictment, to each of the charges upon it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=455.0s)]
*  You will be sentenced on Thursday. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=459.0s)]
*  You will understand that it's inevitable. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=461.0s)]
*  That sentence I impose on you will mean a life sentence equivalent. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=463.0s)]
*  In the meantime, you will go with the officers and you will be produced at that hearing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=467.0s)]
*  Take him down. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=471.0s)]
*  At that point, the judge carried on, and this was a really important case. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=472.0s)]
*  And this was a really important thing and shows you just how much of a surprise this was. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=476.0s)]
*  The judge said, I'm conscious that the families aren't here today [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=481.0s)]
*  because they'd assumed the case would open tomorrow morning and the trial would begin then. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=485.0s)]
*  We'd all assumed that, he said. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=489.0s)]
*  They were not here to hear him enter his pleas. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=491.0s)]
*  Our apologies to them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=494.0s)]
*  So that's the court apologizing to the families of the children who were murdered [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=495.0s)]
*  and those who he tried to attack and kill as well. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=500.0s)]
*  As he said that they weren't here at this because we thought that today was simply going to be a day [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=505.0s)]
*  when the jury was sworn in, when legal argument and discussion about the case would take place. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=511.0s)]
*  But instead, Axel Rudekibana came into court, 18 years old, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=516.0s)]
*  a man from Banks in Lancashire and pleaded guilty to all the charges put to him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=520.0s)]
*  Nick, obviously a very distressing case and it had repercussions across the country. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=526.0s)]
*  But just in terms of what happened in court, Judith Moritz, our colleague, was reporting from court [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=532.0s)]
*  and she writes that Axel Rudekibana had his face covered with a PPE COVID mask. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=538.0s)]
*  He refused to stand and speak his name and then answered very quietly [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=544.0s)]
*  and muffled guilty to each of those counts that you outline. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=549.0s)]
*  Just back in December, he pleaded not guilty. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=554.0s)]
*  He pleaded not guilty on his behalf for the charges of murder and attempted murder. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=558.0s)]
*  A most distressing case, Nick. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=562.0s)]
*  Absolutely. He has shown throughout the whole legal process disdain for everything involved. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=566.0s)]
*  He refused to stand, he refused to take part at one hearing that I saw him at. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=572.0s)]
*  He rocked gently from side to side but still would not speak to the court. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=578.0s)]
*  Now, that is his right to do that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=583.0s)]
*  There have been cases in the past, haven't there, where people have actually refused to turn up in court. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=586.0s)]
*  But today, this was where he could not hide anymore. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=591.0s)]
*  He had to be there in court and he was brought into the court, refused to speak, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=595.0s)]
*  and as you say, mumbled those changes of plea, which were then relayed by the court itself, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=600.0s)]
*  by the clerk of the court, to the judge, that he was changing his plea on each and every count [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=605.0s)]
*  and was convicted of those. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=611.0s)]
*  I have to say, the level of surprise at this, on Friday, Merseyside police, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=614.0s)]
*  which is the police authority that's been dealing with this, held a briefing for journalists. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=619.0s)]
*  It went on for more than two hours. There was full discussion and at that point, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=624.0s)]
*  no idea whatsoever that this was going to happen, that he was going to change his pleas. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=628.0s)]
*  But after an hour of legal argument and legal discussion this morning [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=632.0s)]
*  and the prosecution and the judge, this is what's happened in court today. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=636.0s)]
*  Now, where this leaves the families, as I say, the families were not here in court. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=641.0s)]
*  They weren't here to hear what was happening and in some way to be part of the process. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=645.0s)]
*  And that has taken them by surprise. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=652.0s)]
*  The judge, Mr Justice Goose, has accepted that and apologized to them that that was the case. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=654.0s)]
*  He didn't know what was going to happen either. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=658.0s)]
*  But in some ways it adds to the pain of this, that this is just so much agony for the families. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=661.0s)]
*  Southport is a small town. It sits on the northwest coast of England [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=669.0s)]
*  and it's a very, very tranquil place, I'd say that mildly. It's very, very quiet. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=675.0s)]
*  And so everybody knows people there. In the middle of the town, in one of the theaters [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=683.0s)]
*  and the civic center in the town, there is a book of remembrance. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=689.0s)]
*  And it is so full of people who've just traveled to the town since last summer and put their names in. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=692.0s)]
*  There are flowers left outside still every day. There are flowers being left there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=699.0s)]
*  This is a town that's still hurting, that is still grieving. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=703.0s)]
*  And now these changes of plea, well, it means that they won't have to go through the pain of hearing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=707.0s)]
*  exactly what happened on that day. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=712.0s)]
*  But it also means that Rudi Kavanaugh in some ways gets away with having to confront what he did [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=714.0s)]
*  and the horrors of what he did last summer. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=721.0s)]
*  Nick Garnett, joining us live from Liverpool Crown Court. Thank you so much. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACFA7YfisAk&t=723.0s)]
