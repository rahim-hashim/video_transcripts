Video Description: Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons.
 
Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington.
 
A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds.
 
It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group.
 
It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza, with the UN agency warning that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is "likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities".

# Hamas rejects Israeli ceasefire disarmament proposal, Palestinian official says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M)
*  Now to the Middle East, Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=0.0s)]
*  in exchange for the release of half of the Israeli hostages and the group's disarmament. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=5.44s)]
*  A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks led by the Hamas's chief negotiator in Cairo [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=10.48s)]
*  has told the BBC that the Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=16.8s)]
*  explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=21.68s)]
*  or withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=27.12s)]
*  The official accused Israel of stalling for time seeking only to retrieve the hostages while [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=31.92s)]
*  prolonging the war, a position Hamas finds unacceptable. So let's talk to our Middle East [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=36.56s)]
*  correspondent Yelann El who's live in Jerusalem. Yelann, just talk us through where we are with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=41.52s)]
*  this rejection from Hamas. I mean basically still we're far from any breakthrough in the ongoing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=46.32s)]
*  ceasefire efforts, efforts to end the war in Gaza. We knew that last week Israel had put forward [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=56.08s)]
*  a new proposal via regional mediators, had been working with the US on that. We understood that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  it demanded a lower number of hostages than Israel had previously asked for, eight or nine, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=71.44s)]
*  to be returned in exchange for a new six-week ceasefire. But now what we've heard from a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=78.0s)]
*  senior Palestinian official that really there's been no sign that Hamas can agree to this. It's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=85.84s)]
*  saying that there is this new condition being attached by Israel for Hamas disarmament. That [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  is something which is really seen as being a red line for the group. He said there was no commitment [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=100.16s)]
*  to end the war or for this full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Those have been key Hamas [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=107.2s)]
*  demands to return the remaining 24 living hostages it's believed to be holding. They have been [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=112.72s)]
*  kept underground in Gaza, we understand. They've been there now for 18 months. Hamas previously [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=121.84s)]
*  had offered to free only five of those hostages as part of a new ceasefire extension deal. But [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=129.52s)]
*  this official did say to the BBC that Hamas was showing flexibility about the numbers. What we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=136.56s)]
*  understand is that now Egypt has submitted a modified proposal to the group and that it is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=143.2s)]
*  considering that. Yolande, as always, good to get that update from you. Yolande, now there in Jerusalem. Thank you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUSdPjsvw7M&t=149.92000000000002s)]
