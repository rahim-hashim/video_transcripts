# Liverpool parade crash: Suspect arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, police say | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM)
*  Just after 6pm, the joy of the day dissipated quickly. After more than 50 people were injured, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=0.0s)]
*  when a car collided with people gathered on Water Street. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=8.16s)]
*  We had worked extensively with event organisers and key partner agencies in the months ahead [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=13.96s)]
*  of the potential parade. And a robust traffic management plan was in place, which included [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  a number of local authority road closures throughout the route and the city centre. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=27.4s)]
*  This included Water Street, which was closed to traffic. It is believed the driver of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=34.32s)]
*  Ford Galaxy car involved in this incident was able to follow an ambulance onto Water [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=40.96s)]
*  Street after the roadblock was temporarily lifted, so that the ambulance crew could attend [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=47.4s)]
*  to a member of the public who was having a suspected heart attack. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=54.28s)]
*  As with many large events, with event organisers we planned for all contingencies. And this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=59.72s)]
*  included the implementation of road closures to protect pedestrians and an armed policing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=65.6s)]
*  presence was also in place throughout the day. There was no intelligence to suggest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=71.42s)]
*  an incident of this nature would take place. And as we previously stated, the incident [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=78.52s)]
*  is not being treated as terrorism. An extensive investigation into the precise [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=84.44s)]
*  circumstances of the incident is ongoing. And we continue to ask people not to speculate [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=91.44s)]
*  on the circumstances surrounding the incident and refrain from sharing distressing content [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=98.11999999999999s)]

*  who were injured, their family and friends. And for those who witnessed the incident unfolding [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=112.4s)]
*  in front of them. It is so heartening to hear that the public has also recognised the human [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=119.44s)]
*  impact on our attending officers, staff and other emergency service colleagues from North [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=126.2s)]

*  Following the incident yesterday, I can confirm on behalf of the National Health Service that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  we are aware of 50 people who were treated at hospital for ongoing treatment. Of those, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  11 remain in hospital for ongoing treatment. They are all in a stable condition and I am [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well. I want to take the opportunity to pay [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=167.88s)]

*  Superintendent Karen Jaundrill who will update on the investigation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  My thoughts are with all those injured in this awful incident, their families and friends [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=285.0s)]
*  and everyone who has been affected. Like us, many of you will still be coming to terms [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=289.96s)]
*  with what was a harrowing end to a day of celebration. I want to reassure the public [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=295.28s)]
*  of Merseyside that detectives are making significant progress as we seek to establish the full [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=300.96s)]
*  circumstances that led to this awful incident and bring the person responsible to justice. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  We have arrested a 53-year-old man from West Derby on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  driving offences and driving whilst unfit through drugs. He remains in custody where [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  he is being interviewed. We have a total of 65 confirmed casualties, many of whom required [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=325.08s)]
*  hospital treatment and our officers and family liaison officers are providing specialist [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=331.88s)]
*  support to a large number of these victims. Further work is ongoing to identify other [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=336.84s)]
*  people affected and we will continue to support these individuals in the days and weeks to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=342.68s)]
*  come. Due to the number of victims in this case, we have received assistance from our [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=348.84s)]
*  neighbouring forces for which we are extremely grateful. Our detectives are speaking to any [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=353.76s)]
*  witnesses, including those injured, witnesses at the scene and emergency responders as we [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=358.88s)]
*  seek to get a full picture of exactly what happened. In addition, extensive CCTV enquiries [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=364.0s)]
*  are being carried out across the city to establish the movements of the car, a Ford Galaxy, before [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=370.3s)]
*  the incident took place. We have already had an incredible response from many of those [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=376.56s)]
*  who were there last night. I thank them for their cooperation and support with our investigation [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=381.6s)]
*  and I would encourage anyone who has not yet contacted the police, who may have information [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=386.8s)]
*  on this incident, to do so. Thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  Well there, an update from Merseyside Police after the events in that parade and that detail [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=398.2s)]
*  we heard that the car which hit the crowds in Liverpool followed an ambulance after a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=414.32s)]
*  roadblock was temporarily lifted so paramedics could actually help a man who had suffered [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=421.56s)]
*  a suspected heart attack. So that detail, one of the many questions being asked was [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=426.76s)]
*  how, with the various road closures, the car was in that area, but that's the answer to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=434.0s)]
*  that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=441.92s)]
*  Regine is in Liverpool for us and, Regine, you were listening to that and that was interesting [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=442.92s)]
*  because as I was just saying just now, it is one of the many questions that has been [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  people how a car was in that area in the first place. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=453.72s)]
*  That's absolutely the heart of what everyone I've spoken to who was at that parade yesterday [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=459.88000000000005s)]
*  wants to try and understand. Now I think it's quite interesting, as you say, that we heard [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  from the police just then saying that they think that the car perhaps tailgated an ambulance [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  as it was driving through and the road was briefly opened because my BBC colleague Matt [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=475.52s)]
*  Cole was speaking to us a couple of hours ago here on the BBC News Channel now. He was [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=482.52s)]
*  up here with his family, his two young kids, a Liverpool fan, so he came up to see the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  parade and he sort of fits in with what he was saying because, Matthew, he talked about [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=493.0s)]
*  seeing an ambulance along this street when there were lots of people celebrating. He [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=497.56s)]
*  said that this water street behind me was absolutely packed with people who were celebrating [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=502.84s)]
*  but then he recalled seeing an ambulance and shortly after he saw that ambulance, he then [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=508.44s)]
*  saw that car and he came very close to the car. So, obviously, a very terrifying episode [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  for him to recount but that does kind of fit in to what we heard. I think the other thing [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=520.4399999999999s)]
*  that was quite striking from that news conference was a bit more detail about the person that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=525.28s)]
*  they have arrested. We know it is a 53-year-old man. Police say he is from West Derby and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=531.12s)]
*  among the charges that he has been held on, attempted murder and driving under the influence [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=537.96s)]
*  of drugs. Of course, as they were saying, this is still very much an active ongoing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=544.96s)]
*  investigation through the course of the day. We have seen forensic teams doing a lot of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=550.2s)]
*  work on the site behind me. I call it a site. It is a crime scene now, of course, but 24 [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=555.64s)]
*  hours ago, packed to the rafters with Liverpool fans at the height of the celebrations. Another [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=560.8s)]
*  thing, of course, worth picking up on from that news conference is an update on those [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=568.0s)]
*  who were injured. We heard from the NHS, they said they were aware that 50 people were treated [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=573.88s)]
*  and that 11 people remained in hospital for ongoing conditions. I think a glimmer of hope [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=580.88s)]
*  there really because we heard from the police there that all of those people seem to be [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=586.92s)]
*  recovering well. You only have to look at those images again to see what a lucky escape [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=591.68s)]
*  so many people had because it is terrifying to see those images of that car as it ploughed [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=597.12s)]
*  through the crowd on the street behind me. I'm just going to step out there. You can [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=602.28s)]
*  see more police officers who are leaving the scene there. We have seen lots of people [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=606.08s)]
*  come in and out. We have also seen them speak to witnesses as well. We heard in that statement [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=612.2s)]
*  there from police another appeal for more people to come forward. What we got in that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=618.32s)]
*  news conference, Matthew, was a bit more of a clue about what might have happened, but [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  there is so much speculation whirling around and we still really don't know why that car [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  drove through those clouds. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=632.56s)]
*  Thank you very much, after that update from Merseyside police. I will just repeat the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=635.04s)]
*  key lines coming from detectives there telling us first of all that the car that hit the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=641.4s)]
*  crowds there in Liverpool had followed an ambulance after a roadblock was temporarily [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=647.64s)]
*  lifted so paramedics could actually help a man who had suffered a suspected heart attack [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  and then the detail that Rajini picked up on rightly that the 53 year old man who is [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=657.92s)]
*  being held and questioned, he has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=663.04s)]
*  driving and driving while unfit through drugs. So those are the various areas that he is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=668.12s)]
*  being held on as the questioning continues and the investigation obviously continues. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  Finally an update in terms of those taken to hospital, 50 people initially taken to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  hospital, 11 remain there, all are in a stable condition but all appear to be recovering [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=686.72s)]
*  well. So those are the key planks coming out of that update from Merseyside police. We [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=693.72s)]
*  will keep an eye on that story, if there is anything more we will return to it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3lkHuj1pM&t=698.5200000000001s)]
