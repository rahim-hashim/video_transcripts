Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said he thinks talks to end the war in Gaza have been "going along very well", as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington DC.
 
Trump also expressed confidence that Hamas was willing to end the 21-month conflict. 
 
"They want to meet and they want to have that ceasefire," he told to reporters at the White House.
 
The meeting came after the latest rounds of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar ended without a breakthrough, though negotiations were expected to continue this week.

*  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for everything you do. Thank you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=64.26s)]
*  It's a great honor. Back in Israel there have also been signs of what the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=67.62s)]
*  Netanyahu government is planning to do after the war comes to an end. Israel's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=73.7s)]

*  crime against humanity. Speaking at the White House both Prime Minister [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=90.5s)]
*  Netanyahu and President Trump said they're working on a range of post-war [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  plans including looking at other countries that will take in Palestinians [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=97.66s)]
*  which under international law would amount to expulsion. I think President [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=101.42s)]
*  Trump had a brilliant vision it's called free choice. You know if people want to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=105.86s)]
*  stay they can stay but if they want to leave they should be able to leave. It [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=111.66s)]
*  shouldn't be a you know prison should be an open place and give people a free [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=115.82s)]
*  choice. We're working with the United States very closely about finding [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  countries that will seek to realize what they always say that they want to give [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=126.46s)]
*  the Palestinians a better future and those who and I think we're we're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=131.3s)]
*  getting close to finding several countries and I think this will do [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=137.66000000000003s)]
*  again the freedom to choose. Palestinians should have it and I hope [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=141.58s)]
*  that we can secure it close by. And we've had great cooperation from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=147.5s)]
*  surrounding meaning surrounding Israel surrounding countries great cooperation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=151.78s)]
*  from every single one of them so something good will happen. Our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=156.58s)]
*  correspondent in Jerusalem Myoni Wells told us about the reaction in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=161.46s)]
*  country to the proposals from Israel Katz. One thing to first stress is that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=164.62s)]
*  the Israeli government have not really ever given an official line on what [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=169.62s)]
*  their post-war plan for Gaza is. We've heard different iterations of ideas from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  different Israeli ministers. The latest that we've heard now is from the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=179.18s)]
*  Defense Minister Israel Katz. This plan to essentially move 600,000 people [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=183.1s)]
*  initially and then the full population of 2 million people to what he's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=189.18s)]
*  described as a camp on the ruins of Rafa in the south of Gaza. He's talked [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=193.38s)]
*  about screening people to get in to check that they aren't a mass operatives [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=198.66s)]
*  and to encourage then emigration otherwise people wouldn't be allowed out [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=203.38s)]
*  into other areas of Gaza. Now this has been strongly condemned by [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  international lawyers who say that this is essentially pushing people into a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=211.9s)]
*  confined space like this. Wider plans that the Israeli government has [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=218.38s)]
*  touted as well have been condemned as well by international lawyers as [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=222.3s)]
*  amounting to expulsion. Not least for example the plans which Donald Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  and Benjamin Netanyahu discussed which include this idea of trying to get [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  other countries to take in Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. Donald Trump said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=235.62s)]
*  that other countries in the region were cooperating. Benjamin Netanyahu said [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  that they were close to agreeing with other countries plans to take [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=243.82s)]
*  Palestinians in but contrary to this Arab states have actually been trying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=248.62s)]
*  to come up with alternative solutions because such a solution to expel people [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=253.54s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip would amount to expulsion under international law. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=258.82s)]
*  Naomi in the meantime discussions starting up again on a possible ceasefire. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=263.46s)]
*  How's that going? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=267.58s)]
*  Well the third round of official indirect talks in Doha have concluded [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=270.85999999999996s)]
*  with no real breakthrough so far. Obviously Donald Trump and Benjamin [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=275.38s)]
*  Netanyahu were keen to show positive momentum at this meeting to say that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=280.46s)]
*  talks were going well but we've not actually seen signs yet of a diplomatic [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=285.62s)]
*  breakthrough. Israeli media are reporting that there may be some [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=289.38s)]
*  progress on the issue of aid. Hamas want the UN to resume aid in Gaza and end [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  to the controversial US and Israeli backed Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=299.38s)]
*  although it's not clear whether either side may make concessions on this point. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=303.66s)]
*  But crucially one of the main sticking points still remains that Hamas wants [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  a US guarantee that hostilities won't continue after a ceasefire period. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  This has always actually been a deal on the table. If Israel commits to ending [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  the war Hamas has said it will release all the hostages. The problem is that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  Israel has so far rejected that as a solution as a ceasefire negotiation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=327.62s)]
*  It's not clear at all from a discussion so far between Donald Trump and Netanyahu [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=333.54s)]
*  at least not publicly that the US is keen to give such a guarantee. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=338.1s)]
*  So at the moment this remains the big sticking point here in negotiations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCBfQAbxljQ&t=342.66s)]
