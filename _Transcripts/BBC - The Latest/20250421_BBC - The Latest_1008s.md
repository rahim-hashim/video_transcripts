*  His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and his Church. He taught us to live the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=48.72s)]
*  values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially towards the poorest [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=54.64s)]
*  and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=61.599999999999994s)]

*  To the end, there for those who felt most connected with, greeting the masses on Easter Sunday, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=96.32s)]
*  his last public act. Always a Pope devoted to his work, finding it difficult to rest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=102.32s)]
*  even when told he had to. Recently meeting the King after his five-week stay in hospital [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=108.96s)]
*  and yesterday the US Vice President. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=114.96s)]
*  The surprise election in 2013 would mark a more radical break with the past than many expected. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=122.96s)]
*  Jorge Bergoglio did have Italian roots but was born in Argentina. While studying for priesthood, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=130.08s)]
*  he worked briefly as a nightclub bouncer. While many fellow Jesuits were jailed and tortured [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=136.96s)]
*  during Argentina's military dictatorship, he rose to become Archbishop of Buenos Aires. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=144.08s)]
*  Some accusing him of forging too close a relationship with the regime. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=150.4s)]
*  As Pope, he greeted his flock having taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  poor. Francis signalled that his pontificate would be rooted not in Rome but in the lives of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  believers around the world and especially those on the economic margins. His style was informal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  even when conducting ceremonies and his first act as Pope was to pay his own hotel bill. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=176.24s)]
*  His early gestures like washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=184.08s)]
*  he showed desire for his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  He spoke out for the protection of migrants and refugees laying a wreath on the waters where so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  many died on their perilous journeys. He traveled widely drawing energy from the crowds. In Brazil, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=200.24s)]
*  three million gathered on Copacabana beach. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=208.48s)]
*  And in the Philippines, he broke records for the world's largest mass as six million turned out [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  to join him. He linked economic inequality to the environment. In a video launching a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  papal encyclical, he said climate change amounted to rich countries inflicting damage on poor ones. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=227.28s)]
*  The Pope of the Holy See. In 2015, he became the first pope to address the US Congress. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=234.0s)]
*  I am most grateful for the invitation. Telling the world's richest nation to take care of mother [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=241.76s)]
*  earth. God bless America. He apologized for the scandal of sexual abuse of children by priests. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=248.72s)]
*  His words here spoken by a translator. God weeps for the sexual abuse of children. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=257.76s)]
*  On a visit to Ireland, the first by a pope in almost 40 years, he apologized to victims at [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=270.24s)]
*  almost every event, but scandals continued to emerge. His papacy marked something of a change [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=276.4s)]
*  of tone on the subject of homosexuality. Early on, remarking, who am I to judge when talking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=283.28s)]
*  about a gay bishop? But some progressives argue that in practical terms, the Vatican's stance [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  and the church's teachings have changed little. Even so, conservative Catholics viewed him with [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=296.88s)]
*  suspicion. But in some ways, he was as traditional as Pope John Paul II, whom he made a saint. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=303.11999999999995s)]
*  He had very conservative views on abortion, contraception, surrogacy and gender reassignment. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=310.24s)]
*  His style of papacy, though, couldn't have been more different to his immediate predecessor, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=317.44s)]
*  Benedict XVI, whose funeral he presided over. Through the scores of cardinals from the developing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=321.84s)]
*  world he appointed, he changed the complexion of the church hierarchy, consolidating a shift [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=329.84s)]
*  in the center of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe, where it was in decline, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=335.52s)]
*  toward Latin America, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=340.4s)]
*  In recent years, Pope Francis was beset by health issues, most noticeably affecting his mobility. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=346.32s)]
*  In February, he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia in both lungs, but was focused on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=352.4s)]
*  being able to return to participate in Easter celebrations, a goal he managed to fulfill, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  greeting the crowds in Rome. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=364.32s)]
*  He was, above all, a pastoral pope, a man of humility who preferred the fellowship of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=374.4s)]
*  ordinary believers to the trappings of ecclesiastical status and power. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=380.56s)]
*  Our religion editor there, Eileen MacBool, reflecting on the life of the late Pope Francis. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=385.6s)]
*  Pope Francis taking that name after Saint Assisi, who was a saint who lived his life as a beggar [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  because he believed in giving to the poor and he believed in the importance of humility. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=407.36s)]
*  Pope Francis taking that name on for himself when he became pontiff because humility was at [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=412.0s)]
*  the heart of his beliefs. Lots of statements coming in paying tribute. We've just heard from [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=417.92s)]
*  President Obama and Michelle Obama on the passing of Pope Francis. They say that he was the rare [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=424.96s)]
*  leader who made us want to be better people in his humility and his gestures at once simple and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=430.64s)]
*  profound, embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=437.2s)]
*  He shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  and one another. President Obama adds that today Michelle and I mourn with everyone around the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=450.32s)]
*  world, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, who drew strength and inspiration from the pope's example. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=455.76s)]
*  May we continue to heed his call to never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  So President Obama and Michelle Obama, they're just issuing their tributes to Pope Francis. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=468.0s)]
*  We can speak to Professor of Historical Theology at Villanova University, Massimo Fagioli, who joins [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=474.32s)]
*  us now. Professor Fagioli, of course we talk about the humility of the pontiff of late Pope Francis. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  He really did want to change the Catholic Church. We know that for many millennia the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=488.4s)]
*  Church was very, the processes were steeped in gold and in richery and finery. That's something [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=494.32s)]
*  that the pontiff did away with from the very moment that he took on this mantle as the head [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=500.88s)]
*  of the Catholic Church, not least by appearing in white robes rather than the traditional red. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=507.12s)]
*  That's true. He had the humility of a Franciscan, but he also had the courage [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=512.48s)]
*  of Jesuits and of a Latin American Jesuit. And so he was a complex mix of tradition on his views on [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  women in the Church, for example, and on innovation. But the most important thing was [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=530.08s)]
*  that he turned the Vatican towards the global world. The global South, the central event for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=536.0s)]
*  him in modern history was decolonization or colonialism. That was something that put him [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  at odds with many influential intellectuals, political leaders in the Western world. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  He has been a mix of disruption, of some consolidated ways of doing things in the Vatican [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=560.64s)]
*  and of reaffirming some of the traditional social views of the Catholic Church on the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=569.2s)]
*  responsibility of everyone towards everyone on the limits of private property, on the ills [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=578.64s)]
*  of capitalism. So he was a man of tensions held in polarity, as he used to say. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=586.4s)]
*  Tensions held in polarity, a fascinating phrase. Of course, tensions that arguably he tried to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=594.24s)]
*  make the Church more humble, make it more looking towards the poor. But obviously, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=603.52s)]
*  when he became Pontiff back in 2013, the Church was in a really difficult stage with the scandal [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=610.96s)]
*  over child sex abuse by priests and the institution's attempts to cover it up. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=618.72s)]
*  What's your assessment of how the Pontiff dealt with that? Because this was a really critical [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=624.64s)]
*  time, which was devastating for the Church, obviously devastating for the survivors as well. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  But did he handle it to the best of his abilities? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=636.64s)]
*  He handled it in ways that were typical of him in a particular way, because during Pope Francis' [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=641.84s)]
*  pontificate, what changed is that the abuse crisis in the Catholic Church became more global [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  in the sense that cases emerged in every continent, every country. It was no longer just [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  a crisis of sexual abuse by priests, but also by laypeople, by women, on other women. It has become [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=662.88s)]
*  a very comprehensive phenomenon in which the Church is now still trying to find a way. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=672.4s)]
*  Pope Francis called the first global meeting in the Vatican in 2019 where he asked the cardinals [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=680.32s)]
*  and bishops basically to listen to victims. That was the first time. So it was always limited. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=688.24s)]
*  This struggle in the Church is always a work in progress, but Pope Francis made really incredibly [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=696.4s)]
*  important steps forward. And in ways that need to be continued, it's far from over, of course. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=706.16s)]
*  Is there then an appetite for that in the Vatican to continue with that direction [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  that Pope Francis has brought about? Or is there a possibility that perhaps a more conservative [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  pontiff will be chosen going forward? Obviously, this is going to take a lot of time. We will have [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=728.88s)]
*  a conclave. But what do you think the direction of travel is and the desire is for the Catholic Church? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=734.96s)]
*  We will know fairly quickly in a few weeks, because the conclave will take place in a few weeks. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=742.72s)]
*  Now, the most important difference from the conclave of 2013 or of 2005 is that right now [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=751.92s)]
*  there's a sense of crisis not just within Catholicism, but also in the global Church. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=760.64s)]
*  This is the age of Donald Trump, and Pope Francis has been the most visible voice [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=766.32s)]
*  descending from a certain view of the human person, of politics, of immigration. So this is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=772.48s)]
*  the other factor that we did not have to the same extent in previous conclaves. We will see how the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=780.0s)]
*  internal agenda of Catholicism on women, on gays, on transparency will co-exist with the global [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=787.44s)]
*  situation. Also because this conclave will be made for the first time by the largest number [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=797.2s)]
*  of cardinals. The College has never been as big as it is today and never as international [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=805.6s)]
*  as it is today. So it will be a conclave in a very, very dangerous time for our world. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=813.92s)]
*  And the Church will be called to give its own answer to the situation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=820.88s)]
*  It's fascinating to think that we're talking about religion, obviously, but even behind the scenes, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=827.36s)]
*  the cardinals are grappling with, to your point, Professor, with the changing dynamic of the world. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=834.56s)]
*  And we know that Pope Francis, he really did have spats with the Trump administration over [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=842.24s)]
*  whether it be immigration, climate change, capitalism, even globalisation. He spoke out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=848.72s)]
*  We know for anybody who's seen the film Conclave of just how political the machinations are of [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  choosing a new pontiff. Where are the fractions then? Are there any riders coming through? And [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=859.6s)]
*  do they have to think about somebody who potentially, as we're seeing with political [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=866.64s)]
*  leaders, they either do everything to appease Donald Trump or speak out very vocally against [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=870.64s)]
*  him. What do you think is the balance that is happening amongst the cardinals now, the conversations [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=877.12s)]
*  behind those closed walls of the Vatican? Well, clearly this is a Church which is feeling the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=884.8s)]
*  impact of Donald Trump's policies on immigration, on trade in different ways. If it's Europe, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=892.0s)]
*  if it's Africa, if it's Asia. This is something we don't know how it will play out because we are [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=899.6s)]
*  in the middle of this second Trump administration and of other global disruptions. So it's clear [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=907.28s)]
*  that a more international College of Cardinals with many cardinals coming from Africa, Asia, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=916.16s)]
*  Latin America is more unpredictable. And all of them, I believe, will find some kind of consensus [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=922.72s)]
*  on what it means not to be able to count on America anymore in the sense of the defence of [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=931.92s)]
*  human rights and of human development. This is something that's affecting directly [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=940.4s)]
*  church operations in many countries. So it's going to be more complicated than the usual [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=946.16s)]
*  liberal conservative divide, which exists. But this time, I believe there will be a more existential [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=952.8s)]
*  sense of how Catholicism can hold to its values in terms of the promotion of human dignity of everyone, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=960.0s)]
*  not just Catholics, in the face of a new political wave that is about might make right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=970.48s)]
*  And so this is something very different from the conclaves that I have seen and I have studied [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=981.6s)]
*  in this last century. Fascinating to get that insight. Absolutely fascinating. Professor [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=988.88s)]
*  Fagioli, Professor of Theology at the Villanova University, thank you very much for your insight. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=994.08s)]
*  We will be watching very, very closely what happens with the conclave, of course. But for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  the time being, Professor, thank you so much. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg-QVd5wNbw&t=1005.36s)]
