Several countries are competing to lay claim to the region and the strategic sea lanes there.

*  Let's take you now to a tiny island at the centre of increasing tensions in the South [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=0.0s)]
*  China Sea, where several countries are competing to lay claim to the region and the strategic [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=3.88s)]
*  sea lanes there. Let's show you a map of what is the exclusive economic zones of each country, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=8.84s)]
*  as defined by the United Nations. But it's China which claims most of the South China [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Sea, as shown here. It's been building military bases and sending hundreds of ships to enforce [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=19.8s)]
*  its claims. Few countries have challenged it, but the Philippines has, and reinforcing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  the few reefs and islands it holds. The most important of these is the tiny island of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=29.56s)]
*  Pagasa, halfway between the Philippines and Vietnam. Our South East Asia correspondent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=34.28s)]
*  Jonathan Head was allowed a rare visit to the island. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=38.68s)]
*  We've been flying for an hour over an empty sea. Now we saw coral reefs, as we began [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=44.36s)]
*  looking for the speck of an island the Philippines calls Pagasa, or Hope. A flotilla of Chinese [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=50.66s)]
*  ships told us we were close. They're a permanent, intimidating presence. Less than a kilometre [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=57.28s)]
*  wide, Pagasa has barely enough runway for our plane to land. But the Philippines is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=66.12s)]
*  now building it up, with troops and new infrastructure. A small bastion of defiance against China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=73.92s)]
*  So here we are on Pagasa, and as you can see, there really isn't very much to it. In fact, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=81.92s)]
*  I think you could probably walk all the way around the island in about 30 minutes. But [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  it is solid land, a proper island, unlike the submerged reefs characteristic of this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=91.36s)]
*  area. And it does have a civilian population, all helping to reinforce the claims of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=96.64s)]
*  Philippines against those of its giant neighbour. But living here is tough and very isolated. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=102.08s)]
*  Around 300 people call this island home. There's a school and a clinic, but not much else. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=110.08s)]
*  Residents depend on government support like food rations. Those we spoke to all said they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=118.84s)]
*  liked the clean and quiet environment. The main challenge is when people, especially [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=123.88s)]
*  children, get sick. When it's a serious case, we need to evacuate them quickly to the mainland. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=130.96s)]
*  Planes are not always available, and sometimes the weather is too rough. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=137.72s)]
*  Aside from government jobs, fishing is the only viable way to make a living. But that's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=144.12s)]
*  become much more difficult since the swarms of Chinese ships arrived offshore, harassing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=149.48s)]
*  the little Filipino boats. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=154.84s)]
*  Those Chinese are not fishermen. Their ships are huge compared to our small wooden boats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=157.04s)]
*  They threaten us, coming close and salting their horns to chase us away. Because of that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=163.56s)]
*  we can only fish close to the island, and the fish stalks here are much smaller. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=168.88s)]
*  If it's to prevent a complete Chinese takeover in this area, the Philippines needs to hold [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=176.12s)]
*  on to this sliver of land. Its forces are outnumbered and outgunned. But after years [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  of watching China expand its presence in these seas, there is a renewed determination in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=189.48s)]
*  the Philippines not to retreat any further. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan Head, BBC News, on Pagasa Island. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCsJBRH_TU&t=198.95999999999998s)]
