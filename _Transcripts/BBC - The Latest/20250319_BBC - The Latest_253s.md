# Trump and Putin ‘trust each other', says Kremlin | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA)
*  Judging by some of the headlines in Russia today, Moscow believes the latest telephone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=0.0s)]
*  conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin went well, certainly for the Kremlin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=4.96s)]
*  The Russian leader is yet to be pressured into any major concessions and is stalling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=10.84s)]
*  on the unconditional 30-day ceasefire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=14.76s)]
*  In the last hour, Vladimir Zelensky spoke with President Trump to get an update on those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=17.68s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=21.92s)]
*  It is unlikely he will be reassured by the tone coming from the White House nor the commitments [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=23.28s)]
*  given by the Russian president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=29.0s)]
*  The Kremlin said it would observe a mutual moratorium on the targeting of energy infrastructure [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=31.4s)]
*  and within an hour of giving that commitment, this happened. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=36.76s)]
*  The Russians launched 150 drones overnight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  This was a hospital in the Sumy region that was hit, among other transport and civilian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=49.04s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=54.0s)]
*  There were 150 drones overnight, targeting energy infrastructure, among other things. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=55.84s)]
*  There were strikes against transport. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=64.0s)]
*  Two hospitals were unfortunately hit. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=66.24s)]
*  In other words, Putin's words are very much at odds with reality. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=68.78s)]
*  Not only did Moscow not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, President Putin set further red [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=76.0s)]
*  lines for peace. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=82.2s)]
*  The Ukraine-Ukraine conflict could have a negative impact on Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=83.4s)]
*  It could include an end to western military aid to Kiev and intelligence sharing as well [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=87.4s)]
*  as an end to the mobilisation in Ukraine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=92.4s)]
*  Naturally, that would lead to Ukraine's capitulation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=95.4s)]
*  A short time ago, the US National Security Adviser Mike Walsh was asked whether military [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=98.4s)]
*  aid to Ukraine had cropped up in that conversation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  It did not, he said. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=106.2s)]
*  Well, let's get some reaction and speak to our State Department correspondent, Tom Bateman. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  All we know is that it was due to start at 10am local time, so that's an hour ago. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  And then we await more from the White House. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  I think the important thing to say is, as far as we know, this is the first direct contact [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  between President Trump and Zelensky since he was unceremoniously ejected from the White [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  House, having been told he was ungrateful and disrespectful by Mr Trump and Vice President [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=133.6s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  And we then saw military and intelligence assistance to the Ukrainians cut off in a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  move to apply intense pressure to them to sign up to President Trump's proposal for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  a full and immediate ceasefire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  That was then reinstated, of course, when the Ukrainians agreed to that plan by President [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump, which was for that ceasefire, which would take effect across the front line, a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  truce at ground, sea and air. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  And of course, what we then saw in the space of a week last night with the call between [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=167.0s)]
*  President Trump and Putin was Mr Trump effectively retreat significantly on that position. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=172.0s)]
*  So you now have the proposal for a much more limited truce, as you've been saying on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=179.0s)]
*  And it's not clear, actually. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=184.0s)]
*  The Americans have talked about this in both terms, whether it's just energy infrastructure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=186.0s)]
*  or energy and infrastructure. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=190.0s)]
*  There's been confusion between the two readouts from the White House and the Kremlin on this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=193.2s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=198.2s)]
*  So we're trying to understand what exactly the ceasefire proposal is supposed to encompass. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=199.2s)]
*  But what you have seen now, of course, is this is now the new proposal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=204.2s)]
*  And the next stage in this should be talks between the Americans and the Russians, potentially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=208.2s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=214.2s)]
*  But there's still some confusion about whether that is a technical level discussion about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=216.2s)]
*  how to implement this new truce proposal, the more limited one, or whether it's going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  to involve the principals, as they're called. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  So the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz and Mr Witkoff as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  Still a lack of clarity on that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  But it looks like the Americans are trying to push things forward in terms of discussions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  with the Russians. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  Just seeing a line here from the White House that that call is continuing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  So it was due to start, I think, about half an hour ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  It continues. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  We'll bring you news when we get some idea of the readout from that call. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=245.6s)]
*  Tom, for the moment, thank you very much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=251.6s)]
*  Let's bring in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikXyryJjonA&t=252.6s)]
