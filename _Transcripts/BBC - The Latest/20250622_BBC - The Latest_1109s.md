Video Description: Nuclear sites in Iran have been severely damaged after a huge operation involving 125 warplanes and "deception tactics", a top US general has said. 
 
Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow.
 
Speaking at a briefing by the Pentagon, Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen Dan Caine said it will take some time to fully assess the extent of the damage Iran sustained but initial assessments indicated "all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction."
General Caine said US forces remain on "high alert" and are "fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation".
In response to the attacks, Iran warned of "everlasting consequences" and accused President Trump of "betrayal".

# Iran's nuclear sites 'severely damaged' after operation of 125 warplanes - top US general | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs)
*  We've just been watching their press conference by the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=0.0s)]
*  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Cain, where they've been talking [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=7.76s)]
*  about what the US is calling Operation Midnight Hammer. That was that operation which dropped [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=12.96s)]
*  bombs on three nuclear sites in Iran. We heard Secretary Hegseth describe the operation as [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  focused, powerful and clean. He said it had devastated the Iranian nuclear programme. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=27.4s)]
*  We don't obviously have any independent verification of that at this point, but that is how the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=34.44s)]
*  US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth is describing it. He said it had taken months and weeks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=39.4s)]
*  of planning, positioning and pre-positioning. And he said that it was the first deployment [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=44.76s)]
*  of these massive ordnance penetrators, the so-called bunker busters that we've been [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=51.68s)]
*  talking about all week. And he said it had been done closely arranged with the allies [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=56.88s)]
*  in Israel. We then heard from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Cain, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=63.72s)]
*  who said that this had been carried out with exceptional skill and discipline and had severely [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=69.2s)]
*  degraded Iranian weapons and infrastructure. He said the whole operation had begun at 5pm [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=74.02s)]
*  Eastern time yesterday, about 10pm here in the UK, and it began with the US submarine [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=82.02s)]
*  launching about two dozen Tamahawk missiles. He then described aircraft that had flown [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=87.34s)]
*  ahead of these big B-2 aircraft to run a deception mission, essentially to confuse the Iranian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=93.22s)]
*  defence systems. But he also said that not a single shot had been fired and that he thought [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=101.84s)]
*  that the US strike package, as he called it, had got in and out of Iran without being detected [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=106.86s)]
*  and that they had used 125 aircraft, 75 precision guided missiles and 14 of these massive ordnance [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=113.86s)]
*  penetrators that we have been talking about. And we'll discuss the actual logistics of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=124.98s)]
*  that operation with our security expert, Mikey Kay, in just a moment. But for now, let's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=132.58s)]
*  go back over to Washington DC to our Chief North America correspondent, Gary O'Donoghue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=137.38s)]
*  Gary, a lot of praise there from the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the members [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=142.3s)]
*  of the military who carried it out and for the President himself. They're clearly very [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=147.18s)]
*  happy with how this operation went. They are, and they've sort of flooded the zone there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=151.42s)]
*  with quite a lot of facts, which of course everyone will pour over and make of what they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  will. The one thing I will draw out of that was that they did say twice that the battle [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  damage assessment is ongoing, and that is something that is what you would expect, and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=170.56s)]
*  there is a little bit of odds with the President saying that there is total and complete obliteration [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=179.56s)]
*  of these facilities. How do you know at this point when you're still assessing it? They [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=185.16s)]
*  repeated that kind of rhetoric, but at the moment you'll notice that while we had a nice [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=191.28s)]
*  map of the bombers leaving the US and their direction and all that, there was no imagery, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=196.04s)]
*  no evidence, if you like, of these assertions. So I think that the jury is very much still [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  out on their claims about the nature of what's been achieved here. That may come in the coming [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  days, it may not, but at the moment it's just assertion. And I think while that was happening, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  we're also seeing some comments from the Vice President, JD Vance, who's been talking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=223.32s)]
*  to other networks, warning Iran, suggesting that this was now an opportunity, suggesting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=228.76s)]
*  that their programme had been put back by years, but also just suggesting that it had [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=235.36s)]
*  been completely destroyed. And so the messaging has begun on this, and that will carry on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  through the day with the Donald Trump's senior lieutenants about out on all the talk shows [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=247.0s)]
*  in the coming hours. Gary, for a President who has run three campaigns at this stage [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=252.24s)]
*  on being the President to take America out of wars, being the peacemaker, the dealmaker [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=258.12s)]
*  and so on, the detail that we heard there from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=262.88s)]
*  in particular, this sounds like it was quite a sizeable operation involving submarines, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=267.68s)]
*  various different types of aircraft, many personnel involved as well, quite the opposite [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=273.36s)]
*  of what the President said he was going to do. Yeah, there's a lot of hardware here, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  including some decoys by the sound of it that flew west instead of east, 125 aircraft, I [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  think you mentioned 75 position-guided bombs, all this kind of thing. It's, I think if you're [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=291.28s)]
*  going to get involved, then the way you would want to message this is look how powerful we are, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=296.88s)]
*  look what we can deliver, overwhelming force, not a shot fired in response to us. That is a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  message that may resonate with the American people who may be wondering where those promises went [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=311.44s)]
*  about ending forever wars and staying out of foreign conflict. So if you're going to do it, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=318.64s)]
*  you probably want to do it and make a show of it like they've done tonight and really in a sense [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=326.24s)]
*  flaunt your power and that was very much what we just saw there. And they were also asked Gary, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=332.88s)]
*  weren't they, about when they had notified the Congressional leadership, which is the kind of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=337.84s)]
*  par for the course procedure here that you would alert those people in Congress who [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=343.76s)]
*  ordinarily have to pass permission perhaps for something like this. Yeah, I'll be honest with you, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=348.32s)]
*  I missed that bit while I was doing something else, so I don't know what was said about that, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  but you're right, there is normally a process. My handwritten notes here Gary, yeah, so my handwritten [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=359.52s)]
*  notes here as I was scribbling frantically, there was a lot going on. Secretary Hegg said, I think, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=363.84s)]
*  said we notified the Congressional leadership in the immediate aftermath of the operation once [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=369.2s)]
*  gotcha, once all of the American pilots were out of Iranian airspace. That sounds quite late to me [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=376.0s)]
*  in terms of what's typically done. They have this gang of eight group of Congressional leaders [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=384.4s)]
*  in house and senate who they typically keep in the loop on this sort of thing. And certainly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=389.44s)]
*  some Democrats have been complaining about not being kept in the loop on this kind of thing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=394.48s)]
*  But bear in mind there have been some efforts in Congress to try and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=399.28s)]
*  force the administration to get authorization, but Donald Trump's not interested in that. He, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=404.0s)]
*  like many American presidents in recent years, has taken more executive power to himself. He will [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=409.84s)]
*  say there's no declaration of war here, so there's no constitutional right for Congress to intervene [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=415.84s)]
*  on that. This is a, you know, they're hoping a one and done situation, although he clearly left the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=421.52s)]
*  door open last night for more attacks, which he said, he said there were still plenty of targets [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=427.76s)]
*  left. And it would be a lot easier, he said next time, if Iran didn't choose peace over tragedy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=432.32s)]
*  All right. Gary O'Donoghue there in Washington. Thank you very much for that. Well, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=438.8s)]
*  let's try and translate some of that military speak now into a language that mere civilians [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=443.84s)]
*  can understand. I'm joined by the security briefs, Mikey Kay, former senior officer and assault [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=448.56s)]
*  helicopter pilot with the British military. Mikey, there was a lot of terminology there, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=453.12s)]
*  a lot of descriptions of various branches of the military. We didn't actually see any video [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=458.16s)]
*  of what might have happened, which is slightly unusual, I suppose, in this day and age. But [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  what's your take on the operation as it was described there? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think all the posturing that we saw last week, the mass exodus of what's called KC-135, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=471.68s)]
*  big air refueling tankers. There was about 21 of those that pressed east from the US, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=478.8s)]
*  along with fighter packages from F-35, which is a fifth generation stealth fighter, to F-22, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=486.08s)]
*  which is probably one of the most advanced air defence fighters in the world. Only the US has [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=493.2s)]
*  got that. To F-15. So all of these strike aircraft have the ability to do what the joint chiefs of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=497.68s)]
*  staff said was in military parlance, it's called SIAD. And that stands for suppression of enemy [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=504.88s)]
*  air defences. So we're all focusing on the B-2s at the moment. So we saw that mass exodus, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=512.24s)]
*  the tankers, the fighter jets, the B-2s, and this is obviously what they were posturing for. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=517.84s)]
*  Kerry Kane mentioned as well, didn't he, the Tamahawks fired from the submarine in advance, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  and those aircraft flying ahead of the B-2 to kind of, as a distraction, I suppose. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=530.32s)]
*  Yeah, Pete Heksef used the word misinformation. The military word is deception decoy. And we saw [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=536.64s)]
*  the joint chiefs of staff using that terminology as well. And yeah, so it's a multi-layered package, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=544.88s)]
*  a composite air package, Kamao is what we call it in the military. You'll have the core of that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=551.68s)]
*  being the B-2s with the GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrators. And yeah, you can just see it's a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=557.28s)]
*  phenomenally long journey. The B-2s will have been picked up at various stages of that. So [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=564.32s)]
*  as they're coming out of the States, they're going to be using KC-135 tankers to refuel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  As they're then coming over into Europe and into the region, that's when you'll get these [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=575.84s)]
*  additional suppression of enemy air defence fighter packages joining them, going ahead. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=581.2s)]
*  And what they'll be using is one of the key assets that those fighter packages will have is called [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  an anti-radiation missile. So what the fighter packages will be looking for is the surface-to-air [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=591.6s)]
*  missile operators in Iran territory. As soon as they switch on that surface-to-air missile radar, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=599.12s)]
*  there's generally two, there's a search radar and a target tracking radar. But as soon as they're [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=605.84s)]
*  turned on, these aircraft have the ability to look at that radio frequency, understand what it is [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=610.16s)]
*  through algorithms in the software, and then be able to, if it remains on, be able to pinpoint [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=617.2s)]
*  that surface-to-air missile system with the anti-radiation missile, get that off the rail, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  and then take out any threat to the B-2s coming in. So that's the general idea of it. And then [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=627.76s)]
*  you've got the T-Lams, which are, it looks like from the map we can see on the screen there, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=631.6s)]
*  based off the Omani coast, they've got a range of over 2000 kilometres. They fly very low. They fly [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=636.96s)]
*  at about three quarters of the speed of sound. They've got an accuracy up to about 10 metres, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=642.24s)]
*  GPS guided with a thousand pound warhead. So if you then flood more of Iranian airspace with that, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=647.04s)]
*  that's going to be also form part of a decoy package as well. They're used not like the GBU-57, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=654.96s)]
*  the big ones, they're used to what's called soften up targets, if you like, and just basically [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=660.08s)]
*  provide a scatter effect. Iran's air defences have been degraded and some instances destroyed [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=664.8s)]
*  quite significantly. So they're going to have problems with dealing this sort of scatter effect. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=673.68s)]
*  And that was the whole intent of the package. And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff there, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=678.88s)]
*  General Dan Kane, said twice, again, looking at my handwritten notes here, that they are unaware of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=682.64s)]
*  any shots having been fired. And he said, particularly on the way out, no shots were [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  fired by the Iranians. Does that strike you as unusual that all of this would be happening in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=694.24s)]
*  Iran and they wouldn't be trying to fire at what had caused it? Well, I think it goes back to the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=699.2s)]
*  conversation we had a little bit earlier, which was about Trump tweeting about air superiority. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  Air superiority is a doctrinal word used in military parlance to suggest some form of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=710.96s)]
*  superiority over another country's airspace. So you're minimising any attritive effect to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=717.44s)]
*  air operations that you want to conduct, in this case over Iran, for example. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=724.08s)]
*  So I think the whole strategy from last week was not just by the IDF. I think the US were definitely [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  speaking and working with the IDF because the IDF were targeting the surface-to-air missile [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  systems where you did see that bomb damage assessment video, ballistic missile sites. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  Battle damage assessment here hasn't been completed yet. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=744.88s)]
*  And it won't be. I mean, you know, the secretary, Pete Hegseth, used the word destroy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=747.5999999999999s)]
*  Devastated. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=754.56s)]
*  Yeah. Trump used the word obliterated. Joint Chief, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=755.52s)]
*  Stan Kane, was more nuanced and more realistic by saying severely degraded. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=758.64s)]
*  You can't say you've destroyed something unless you've got an accurate bomb damage assessment [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  of A, what you were targeting, and B, what's left of that. The way that it usually works is, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  as I spoke about earlier, is you have what's called this lightning pod. And it's effectively [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=774.0s)]
*  a big tube that's strapped under an aircraft that has electro-optics and infrared that's used to be [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=780.24s)]
*  able to target, track and surveil and record and then do surveillance on what the bomb damage [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=786.56s)]
*  assessments are. And so when targets are usually attacked, these pods are used to look at what the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=792.72s)]
*  bomb damage assessment. Basically, they will film the bomb or the missile going in and then they'll [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=798.64s)]
*  look at the after effects of that. But in this case, I think it was very different. A, the B2 [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=803.12s)]
*  doesn't have that capability. I think this will have been a huge standoff deep strike. I don't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=807.68s)]
*  know what the ranges of a GBU-57, but it will be that. And we're seeing, because there isn't this [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=815.36s)]
*  video footage, because these pods seemingly haven't captured any BDA bomb damage assessment, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=821.68s)]
*  it's going to be much harder to figure out what happened. And then we're talking about [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=827.04s)]
*  facilities underground. I mean, you know, you physically have to have someone in there to look [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=830.08s)]
*  at what the damage has been done. And then we don't know what was in there. The Iranians are saying [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=834.88s)]
*  they've moved a lot of the enriched uranium already. So what was actually there in the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  first place? Has it just decanted to something else? What are the metrics of effect and the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=843.36s)]
*  metrics of effect in this case are going to be really hard to gauge? We'll maybe learn some more [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=847.12s)]
*  later. But for now, Mikey Kaye, thanks so much for joining us with all of that information. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, as we've been hearing there, three key sites were hit. That's been described to us just there [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So let's have a closer look at them. As they've been [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=862.48s)]
*  outlining, those sites were at Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan. President Trump said the sites had been [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  obliterated. And as we've just been discussing there, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=873.5200000000001s)]
*  described them as severely degraded. Esfahan is a uranium conversion plant, whilst Natanz is a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=878.96s)]
*  enrichment plant. And even before these US strikes, the International Atomic Energy Agency [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=886.64s)]
*  said that Natanz had already sustained severe damage. But the main site hit was Fordow. The [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=892.24s)]
*  uranium enrichment site there is situated about 60 miles, 100 kilometres or so south of the capital [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=898.48s)]
*  Tehran. And it's in a mountainous region. It's thought to consist of two main tunnels that has [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=905.92s)]
*  centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, as well as a network of smaller tunnels. Now, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=912.0s)]
*  reaching this underground installation, which is about 60 metres below ground, as we've been [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=918.64s)]
*  discussing, requires these more powerful bunker busting bombs, which only the US has. And as we [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=923.76s)]
*  heard there from that press conference, 14 of them were used in this operation last night. The [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=931.12s)]
*  official name is the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator. And the only planes that can carry [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=937.6s)]
*  such bombs are B-2 stealth bombers. And as we've heard there, these are the ones that were used [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=943.52s)]
*  last night. 125 US aircraft involved in this mission, multiple B-2s were told. And as I say, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=952.4s)]
*  14 of those massive ordnance penetrators. Well, let's have a listen to some of what the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=963.12s)]
*  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi had to say about these US strikes when he gave a news [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  conference in Istanbul a little earlier. The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns in the strongest [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  terms the United States' brutal military aggression against Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  It is an outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation of the fundamental principles of the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=991.2s)]
*  Charter of the United Nations and international law. The warmongering and lawless administration [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=998.24s)]
*  in Washington is solely and fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1006.08s)]
*  implications of its act of aggression. The US military attack on the territorial integrity [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1015.52s)]
*  and national sovereignty of a UN member state carried out with genocidal Israeli regime, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1025.28s)]
*  carried out in collision with the genocidal Israeli regime, has once again revealed the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1034.32s)]
*  extent of the United States' hostility towards the peace-seeking people of Iran, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1041.52s)]
*  who will never compromise over their independence and sovereignty. The Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1048.24s)]
*  continues to defend Iran's territory, sovereignty, security and people by all means necessary [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1055.12s)]
*  against not just US military aggression but also the reckless and unlawful actions of the Israeli [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1064.48s)]
*  regime. While President Trump was elected on a platform of putting an end to America's costly [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1071.76s)]
*  involvement of forever wars in our part of the world, he has betrayed not only Iran by abusing [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1080.16s)]
*  our commitment to diplomacy but also deceived his own voters by submitting to the wishes [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1090.16s)]
*  of a wanted war criminal who has grown accustomed to exploiting the lives and wealth [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1096.72s)]
*  of American citizens to further the Israeli regime's objectives. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgMXRDR-xs&t=1104.24s)]
