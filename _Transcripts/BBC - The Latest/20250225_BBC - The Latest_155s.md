Video Description: Police in the UK will be given new powers to search homes without a warrant for stolen mobile phones under major legislation which targets theft, street crime and anti-social behaviour.
 
The Crime and Policing Bill is at the heart of what the government has called its "Safer Streets mission" and ministers want it to become law by the end of the year.
 
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC the bill would address an "epidemic of street theft", including a rise in phone and bag snatching and shoplifting, and introduce new "Respect Orders" with restrictions similar to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos).
