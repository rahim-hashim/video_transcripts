**BBC - The Latest:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4)
*  A cable car has plunged to the ground in southern Italy, killing at least four people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=0.0s)]
*  The accident happened at Monte Fatto, a thousand metre high mountain about 30 kilometres south-east [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=6.16s)]
*  of Naples. Some reports suggest that one of the cables snapped. 16 people had to be rescued [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=11.96s)]
*  from another cabin which was stuck in mid-air. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  My correspondent Rich Preston is here to tell us more. Not many details that we know but [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=22.72s)]
*  what do we know for sure about this tragedy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=28.08s)]
*  Yes, that's right, details are a bit scammed. What we do know is that this happened at about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=31.36s)]
*  4.30pm local time. Now, this cable car starts in the town of Castel Maia di Stabia, which [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=37.08s)]
*  is, as you mentioned, 30 kilometres south-east of Naples. It takes people up to the top of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=47.72s)]
*  Monte Fatto. It's a journey that costs about 10 euros. It takes about 10 minutes and it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=54.72s)]
*  climbs about a thousand metres in altitude to the top of the mountain. Beautiful views [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=60.36s)]
*  over the Gulf of Naples on your journey. Very popular tourist destination and this is indeed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=66.2s)]
*  a very popular tourist attraction which only recently reopened for the summer season, just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=72.0s)]
*  a week ago. And as I say, at about 4.30pm local reports say that one of the cables snapped [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=77.16s)]
*  sending one of the cars on this cable car dropping from a height of about 28 metres [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  to the ground. The latest details are that four people have been killed. One person is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=90.4s)]
*  extremely seriously injured. The public transport company that operates the cable car has described [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=96.92s)]
*  it as a tragic accident. Now, as I mentioned, this only recently reopened this cable car [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=104.0s)]
*  and it's been closed for an extended period and during that period will have undergone [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=110.8s)]
*  regular maintenance and safety checks and cable cars are not uncommon around the world [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=115.12s)]
*  and they have built into them various back-up systems including emergency braking systems [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  which are designed to kick in even in the event of a cable failing so that the company [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  describing this as a tragic accident. It's not entirely clear yet what happened. But [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=131.22s)]
*  of course those questions are being asked. What more do we know about what an investigation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=137.44s)]
*  might be looking at? Well, once everyone's been cleared from the area and a rescue operation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=143.12s)]
*  is still underway, 16 people we know have been rescued from this other car which stopped [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=151.56s)]
*  mid-air further down the rails, we know that one of the things hampering rescue efforts [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=156.84s)]
*  has been bad weather, in particular rain and fog and in fact even in the last week since [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=162.4s)]
*  it's been opened the cable car operation has been suspended several times because of that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  weather but mountain rescue operations in Italy are pretty slick, they're pretty well [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=170.88s)]
*  organised. I've been mountaineering in Italy so once everyone is clear from the scene, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=175.16s)]
*  officials will investigate exactly how this cable snapped if that is indeed what happened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=180.68s)]
*  and as I mentioned why a braking system didn't kick in. You often have a spring-loaded braking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=186.4s)]
*  system in the event of losing tension in the main cable, it will automatically, it [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=191.92s)]
*  doesn't need any power, it will automatically grip on to a back-up cable so how it was able [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=197.72s)]
*  to fall frankly from the sky, these 28 metres, killing as we know at the moment at least [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=203.0s)]
*  four people is yet to be determined. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFq2LRdRs4&t=210.32s)]
