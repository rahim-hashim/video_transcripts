Video Description: The 2026 Commonwealth Games are in doubt as the Australian state of Victoria has cancelled its plans to host the sporting event.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said Victoria had been "happy to help out" when approached to host last year, but after projected costs tripled to more than A$6 billion for the 12-day event, it became “well and truly too much" for the state to bear. 

The government said it will still complete the stadium upgrades it promised, while using the money it is now saving on housing and tourism initiatives – while the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) said it is "committed to finding a solution" for the multi-sport tournament.

# Commonwealth Games in doubt as Victoria pulls out of 2026 hosting – BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y)
*  Now let's go to Australia next, where the state of Victoria has pulled out of hosting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  the 2026 Commonwealth Games, saying the cost of staging the event had become too great. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=5.8s)]
*  Victoria volunteered last May to host the Games, but the state's Premier says the projected [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  cost was now three times larger than they were anticipating and had become too much [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=17.32s)]
*  to bear. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=22.52s)]
*  I've made a lot of difficult calls, a lot of very difficult decisions in this job. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=23.52s)]
*  This is not one of them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=28.04s)]
*  Frankly, six to seven billion dollars for a 12-day sporting event, we are not doing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=29.56s)]
*  that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=34.4s)]
*  That does not represent value for money, that is all cost and no benefit. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=35.4s)]
*  The Games will not proceed in Victoria in 2026. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=39.24s)]
*  We have informed Commonwealth Games authorities of our decision to seek to terminate the contract [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=45.16s)]
*  and to not host the Games. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's go live to Melbourne now to speak to our correspondent there, Shima Khalil. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=55.4s)]
*  The opposition in the state of Victoria are saying this is a huge humiliation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=60.52s)]
*  Tell us more. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=65.52s)]
*  Well a shock, a surprise, disappointment, all of these have been used as reactions to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=68.52s)]
*  what has been announced today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=75.4s)]
*  It was a shock to the Commonwealth Games Federation themselves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=77.4s)]
*  They said they were given eight hours notice before that decision was made. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=80.44s)]
*  As you said, Victoria volunteered to host this, the Commonwealth Games in 2016. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=84.76s)]
*  It was touted as a boost to the regional economy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=91.0s)]
*  Different regions were going to host these Games and it was going to be a support for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=94.56s)]
*  the infrastructure, to create jobs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=100.4s)]
*  But Daniel Andrews today said it was going to be all cost and no benefit, at least that's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=103.64s)]
*  the local government's or the state government's assessment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  This was budgeted for 1.5 billion pounds, so about two billion dollars and it has increased [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=112.2s)]
*  three times that much. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=117.52s)]
*  Essentially the state government said they could not fund it anymore. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=119.52s)]
*  But that was the surprise of the Commonwealth Games Federation who said that up until that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=125.12s)]
*  announcement was made the government of Victoria said they could still cover it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=129.96s)]
*  Of course it was a shock to Commonwealth Games Australia who said the shock from this was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=135.72s)]
*  beyond embarrassing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=141.64s)]
*  Remember we're in Melbourne, we're in Victoria. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  This is the heart of sporting here in Australia. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=145.72s)]
*  This is the home to the first Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  And remember the timing of this could not be more problematic. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  We were here actually to cover or to do some coverage before the Women's World Cup, this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  other huge sporting event that Australia is meant to host. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Two days before that Victoria comes out with this announcement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  There are many, many questions about this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=171.0s)]
*  Why did they leave it to the last minute to say that they didn't have the money and why [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=173.56s)]
*  did they choose now when all eyes are on Australia for the Women's World Cup to announce something [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=177.12s)]
*  like this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  Now the Commonwealth Games Federation is saying we are committed to finding a solution but [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=185.16s)]
*  one wonders what that might be because Victoria was probably the only one that volunteered [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=189.12s)]
*  to host these games. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=194.28s)]
*  That's right and I think the solution is to find someone else, to find another place, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  to find another location, another state here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Sydney has been touted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=204.96s)]
*  Western Australia has also been mentioned as a potential host but remember this is very, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=206.52s)]
*  very late in the game. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=213.52s)]
*  We're talking three years before that to start the infrastructure and to restart the whole [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=214.52s)]
*  process. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=220.84s)]
*  And again in the middle of Sydney getting ready to host the Women's World Cup. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  So it really is not clear who's going to take this on, how much it's going to cost and I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=228.36s)]
*  think also just the reputational damage and the embarrassment for Australia, the fact [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=234.76s)]
*  that now all eyes are on Australia for the wrong reasons. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=239.44s)]
*  I think this is also something that they want to consider. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=243.16s)]
*  The costs of course are going to be an issue and whichever state chooses to do this will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=246.92s)]
*  have to convince its people, its local government that this is going to, you know, the cost [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  for benefit are going to be parallel and they're going to even out and that is going to be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=258.12s)]
*  a big task. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=262.84s)]
*  Okay Shyamma, thank you so much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=263.84s)]
*  Shyamma Khalil in Melbourne Forest. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3Syt2XZ7Y&t=265.44s)]
