Video Description: Local officials say nine people have been killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in north-eastern Ukraine.

The Sumy regional military administration said four other people were injured in the town of Bilopillia on Saturday morning as the bus travelled to the regional capital Sumy, close to Russia's border. 

The reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 - no breakthrough was achieved, although a swap of prisoners of war was agreed. 

Ukraine's national police described the bus attack as a "cynical war crime". Russia has not commented directly but said it had hit a "military staging area" in Sumy.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA)
*  Hello, I'm Emma Vardy. Let's start this hour with some breaking news. Nine people have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=0.0s)]
*  been killed in a Russian drone strike on a passenger bus in northeastern Ukraine, according [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  to local officials. The Sumi Regional Administration says another four people were injured in the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=9.84s)]
*  town of Bilapea on Saturday morning. The reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=15.4s)]
*  held their first direct peace talks since 2022. Let's speak now to our Ukraine correspondent [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=21.44s)]
*  James Waterhouse, who's in Kyiv. James, what more do we know about this strike? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=28.12s)]
*  Well the police in the Sumi region have posted some pretty disturbing images of a mangled [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  minibus where there is blood on the floor along the side of a road and they say that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=41.88s)]
*  it was packed full of passengers making its way from the border towards the northeastern [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=46.64s)]
*  city of Sumi itself. They say it was struck by a Russian drone. These piloted, these [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=51.4s)]
*  remote controlled drones that are frequently aimed at civilians right across border towns [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=59.28s)]
*  and settlements or even on the front line. I mean Sumi's had a pretty tough time of it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=64.64s)]
*  over the past couple of months when it comes to missile and drone attacks from attacking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=70.28s)]
*  Russian forces. What Moscow is claiming on this occasion is that it struck a weapons [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=75.28s)]
*  loading area, a preparation area used by Ukrainian forces but we've yet to see any evidence [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  accompany that claim. So a very difficult morning in Ukraine's northeast today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=87.76s)]
*  And this coming off the back so soon after those peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=95.4s)]
*  what effect might this have on that process? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=100.68s)]
*  I think we're talking about a process whilst diplomatically significant. Yes it is true [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  that it's the first time in more than three years that Ukrainian and Russian officials [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=109.84s)]
*  stared each other in the eye and tried to negotiate some kind of end to the fighting. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  There were areas of agreement when it came to a large prisoner exchange, a thousand by [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  each side. There are preparations taking place we understand already for that to happen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=124.7s)]
*  But when it comes to a ceasefire itself, I don't think we are any closer. The Russian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=130.24s)]
*  delegation in Turkey has been accused again of demanding the complete control of four [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=136.04s)]
*  Ukrainian provinces. That would equate to the handing over of swathes of territory and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  major cities that Russia has been unable to take in all the years of fighting so far and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=146.56s)]
*  Ukraine simply won't go for it. Now Volodymyr Zelensky's had his European allies put an [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=152.32s)]
*  arm around him once more. The likes of Donald Tusk of Poland, Emmanuel Macron of France [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=157.44s)]
*  and Sikhiya Stammer of the UK. They are now saying they still hope that Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=162.36s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin of Russia could still meet. Moscow says it has noted that request. But [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=167.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been accused of merely buying time, trying to take part in these peace talks [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=176.12s)]
*  to stall further sanctions, economic punishments which are being prepared by Ukraine's European [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  allies as well this week as these attempted peace talks really do for Ukraine drag on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=187.32s)]
*  What do you think it would take, the steps that would be needed to get to direct peace [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=194.32s)]
*  talks between Zelensky and Putin? I think it would take a catalyst in the shape of Donald [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=198.2s)]
*  Trump. At the moment we know he is impatient and it is the military might of America which [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=206.0s)]
*  determines the course and direction of this war. For Ukraine that is an inescapable fact. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=212.92s)]
*  But I think you have what we have seen so far is President Trump pressure Ukraine more [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=220.04s)]
*  than he has pressured Russia. Ukraine has had to demonstrate to show that it is fully [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=225.48s)]
*  willing to engage in some kind of peace process. That is why you saw Volodymyr Zelensky in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=230.2s)]
*  Turkey this week. He did cut an isolated figure in the absence of Donald Trump and Vladimir [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  Putin. But that is what Ukraine is trying to do. But I think for both Ukraine and Russia [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  to engage in meaty, meaningful discussions I think there will have to be some kind of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=244.92s)]
*  pressure you would imagine applied on the Kremlin by America. What could that be? Could [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=249.92s)]
*  that be more military aid for Ukraine? Could that be further sanctions which the US President [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=255.0s)]
*  hinted at in the past? Ukraine certainly hopes so. I think what Ukraine does not have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=260.0s)]
*  is any kind of military pressure to apply to Russia. That window has gone. Russia is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=265.92s)]
*  firmly keeping hold of the territory it has brutally seized and it is continuing to take [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=270.28s)]
*  more notably on the vast eastern front lines of this country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dUDjbvxpMA&t=275.24s)]
