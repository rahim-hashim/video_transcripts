Video Description: US President Donald Trump said he wants Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza, which he described as a “demolition site”.
 
In a phone call this weekend, President Trump said he had told Jordan's King Abdullah: "I'd love you to take on more, because I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess."
 
Most of Gaza's two million residents have been displaced in the 15 months of war, which has flattened much of Gaza's infrastructure.
 
Hamas has vowed to oppose any such action, and the comments will likely outrage Palestinians in Gaza.
 
Some on Israel’s far-right want to return to Gaza, and have welcomed President Trump’s comments.

# President Trump calls on Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc)
*  And we start this out in the Middle East with comments by President Trump on Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=0.0s)]
*  He has proposed removing a million and a half of its Palestinian residents [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=5.12s)]
*  and asking Jordan and Egypt to take them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=9.84s)]
*  He told journalists the strip was literally a demolition site and suggested it be cleaned out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=12.88s)]
*  Israeli bombardments have reduced much of Gaza to rubble. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=19.68s)]
*  Mr Trump's comments will be seen as unacceptable by Palestinians who see [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=23.52s)]
*  Gaza as their homeland and by Arab countries which reject the forced displacement of people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=27.92s)]
*  Hamas says it will oppose plans to relocate Palestinians, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=33.92s)]
*  whilst Islamic Jihad said the plans would encourage Israel to commit war crimes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=37.36s)]
*  But Mr Trump's comments are already being welcomed by far-right politicians in Israel, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=42.64s)]
*  some of whom want to restore Jewish settlements there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=47.92s)]
*  Let's take a listen to what President Trump told reporters on Air Force One. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=51.2s)]
*  I'm looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it's a mess. It's a real mess. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=56.08s)]
*  You'd like Jordan to house people from Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  To take people. I'd like Egypt to take people. I'm meeting with, I'm talking to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  General El Sisi tomorrow sometime I believe. And I'd like Egypt to take people and I'd like Jordan [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=70.4s)]
*  to take people. I mean you're talking about probably a million and a half people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=77.36s)]
*  And we just clean out that whole thing. It's, you know, it's over the centuries that's had [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=83.12s)]
*  many, many conflicts at site. And I don't know, something has to happen. But [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=88.72s)]
*  it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished and people are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=96.0s)]
*  dying there. So I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=108.48s)]
*  Temporarily or would they be able to go back? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=113.68s)]
*  Could be temporary, could be long term. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=115.92s)]
*  President Trump's comments come as thousands of displaced Palestinians are being prevented [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  from returning to their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip after Israel accused Hamas of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=125.84s)]
*  breaching the terms of their ceasefire deal. These are live pictures from Gaza where people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=130.88s)]
*  are waiting to return to their homes. There were some chaotic scenes on Saturday evening [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=136.4s)]
*  as Palestinians who had expected to be able to walk north following the completion of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  hostage release found that the road was still blocked by Israeli tanks. Israel has so far [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=146.72s)]
*  prevented them crossing into the north until plans are in place for the release of Israeli [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=152.16s)]
*  civilian Abel Yehud who is being held by the Islamic Jihad. The dispute came after Hamas [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  freed four Israeli women soldiers on Saturday. They had been taken hostage from a military base [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=164.32s)]
*  on the Gaza border in the 7th of October 2023 attack and 100, 200 Palestinian inmates were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=170.64s)]
*  released from Israeli prisons, the second exchange to take place as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=178.64s)]
*  Well our correspondent Nick Beek is in Jerusalem and has more on President Trump's comments and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=185.92s)]
*  reaction to them. From the Israeli perspective the right wing here has already said that this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=191.28s)]
*  is fantastic news. You've got prominent right-wing politicians saying that this is exactly what they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=198.08s)]
*  want to be hearing from America. We know that there are far-right extremists here who say that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=203.84s)]
*  Gaza should be their homeland and they'd like to see Jewish settlers move there. In terms of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=210.4s)]
*  reaction from Palestinians, if you put yourself in the position of those families, we saw pictures [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=216.4s)]
*  just a moment ago of people waiting to move from the south where they've been displaced back to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  the north to try and find out what remains of their homes. I think there's a few ways of looking at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=227.76s)]
*  this. Clearly their immediate priority is getting back home but when they hear that sort of language [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=233.36s)]
*  from President Trump saying that Gaza is a wasteland, it's in ruins, it's over, clear the whole [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=237.76s)]
*  place out, that would be concerning. And also we've seen in the choice of the next American [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=243.44s)]
*  ambassador to Israel, this is someone, Mike Huckabee, who previously has rejected the idea [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=250.24s)]
*  of a Palestinian state among other things. On the other hand, President Trump says he wants peace in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=256.0s)]
*  the Middle East, he wants to strike bargains around the world, do deals and included in that would be, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=262.08s)]
*  you'd imagine, a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Arab countries around [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  here, there's no way they would countenance the expulsion, the moving out of Palestinians. So [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=273.28s)]
*  two ways of looking at these comments that President Trump has made today. Off the fly it would seem he [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  didn't really give a huge amount of policy detail and when he was asked whether this was a temporary [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=284.32s)]
*  solution or a long-term thing, he said either could work. Yeah, I'm just seeing reports that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=288.96s)]
*  a mass official has vowed to quote oppose President Trump's idea of relocating [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Gazans. President talked about how he was going to talk to Jordan and Egypt, how are they likely to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  react to what he has suggested in those comments on Air Force One? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  Well I think like everyone they'll be trying to assess them and put them in the context of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=313.2s)]
*  decades of American foreign policy which has said that ultimately there should be a Palestinian [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=317.76s)]
*  state. The Biden administration were clear about that and you had President Biden and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=323.2s)]
*  Antony Blinken, his Secretary of State and others talking about reconstructing Gaza for Gazans. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=327.76s)]
*  Clearly this is a huge operation but the Arab states were looking towards that so we'll have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=335.2s)]
*  to see what reaction comes in from the likes of Jordan and Egypt during the day but clearly this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  is diametrically opposed to the direction they want to head in in terms of beginning this task [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=346.88s)]
*  of rebuilding Gaza. Of course that's weeks, months off because we're just a week into this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=352.24s)]
*  very fragile ceasefire. Yeah and on that thousands of Palestinians as we've said are trying to get [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=357.36s)]
*  back into northern Gaza but again Prime Minister Netanyahu's office saying Hamas have breached the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=362.88s)]
*  ceasefire deal. Why are they saying that Hamas have breached the deal? So this all boils down to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=368.56s)]
*  fate of one particular civilian hostage Abel Yehud. She is 29 years old. It was widely expected and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=377.92s)]
*  reported in the Israeli media over the past week that she would be released yesterday but on Friday [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=385.6s)]
*  night when Hamas gave the list of the four women to be released she wasn't on it and in fact they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=390.32s)]
*  were four soldiers. So Israel says that Hamas has basically undermined the deal which says in essence [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  that civilians should be released before soldiers. So what's happened is Israel says that as a result [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=402.4s)]
*  they are stopping all those Palestinian families in the south of Gaza moving to the north. They [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=409.68s)]
*  were getting ready to to make that move with all the possessions they still have. So what's happened [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=414.88s)]
*  now is that Hamas have said well actually she'll be released next weekend and Hamas and Islamic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  Jihad another militant group have apparently provided proof of life for this civilian and so [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=426.72s)]
*  it would seem now we're waiting for the Israelis to say whether or not this satisfies them and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  they will give the green light to that huge number of people being able to move from the south of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Gaza further to the north. Nick Big in Jerusalem or staying in the Middle East the Lebanese health [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  ministry has accused the Israeli army of firing at residents trying to return to their homes in [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=450.16s)]
*  southern Lebanon killing at least three and injuring 44. Israel's military has missed a [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=455.12s)]
*  deadline to leave the area as a 60-day ceasefire deal expired. It has not said how long its forces [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=460.56s)]
*  will stay in Lebanon. Both Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters were supposed to have completed [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=467.92s)]
*  their respective withdrawals. Israel says Lebanese troops have not deployed fast enough [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=473.36s)]
*  while the Lebanese military blames Israeli procrastination. Lebanon's new president called [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=478.56s)]
*  restraint our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachege is in Beirut and outlined what the deal was. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=485.2s)]
*  This deal stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the south of the country and also [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=492.32s)]
*  the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from the south and at the same time thousands of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=498.08s)]
*  Lebanese soldiers would be deployed to that part of the country. Now what the Israelis are saying [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  is that this deal hasn't been fully implemented that the Lebanese military hasn't really fully [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=509.92s)]
*  deployed to the south and in response the Lebanese are saying that there have been delays in this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=517.44s)]
*  deployment because of what they described as Israel's procrastination in pulling out from [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=524.64s)]
*  the country but I think at the heart of what's happening here is what the Israelis have been [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=530.48s)]
*  saying and that is that they need more time to destroy to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=535.52s)]
*  the south of the country. They're still concerned about the Lebanese military's ability or even [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  willingness to really act against Hezbollah in the south. This is a part of Lebanon where for [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=549.6s)]
*  decades Hezbollah has been the dominant force. Now we don't know how many Israeli troops remain [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=555.36s)]
*  here in Lebanon. We don't know how long they might stay in the country and we don't know how [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=561.76s)]
*  Hezbollah is going to respond. I don't think anyone is expecting the conflict to resume but [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=568.72s)]
*  I think any kind of violent reaction from Hezbollah is likely to face opposition not only from its [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=574.88s)]
*  critics here in Lebanon but also from some of its own supporters in the country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN88SZZBnDc&t=581.6s)]
