# Israeli military says it has 'full aerial control over Tehran' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU)
*  We start in the Middle East where strikes between Israel and Iran are now on their fourth day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel says it has full aerial operational control over Tehran after Iran hit Israeli cities with a wave of missiles overnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=5.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Anna Foster is in Jerusalem covering all of the latest developments for us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=13.0s)]
*  Let me bring you right up to date with the latest on the conflict between Israel and Iran [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=19.0s)]
*  and hostilities here in the Middle East which continue to increase as four days now have passed since those attacks that Israel launched on Iran in the very early hours of Friday morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=24.0s)]
*  Now Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, has warned that the residents of Tehran would, as he put it, pay the price for Iranian attacks on his country's citizens. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=35.0s)]
*  But he has since qualified that statement that he put on social media. He said that there was no intention to physically harm the city's residents. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=43.0s)]
*  Now Israel says the number of people who have been killed by Iranian missiles has risen to 24 since Friday with eight of those deaths coming overnight from Sunday into Monday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=52.0s)]
*  There were missile attacks against Haifa and Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=61.0s)]
*  Now Iran's health ministry says that more than 220 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since Friday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=65.0s)]
*  It's called on European nations to stop what it describes as an Israeli aggression. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=72.0s)]
*  And the Israeli military says that it killed four senior Iranian intelligence officials with a targeted airstrike and says it now has full aerial operational control over the Iranian capital Tehran. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=77.0s)]
*  So it is a fast moving conflict as you know, things developing and changing all of the time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=89.0s)]
*  We've also been seeing pictures from Tehran of people desperately trying to leave that city. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=94.0s)]
*  Long queues of cars, traffic jams as people try to leave. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=99.0s)]
*  Of course, as these Israeli attacks continue, people are trying to protect themselves and their families. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=104.0s)]
*  And they feel that the best way to do it is to try and get out of the Iranian capital Tehran at the moment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=109.0s)]
*  Now Israel has been also experiencing, seeing and hearing and feeling these barrages of Iranian missiles that have been coming towards Haifa, towards Tel Aviv as well. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=115.0s)]
*  I just want to show you these pictures filmed by our BBC cameraman, Robbie Wright. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=128.0s)]
*  This is what it looked like early this morning in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=133.0s)]
*  You can see in here that the sound and the sight of those Iranian missiles being intercepted in the sky high above Israel by its air defence systems. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=136.0s)]
*  But some of those missiles do get through and our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bishageh is at one of those sites that was hit in one of those barrages of Iranian missiles. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=162.0s)]
*  Hugo, what is happening where you are? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=173.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here in the city of Petah Tikva. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=176.0s)]
*  This is one of the cities where an Iranian missile hit a building. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=181.0s)]
*  So let me just show you because behind me we can see this 20-storey building that was hit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=187.0s)]
*  You can see this huge hole in the building. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=193.0s)]
*  This is the point of impact of this missile. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=196.0s)]
*  And this attack happened at around four o'clock in the morning and at least four people were killed here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=199.0s)]
*  And two of the victims had been inside bomb shelters at the time of the attack. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=205.0s)]
*  And the missile struck a wall between the shelters and the walls of the shelter didn't collapse as a result of this direct impact here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=211.0s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of work here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=222.0s)]
*  All morning residents have been coming to the buildings. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=224.0s)]
*  This is a residential complex with four buildings. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=227.0s)]
*  All of them have been damaged. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=231.0s)]
*  They've been coming here, visiting their flats, if possible, collecting some some objects. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=233.0s)]
*  They don't know when they're going to be able to return to their homes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=239.0s)]
*  But there is a lot of work to repair the damage already happening. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=242.0s)]
*  And I think the feeling that I got from talking to people here and also yesterday in a different city that had been attacked is that people are in shock with the scenes that they're seeing here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=248.0s)]
*  And I think there's also the feeling that they felt they were protected by the country's air defense systems. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=259.0s)]
*  Obviously, Israel has a very sophisticated layer of protection. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=268.0s)]
*  And now they're saying that this system is not perfect. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=272.0s)]
*  I mean, I think this strategy here, the Iranian strategy is to fire dozens, if not hundreds of missiles and drones at the same time, trying to overwhelm the country's air defense system. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=276.0s)]
*  So it's almost inevitable that some missiles are going to penetrate this layer of defense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=287.0s)]
*  And the authorities have been telling the population here in Israel that this is a robust, strong system, but it is not perfect. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=293.0s)]
*  So they've been telling the public to follow the instructions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=300.0s)]
*  There's a state of emergency here to seek shelter when these attacks happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=304.0s)]
*  And the indications from the Israeli authorities are that these attacks against Iran are going to continue. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=309.0s)]
*  Perhaps this is a prolonged campaign, not days, but weeks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=316.0s)]
*  And they expect attacks like this to continue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=320.0s)]
*  Hugo Bachega in Petartikva, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=328.0s)]
*  BBC Verify has been looking at what satellite imagery can tell us about the damage that's been inflicted by Israel on Iran's military infrastructure and nuclear facilities. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=331.0s)]
*  Let's hear more from BBC Verify's Melan Thomas. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=342.0s)]
*  As Iran and Israel continue launching strikes, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=345.0s)]
*  satellite imagery can give us an insight into what's happening on the ground. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=348.0s)]
*  And it's particularly useful when looking at Iran, where it's incredibly difficult for BBC journalists to operate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=352.0s)]
*  Now, let's take a closer look. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=358.0s)]
*  We've been examining satellite images of Israeli strikes on military infrastructure and nuclear facilities across Iran. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=359.0s)]
*  These are some of the areas in Iran that we've been analyzing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=366.0s)]
*  Now, this is an image from the 15th of June of a missile base in Bidkana, which has been hit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=369.0s)]
*  And you can see really clear damage from space in the roof of this building. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=374.0s)]
*  And elsewhere, we can see several areas of damage at the International Airport in Tabriz, which is near a reported military base. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=379.0s)]
*  Now, we've compared images taken on the 13th and the 14th of June. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=386.0s)]
*  You can see this blackened area in the center of the main runway here. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=390.0s)]
*  And you can see signs of damage to a taxiway at one end, two points here where it meets the main runway. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=394.0s)]
*  And have a look at this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=400.0s)]
*  This is an atance. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=402.0s)]
*  That's a nuclear site where you can see damage here in an image on the 14th of June. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=403.0s)]
*  Now, according to analysis from the Institute for Space and International Security, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=408.0s)]
*  this electrical substation here was damaged alongside the pilot fuel enrichment plant as well. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=412.0s)]
*  Now, at BBC Verify, we're still examining more satellite imagery from elsewhere in the country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=418.0s)]
*  And we're speaking to experts who can help us understand more about what type of damage we're seeing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=423.0s)]
*  And they can tell us what type of targets have been hit too. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=428.0s)]
*  Well, the head of the nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has been talking about damage to Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=434.0s)]
*  Now, he says there has been no further damage since Israel's attack was launched on Friday. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=442.0s)]
*  Rafael Grossi has been addressing what has been called as an extraordinary session [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=448.0s)]
*  of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors to discuss those strikes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=452.0s)]
*  He said there had been no more damage at the Natanz site in central Iran. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=457.0s)]
*  There has been no indication of a physical attack on the underground cascade hole [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=463.0s)]
*  containing part of the pilot fuel enrichment plant and the main fuel enrichment plant. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=469.0s)]
*  However, the loss of power to the cascade hole may have damaged the centrifuges located there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=477.0s)]
*  The level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=488.0s)]
*  indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=498.0s)]
*  Well, Mr. Grossi also said that there was no change to radioactivity levels at the Isfasan nuclear site, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=508.0s)]
*  another key site in Iran. It was also damaged on Friday. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=517.0s)]
*  But he did have this warning about the ongoing conflict. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=521.0s)]
*  Military escalation threatens lives, increases the chance of a radiological release [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=524.0s)]
*  with serious consequences for people and the environment, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=528.0s)]
*  and delays in dispensable weapons. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=532.0s)]
*  Consistent with the objective of the IEA and its statute, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=535.0s)]
*  I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=540.0s)]
*  Well, that was a very interesting presentation. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=550.0s)]
*  I think we have a lot of time left. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=553.0s)]

*  Giyagol, our BBC Persian correspondent, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=766.0s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=768.0s)]
*  for your insight as this conflict [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=770.0s)]
*  continues to escalate. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=772.0s)]
*  There really is no sign [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=774.0s)]
*  that those continuing waves [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=776.0s)]
*  of retaliatory strikes [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=778.0s)]
*  that we're seeing between the two sides, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=780.0s)]
*  and there's another one here in Israel, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=782.0s)]
*  barrage of Iranian missiles that arrived [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=784.0s)]
*  at about 4 o'clock this morning. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=786.0s)]
*  And again, those pictures that we're seeing from Iran [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=788.0s)]
*  with Israel saying that some of its most [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=790.0s)]
*  senior intelligence leaders have been killed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=792.0s)]
*  in the last 24 hours, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=794.0s)]
*  and the biggest oil refinery in the country [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=796.0s)]
*  has also been set alight [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=798.0s)]
*  by Iranian attacks. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=800.0s)]
*  So it is very fast-moving, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=802.0s)]
*  it's a very complex story, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=804.0s)]
*  even for the diplomats to follow. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=806.0s)]
*  But that is the question, really, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=808.0s)]
*  what might be next for this conflict, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=810.0s)]
*  and if anybody has the ability, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=812.0s)]
*  I suppose, to control what [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=814.0s)]
*  Israel and Iran decide to do next. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=816.0s)]
*  Well, joining me now is Vali Nasser, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=818.0s)]
*  a professor of international affairs [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=820.0s)]
*  and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=822.0s)]
*  University School of Advanced [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=824.0s)]
*  International Studies. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=826.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=828.0s)]
*  What is your assessment of what [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=830.0s)]
*  you're seeing so far, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=832.0s)]
*  and whether there is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=834.0s)]
*  anything that could be happening [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=836.0s)]
*  in the next 24-48 hours, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=838.0s)]
*  short-term, that could bring this to a halt? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=840.0s)]
*  Because at the moment, people are saying [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=842.0s)]
*  that this could last for weeks or even longer. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=844.0s)]
*  I do not see [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=846.0s)]
*  a stop to this conflict [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=848.0s)]
*  in the short-term, because [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=850.0s)]
*  this is now a full-fledged war. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=852.0s)]
*  Israel has [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=854.0s)]
*  started this war with the aim [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=856.0s)]
*  of destroying Iran's [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=858.0s)]
*  nuclear program, and it's not [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=860.0s)]
*  close to having achieved that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=862.0s)]
*  And it wanted also [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=864.0s)]
*  to downgrade and destabilize [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=866.0s)]
*  the Iranian state. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=868.0s)]
*  It has assassinated a number of leaders. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=870.0s)]
*  It has hit a lot of targets. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=872.0s)]
*  But it hasn't achieved that either. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=874.0s)]
*  And if in the face of Iranian missiles, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=876.0s)]
*  Israel was to stop now, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=878.0s)]
*  it would look like it has failed [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=880.0s)]
*  in its mission. Similarly, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=882.0s)]
*  Iran does not want [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=884.0s)]
*  to be seen that it has caved [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=886.0s)]
*  to Israeli military attack, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=888.0s)]
*  and it wants to push [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=890.0s)]
*  Israel to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=892.0s)]
*  recalibrate and recalculate [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=894.0s)]
*  the cost that it's incurring [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=896.0s)]
*  by waging this war. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=898.0s)]
*  I think the two sides are going [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=900.0s)]
*  to bloody one another for a while longer [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=902.0s)]
*  before there might be an opening [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=904.0s)]
*  for any kind of a ceasefire conversation. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=906.0s)]
*  Who has influence [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=912.0s)]
*  on what is happening right now? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=914.0s)]
*  So, for example, in the last 24 hours [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=916.0s)]
*  or so, we heard that [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=918.0s)]
*  Israel had plans [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=920.0s)]
*  to assassinate [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=922.0s)]
*  the supreme leader of Iran, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=924.0s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=926.0s)]
*  But the US President Donald Trump [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=928.0s)]
*  had paid to that and said that he would not support it, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=930.0s)]
*  and that's why it didn't happen. Equally, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=932.0s)]
*  a suggestion that Russia's Vladimir Putin [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=934.0s)]
*  might start to become some sort [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=936.0s)]
*  of peacemaker, which would be a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=938.0s)]
*  departure for him to get involved [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=940.0s)]
*  and arrange some sort of ceasefire. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=942.0s)]
*  Who is really in control here of what's [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=944.0s)]
*  going on? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=946.0s)]
*  The only country that literally [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=948.0s)]
*  can actually bring about some [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=950.0s)]
*  form of ceasefire or mediate [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=952.0s)]
*  is the United States, because the United States [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=954.0s)]
*  alone has influence with Israel, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=956.0s)]
*  the kind of influence that can [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=958.0s)]
*  change Israel's position, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=960.0s)]
*  and also the United States has [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=962.0s)]
*  the kind of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=964.0s)]
*  leverage with Iran in form of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=966.0s)]
*  nuclear negotiations, sanctions, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=968.0s)]
*  relief that would be of interest [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=970.0s)]
*  to the Iranians. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=972.0s)]
*  President Trump could use President Putin [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=974.0s)]
*  as a go-between, but [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=976.0s)]
*  President Putin cannot do that on [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=978.0s)]
*  his own. I think that President [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=980.0s)]
*  Trump saying that he vetoed [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=982.0s)]
*  the killing of Iran's supreme [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=984.0s)]
*  leader may or may not be true. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=986.0s)]
*  But the reason that he's saying it is [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=988.0s)]
*  to provide political space for [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=990.0s)]
*  the Iranian leadership to accept [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=992.0s)]
*  a US mediating role. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=994.0s)]
*  So he's trying to play good cop [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=996.0s)]
*  in order to be able to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=998.0s)]
*  have some kind of an influence on the outcome. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1000.0s)]
*  Bally Nasser, thank you for [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1002.0s)]
*  joining us, for sharing your analysis [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1004.0s)]
*  with us. Really appreciate it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1006.0s)]
*  And that is really key right now, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1008.0s)]
*  is who actually has the power [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1010.0s)]
*  to try and affect what's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1012.0s)]
*  happening here in the Middle East. And certainly all eyes [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1014.0s)]
*  are on the US, particularly as the US President [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1016.0s)]
*  Donald Trump over the weekend has really [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1018.0s)]
*  oscillated between several different positions [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1020.0s)]
*  at times, seeming to support [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1022.0s)]
*  what was happening, and that was after the US Secretary [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1024.0s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio put out a statement [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1026.0s)]
*  very early on, dissenting the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1028.0s)]
*  US from what was happening. There were real concerns [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1030.0s)]
*  for both US, UK, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1032.0s)]
*  French and other assets here [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1034.0s)]
*  in the region. So I think, Lucy, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1036.0s)]
*  one thing that we're going to be talking about a lot more [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1038.0s)]
*  in these next few days, and which I know you're about to talk [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1040.0s)]
*  more about now, is diplomacy. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1042.0s)]
*  When world leaders are getting together, the conversations [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1044.0s)]
*  that they are having, they will really [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1046.0s)]
*  be trying to work out how they can perhaps [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1048.0s)]
*  navigate a path through this [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1050.0s)]
*  between two sides, neither of whom [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1052.0s)]
*  at the moment, wants to back down. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1054.0s)]
*  Anna Foster there with the very latest [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1056.0s)]
*  for us from Jerusalem. We do have lots of live pictures [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1058.0s)]
*  coming to us from Israel. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1060.0s)]
*  You can see here the site [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1062.0s)]
*  of one of the Iranian [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1064.0s)]
*  strikes in Benai-Brak. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1066.0s)]
*  A crowd of people there just gathered [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1068.0s)]
*  around. We also have the skyline [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1070.0s)]
*  for you of Tel Aviv as well. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1072.0s)]
*  Israel now saying at least [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1074.0s)]
*  eight people had been killed in the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1076.0s)]
*  third night of bombardment [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1078.0s)]
*  of Israeli cities. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1080.0s)]
*  That brings the total to 24. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1082.0s)]
*  Nearly 300 people are being killed [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1084.0s)]
*  in the city of Tel Aviv. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1086.0s)]
*  The Israeli military now says [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1088.0s)]
*  it's destroyed one third [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1090.0s)]
*  of Iran's surface to surface [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1092.0s)]
*  launches. Tehran [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1094.0s)]
*  is accusing Israel of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1096.0s)]
*  targeting a hospital in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1098.0s)]
*  Western Iran, condemning [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1100.0s)]
*  it now as a war [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1102.0s)]
*  crime as well. And just to tell you [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1104.0s)]
*  Iranian authorities [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1106.0s)]
*  are saying the number [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1108.0s)]
*  of people killed there [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1110.0s)]
*  since Friday is [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRwnjuYumU&t=1112.0s)]
