Video Description: In the south of Denmark, a mega project is under construction in the form of a giant tunnel under the Baltic Sea, linking the country to Germany. 
 
The Fehmarnbelt link is currently Europe's largest construction site and the world's longest prefabricated road and rail tunnel.
 
Costing more than €7 billion ($7.5 billion), mostly financed by Denmark, it’s part of a wider EU plan to improve travel links in northern and southern Europe.

# How the world’s largest underwater tunnel is being built | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM)
*  In the south of Denmark, a mega project is underway to build a tunnel under the Baltic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=0.0s)]
*  linking the country to Germany. It's currently Europe's biggest construction site and the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=7.04s)]

*  to northern and southern Europe. Adrian Murray paid a visit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=22.36s)]
*  It's on a scale that's hard to take in. The size of 600 football pitches, this colossal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=28.04s)]
*  construction site is where a record-breaking tunnel is being built, linking Denmark to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=34.68s)]
*  Germany. Inside three enormous halls, tunnel segments, each more than 200 metres long, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=40.44s)]
*  are being moulded from steel and concrete. Running 18 kilometres under the Baltic Sea, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=48.32s)]
*  the Femmenbelt will be the world's longest prefabricated tunnel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=55.04s)]
*  It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Everybody's the winner because obviously businesses, they will be closer connected and then by [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  not having an extra distance to drive, you'll also cut in carbon because travelling 160 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=67.32s)]
*  kilometres less. It will slash the rail journey between Copenhagen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=74.0s)]
*  and Hamburg from four and a half to just two and a half hours and replace the 45 minute [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=77.92s)]
*  ferry sailing by a drive of less than 10 minutes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=84.1s)]
*  Financed mostly by Denmark, this seven and a half billion dollar mega project has been [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=88.92s)]
*  in the pipeline for almost two decades. After repeated delays from lawsuits and environmental [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=94.12s)]
*  opposition, it's hoped the project will boost the local area and building is now well underway. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=100.48s)]
*  As much steel as 50 Eiffel towers will be needed. Assembling this metal structure is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=108.44s)]
*  the first step of building the tunnel. It will be moulded with concrete and nine of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  them will be put together to make a single element. In all, 90 segments like these will [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=119.84s)]
*  be linked together, piece by piece, like Lego bricks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=126.08s)]
*  Now we are in the first part of the tunnel. We are in just one side of the future motorway. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=131.08s)]
*  Here we have the water and as you can hear, it's quite thick. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=137.04s)]
*  Behind these huge steel doors is sea water and the next section of tunnel will have to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=142.56s)]
*  be placed here exactly. To do that is a feat of engineering. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=148.0s)]
*  A trench has been dug into the seabed and one by one each segment weighing 73,000 tonnes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=153.44s)]
*  will be floated out then lowered into position with 15 millimetre precision. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  We have to be very, very careful that it's placed just in front of the next one. So we [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  have a system called pin and catch. We will have some arms grabbing onto the element, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=172.88s)]
*  dragging it slowly into place and we can remove the steel doors behind us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=177.32s)]
*  The bedrock is too soft to drill under, but a tunnel was deemed more secure than a bridge. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=181.72s)]
*  If you have a bridge going north south, the wind is kind of perpendicular. There was also [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=188.2s)]
*  the risk or should we say probability of ships crashing into bridges. You actually have rather [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=193.0s)]
*  deep water, 30 metres, which means the biggest ships can sail there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  Soon the crucial next segment will be moved into place and when it opens five years from now, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=204.6s)]
*  Scandinavia will be a little closer to mainland Europe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM&t=211.16s)]
