Trump told the BBC that tariffs on EU goods imported into the US could happen "pretty soon".
 
On trade with Britain, he said "The UK is out of line. But I'm sure that one, I think that one, can be worked out."

# EU facing potential tariffs from the US | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo)
*  In Europe and here in the UK, businesses are grappling with how to react to a new, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=0.0s)]
*  seen as more hostile, trade environment. Well, this week President Trump described [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=4.72s)]
*  America's trade relationship with the UK as quote, out of line. He said the European Union was quote, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  way out of line. Now a British government spokesman has said the UK-US trade relationship is fair and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=16.0s)]
*  balanced. So let's talk to Chris Southworth, who's the Secretary General of the International [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce here in the United Kingdom. Chris, good to have you here. And you know, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=25.92s)]
*  is that a fair assessment? How would you describe the trade relationship right now between the UK [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=29.76s)]
*  and the US? The UK-US relationship is excellent. It's very, very sophisticated. We're both big [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=33.68s)]
*  service economies, big financial tech and trade economies. And there's a terrific amount of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=40.24s)]
*  flow of trade, whether it's financial or services or goods between the UK and the US. And we're both [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  very pro sort of open trade in the global system. So there's no reason that the two of us should [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=52.72s)]
*  get into a tariff war. I think what we've really got to do and big opportunity here is to appeal to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=58.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's business acumen and focus on the big opportunity, of which there are a number, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=64.4s)]
*  and big opportunities up for grabs in improving trade overall for everybody. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=71.6s)]
*  Yeah. So the whole global system, but also for US businesses. We'll talk about those opportunities [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=77.2s)]
*  in just a sec. But is there a potential here that the UK, you know, gets caught up in all of this, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=82.88s)]
*  that big spat we know is going on between the US and China, also with its northern neighbour, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=87.2s)]
*  Canada, also with Mexico, its biggest trading partners, the European Union, of course. The UK [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=92.0s)]
*  could just be collateral damage here, couldn't it? There's always a risk. I don't think that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=97.12s)]
*  likely to happen. The relationship with the US is very good. The relationship with the EU is very [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=102.16s)]
*  good and improving. But we're independent of US and EU. So we play quite an important [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=107.36s)]
*  and interesting role between the two big trade blocks. And I think the government and the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=114.8s)]
*  Prime Minister is doing a good job of navigating the space and not getting caught up in direct [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=120.32s)]
*  battles on tariffs. So where are those opportunities? Where can the UK stand out here? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=126.88s)]
*  Well, the big opportunities, the big economic opportunities in trade are twofold. First of all, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=132.64s)]
*  there's a $10 trillion opportunity up for grabs by simply transforming and modernising trade systems. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=136.96s)]
*  The US and UK are perfectly positioned to help lead that drive across the whole global system. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=143.84s)]
*  And that includes the deployment of technology across the whole trading ecosystem to make trade [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=150.4s)]
*  cheaper, faster and simpler for everybody. Everybody wins from that. And the second big [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  opportunity is a $2.7 trillion chance to improve access to finance, working capital for small [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  businesses. And to do that, we have to shake up the regulatory system, which is suffocating [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=168.72s)]
*  access to finance. And again, the US and UK are perfectly positioned to begin that process and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=175.12s)]
*  lead it globally. But I think we have to appeal to Donald Trump's business acumen, I think, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=182.0s)]
*  is the real opportunity. Tariff wars are nobody wins. But there are real win-wins here that I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=188.48s)]
*  think would really appeal to him and where he can play a leading role globally and benefit US [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=195.36s)]
*  businesses. Everybody wins. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohclRQP4Tyo&t=200.48000000000002s)]
