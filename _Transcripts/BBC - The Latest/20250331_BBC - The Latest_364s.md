Video Description: The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been found guilty of embezzling EU funds and barred from standing in an election for five years, with immediate effect.  The court’s verdict is a catastrophic setback for Le Pen which is likely to end her ambition to run for President in 2027. 

Le Pen was also given a four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended. The other two can be spent with an electronic tag in home detention rather than in custody.  She has also been handed a 100,000 euro fine.

The judge said Le Pen had been at the "heart of a system" which saw the embezzlement of €2.9m worth of European funds. Two dozen members of her party were also found guilty and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended.

Le Pen went on national television to claim the court’s verdict was “political”.   "I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this," Le Pen told French TV station TF1. She will appeal against the verdict "as soon as possible" she said, with "whatever legal avenues I can." "Millions of French people are outraged" she said, claiming that judges have "implemented measures that are reserved for authoritarian regimes." 

Shortly before her sentencing, Le Pen received messages of support from the Kremlin, as well as European allies such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini.

But some of Le Pen's political opponents have also said they disapproved of the judge's decision.   Centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou was reported to be “troubled" by the ruling while Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the far-left France Unbowed said: 
"The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people.”

*  In a defiant television interview tonight, the leader of France's hard-right anti-immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=0.0s)]

*  Her comments came after she was banned from public office for five years, meaning she [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  won't be able to run in the country's presidential election in two years' time, after being [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=17.06s)]
*  found guilty of embezzling European funds in order to finance her party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=21.78s)]
*  She claimed the judges had handed down today a ruling worthy of authoritarian regimes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=27.22s)]
*  Marine Le Pen had been viewed by many as the frontrunner to win the next presidential election. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=34.54s)]
*  As we can see from the last set of election results in France, support for her political [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=40.26s)]
*  party and its allies, shown here in the blue, stretches across many parts of the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=45.3s)]
*  Our Europe editor Katja Adler is in Paris for us tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=52.42s)]
*  Katja? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=57.42s)]
*  Well, Jane, there was pretty much a sharp intake of breath across the country when the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=58.42s)]
*  Le Pen verdict became known. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=64.4s)]
*  The judge really dragged out the drama. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=66.5s)]
*  And TVs were on, in bars and cafes, people were listening on the metro and in their offices. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  She is a huge political figure here in France. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=76.12s)]
*  The face of the nationalist right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=80.06s)]
*  And even though, as you say, she has come out fighting, defiant, she's going to appeal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=82.3s)]
*  the verdict, she says. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=86.62s)]
*  Deep down, she knows. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=88.06s)]
*  This could spell the end of her political career and the ends to her long-cherished [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=90.06s)]
*  hope of becoming France's next president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=95.26s)]
*  Silent fury oozing out of her, Marine Le Pen marched out of the Paris courthouse today, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=100.58s)]
*  even before the final verdict. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=108.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=111.42s)]
*  It was perfectly clear, she said on French TV tonight, the judge was out to bar her from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  running for president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=120.86s)]
*  Monday, 31st of March, is a dark day for our democracy and our country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  Millions of French voters are being deprived of their favorite presidential candidate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=129.06s)]
*  If that isn't a political decision, I don't know what is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=134.46s)]
*  Today's sentencing sent shockwaves around France, even amongst those who aren't natural [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=138.54s)]
*  allies of Le Pen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=143.86s)]
*  The BBC visited Moinsac in the rural southwest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=145.52s)]
*  I think this whole thing is political, to stop Le Pen becoming France's next president. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=150.26s)]
*  She was in poor position. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=155.18s)]
*  I don't share her values at all, but I believe everyone has the right to run as a political [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=157.94s)]
*  candidate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=162.22s)]
*  The legal case dates back to Le Pen's years as a member of the European Parliament, ending [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=163.92s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=169.16s)]
*  Today, along with more than 20 others in her Rassemblement National Parti, she was convicted [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=171.16s)]
*  of creating fake jobs and contracts to divert EU cash, well over three million pounds worth [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=177.64s)]
*  for her party's operations in France. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  The judge banned her from standing for political office for five years and sentenced her to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=189.0s)]
*  jail. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=195.12s)]
*  Today's ruling has set off a political earthquake in France. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=196.12s)]
*  On the one hand, you have the hard right, the far right, who say this was an attempt [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=200.8s)]
*  to steal the presidency from them, their chance to reform France and make it great again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=205.4s)]
*  But there are wider implications. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  There are those who suggest the court was biased, that it took a criminal case against [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Marine Le Pen for political ends to stop her and her nationalist agenda. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=218.56s)]
*  This afternoon, a stony-faced Marine Le Pen headed to her party's headquarters outside [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=225.88s)]
*  Paris. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=231.52s)]
*  She's launching a legal appeal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=232.52s)]
*  They're launching an online petition to support her. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=234.96s)]
*  If she fails, this is the man waiting in the wings, Le Pen's political protégé, Jordan [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=240.2s)]
*  Bardella. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  29 years old, wildly popular in the polls, but considered by many as too inexperienced [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  for a bruising French presidential race. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=256.24s)]
*  France was already deeply divided before today's Le Pen ruling. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=260.8s)]
*  The schisms now run even deeper between those who believe justice has been done and others [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=265.6s)]
*  convinced French judges the French establishment is out to prevent the will of the people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  Katia, an extraordinary day where you are. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=279.44s)]
*  What sort of reaction are we hearing outside France? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=283.16s)]
*  Well, Jane, look, those political divisions that I was talking about here in France, you're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  announcing them across Europe because nationalist parties or hard-right parties, they're gaining [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=293.16s)]
*  in strength. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=298.36s)]
*  And today we saw hard-right political leaders from across Europe taking to the social media [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=299.44s)]
*  platform X in support of Marine Le Pen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=304.88000000000005s)]
*  Je suis Marine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=308.12s)]
*  I am Marine, said Victor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Gerd Wilders of the Netherlands said he was sure she would make it as France's next president. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=313.04s)]
*  The Kremlin in Russia even chimed in, interestingly criticising democracy in Europe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  And we heard a similar-toned tweet from Donald Trump this evening. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=325.0s)]
*  He referred to a previous speech by his vice president criticising, he said, the lack of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=328.72s)]
*  free speech here in Europe and the barring of people from the political process. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, Jane, if we think back to before the US presidential election and Donald Trump, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  all of those legal battles that he faced, that didn't harm his political support. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=344.04s)]
*  And what we could see here, whatever happens to Marine Le Pen, is that her party actually [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=348.92s)]
*  benefits from all of this press attention and even today's political verdict. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=354.24s)]
*  Sorry, today's judicial verdict, seen by her party as political. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdfG1aXgtA&t=359.64s)]
