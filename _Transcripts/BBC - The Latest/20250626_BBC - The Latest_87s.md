# Why is AOC calling for US President Donald Trump to be impeached? #Trump #US #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM)
*  President Trump has been accused of illegally striking Iran by a Democratic lawmaker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said he betrayed the American people and the US Constitution [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=3.6s)]
*  and wants him impeached. And some members of Trump's own party have also called the strikes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=7.92s)]
*  unconstitutional. So was Trump allowed to bomb Iran over the weekend without consulting lawmakers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=12.16s)]
*  in Congress here first? There are two parts of the US Constitution which matter on this, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=16.32s)]
*  Article 1 and Article 2. The first says the ability to declare war is a power which belongs [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=20.96s)]
*  the party government that AOC serves in, but that hasn't been used since World War II. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=26.64s)]
*  Article 2 says the president shall be the commander in chief of the army. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=30.96s)]
*  Legal experts say this means Trump can use military action under some circumstances, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=34.72s)]
*  which could include acting against actual or anticipated attacks or to advance other important [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=38.96s)]
*  national interests. This could potentially cover Iran developing a nuclear weapon, which a regime [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=44.08s)]
*  there denies, but which Trump says was the reason for these attacks. BBC Farifai spoke to five [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=48.4s)]
*  legal experts, four of which said Trump did have some authority to conduct the strikes under these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=52.72s)]
*  circumstances. The other said he didn't because there wasn't an immediate threat to the US. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=57.28s)]
*  One expert pointed out that there was a precedent for this, saying this authority has been [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=62.0s)]
*  repeatedly used by presidents throughout our history. And we found other recent examples of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=65.84s)]
*  this. President Obama conducted airstrikes on several countries without requesting permission [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=69.68s)]
*  from Congress first, and more recently Joe Biden did this during his presidency. Most lawmakers [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=73.52s)]
*  here in Congress have decided against the votes to impeach President Trump over his strikes on Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=78.48s)]
*  So the AOC's push for that appears to have been stopped in its tracks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NhmJ9DGCdM&t=83.2s)]
