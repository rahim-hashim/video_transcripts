# Iran missiles cause multiple casualties in Israel as Israeli strikes hit Tehran oil depot | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY)
*  in the Middle East where there have been fresh strikes and counter strikes overnight between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Iran. Now in a moment I'll show you some of the latest pictures that we've had into [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=5.76s)]
*  the BBC but first let me take you through the latest updates this hour. Iran fired two waves [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=10.96s)]
*  of missiles overnight towards Israel. At least eight people have been killed, more than 200 others [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=17.44s)]
*  have been injured. Meanwhile Israel launched attacks on the Iranian capital Tehran. It says [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=25.44s)]
*  its struck targets linked to Iran's nuclear program and it hit the Sharon oil depot in the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  north of the country. Well let me show you some of the pictures that we've had of that fire in from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=36.96s)]
*  Iran and you can see that it is raging at that Sharon oil depot. Now Iran's oil ministry says [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Israeli strikes targeted the depot and a fuel tank in Tehran, adding that the situation is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=50.0s)]
*  under control. Now the oil ministry also said that two major gas fields in a southern province [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  were also attacked. The Israel defense forces said it carried out air attacks on Tehran targeting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=62.88s)]
*  buildings linked to Iran's nuclear program, including the defense ministry. The strike on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  the oil depot appears to be the first attack on Iran's energy infrastructure. Iran meanwhile [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=74.96s)]
*  carried out another round of strikes on Israel with the country's state tv saying it had launched a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  wide drone attack while loud explosions were heard across Israel. These pictures are of the missiles [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=86.96s)]
*  and the defense systems in operation over Tel Aviv. Millions of people will have headed to their [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  shelters after getting alerts. Now officials said that the IAF was operating to intercept and strike [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=99.76s)]
*  when necessary to eliminate the threat but added that the defense is not hermetic. Now we are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=105.28s)]
*  getting reports of all the casualties that are coming in. Now Israel's emergency service MDA [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  released these pictures of attending the scene of one of the strikes in a neighborhood in the northern [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  city of Tamra. Now Israeli media is reporting that at least four people were killed there. You can [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  see the images showing that rescue operation and the damage to the buildings from that Iranian [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=128.72s)]
*  missile strike. Meanwhile four people were killed in Bat Yam, that is a city in the Tel Aviv metropolitan [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=136.72s)]
*  area. Now these pictures show the aftermath of the Iranian strike there. A building really appears to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=145.2s)]
*  have been taken a direct hit by a missile. First responders of course scrambled to the scene [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=152.0s)]
*  looking through the debris to rescue the wounded. Now we know that four people died as I said. They [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=158.8s)]
*  were a woman in her 60s, a woman in her 80s, a boy around 10 years old and also a young girl. Now [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=164.64s)]
*  emergency services say 99 others were injured in this area. Four of them are in a serious condition. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=175.12s)]
*  You can see people trying to bring their pets out of that debris as well. Let me take you to the live [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  pictures now and this is the scene there and you can see that those buildings are been destroyed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=189.92s)]
*  The IDF is continuing its search and rescue mission at the site. Now local media reports say that around [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=197.84s)]
*  20 people are currently missing. Now earlier that number was around 35. Of course as we were [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=206.72s)]
*  mentioning this is a fluid situation so as people get accounted for it will take the emergency services [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=214.32s)]
*  a little time to know exactly how many people are missing in this debris that you can see. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=222.72s)]
*  I can also take you to the live pictures across Tel Aviv. We're also getting a report [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=230.8s)]
*  from the Reuters news agency saying that Yemen's Houthis say they targeted Israel with several [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=236.72s)]
*  ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours in coordination with Iran. So that just coming [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=244.32s)]
*  in on the Reuters news agency. Meanwhile the UK Prime Minister, Sakir Stama, says more British [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=252.16s)]
*  military jets are being sent to the region including typhoons and air-to-air refuelers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=258.24s)]
*  The Prime Minister told reporters he's neither ruling in nor out the prospect of British jets [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  helping Israel to respond to Iran's strikes as happened in April and October last year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=269.52s)]
*  Iran has told Britain, France and America that it'll target their ships and bases in the region [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=275.36s)]
*  if they support Israel. Well in the last hour President Trump has reacted to the latest strikes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=280.64s)]
*  on Iran by Israel. He posted this message on Truth Social. I'll read it to you now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=286.64s)]
*  So that's the latest post from President Trump. Let's go live to our Middle East correspondent [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=299.44s)]
*  Hugo Bishager who is in Jerusalem for us. And Hugo just bring us up to date on the injuries [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=318.0s)]
*  and casualties from those overnight strikes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=325.76s)]
*  Nikki, so it was another long night of attacks, the second night of Iranian attacks across Israel. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=331.2s)]
*  We had sirens across the country and obviously you know alerting people of the threat coming [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  from those missiles. So in the first wave of attacks a missile hit a residential area in the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=346.48s)]
*  town of Tamra which is a mainly Palestinian town in the north of the country. A house partially [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=352.8s)]
*  collapsed. At least four people were killed there and it seems that all the victims are women from [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=358.48s)]
*  the same family. Then hours later there was a second wave of attacks. We heard loud explosions [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=364.32000000000005s)]
*  here in Jerusalem as the air defense systems tried to intercept those missiles and a missile hit a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  residential building in the city of Bat Yam in the central part of Israel. There is a lot of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=377.84s)]
*  destruction there, a lot of damage and this morning emergency services are still searching [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  for those people who are still missing. The authorities are saying that more than 30 people [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=390.32s)]
*  are still missing there after this attack and again a lot of destruction there as this residential [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  area was hit by a missile. Now this followed you know more Israeli airstrikes on Iran. The targets [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=402.08s)]
*  included the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tehran and also sites that Israel says are linked [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=410.0s)]
*  to the country's nuclear program including a oil depot in what appears to be the first [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=415.76s)]
*  strike on Iran's energy infrastructure. We haven't had an update from the Iranian authorities yet in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=422.4s)]
*  terms of casualties but yesterday an Iranian official said more than 70 people had already [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=428.4s)]
*  been killed as a result of these Israeli airstrikes. Just seen that the president Hirsog saying that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=434.4s)]
*  it was a very sad and difficult morning. How is the fact that across Israel now they are seeing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  those pictures on their televisions of those buildings that have been destroyed. I know you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  went down to the scene of one of them yesterday. What impact is that going to have on Israelis? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=454.24s)]
*  Well I think you know people here were I think expecting that this could happen because the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=462.56s)]
*  Israeli authorities since the beginning of this campaign on Friday were alerting people that they [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=468.16s)]
*  were expecting a huge Iranian response with missiles and drones and they were telling the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=474.08s)]
*  people to stay alert to follow the instructions by the authorities to seek shelter you know during [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=480.32s)]
*  those attacks. Again I think you know this is the kind of the impact that this is going to have on [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=488.0s)]
*  the ground on people in Israel as this campaign continues and the indications from the Israeli [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=496.32s)]
*  authorities are that this is going to be a prolonged campaign. We're talking about weeks not days and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=502.56s)]
*  last night the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the attacks that have happened [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  so far the Israeli attacks were just the beginning were nothing compared with what would come [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=515.36s)]
*  next in Iran. So an indication that this is just the beginning. Hugo Bishaya live in Jerusalem. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=520.96s)]
*  Thank you. Well let's speak now to Ben Zala. He's a senior lecturer in politics and international [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=527.84s)]
*  relations at Monash University and joins me live from Melbourne. Thank you very much for your time [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  on BBC News. I wondered if I could pick up on one of the points that Hugo made there the fact that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=537.28s)]
*  in these latest strikes Israel appears to be targeting the fuel operation oil depots and other [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=542.72s)]
*  areas in Iran. That's right they've really now broadened out the attacks beyond just what was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  the initial stuff on the actual nuclear program itself hitting actual sites and then the targeted [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=560.72s)]
*  assassinations of key personnel in the military and in the nuclear program. This is now quite a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=566.16s)]
*  bit wider so we've had attacks on oil and gas fields also on airports. This appears to be trying [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=572.0s)]
*  to limit Iran's ability to respond. The Israelis always knew the Iranians would respond would [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  retaliate and they're trying to blunt that in any way they can. Do we have any idea yet the scale of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  the damage that has been done across Iran and in particular at those nuclear sites that you mentioned? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=592.88s)]
*  So it is still early days and it's probably going to take some time before we have a very accurate [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=600.24s)]
*  picture but we have some idea. I was just looking at some of the updated satellite images this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=606.32s)]
*  morning and these were mainly of the Natanz enrichment facility which has both an underground [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=612.08s)]
*  and an above ground aspect to it. We don't really know anything about the damage to the underground [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  facility but the above ground facility appears to have been very extensively damaged. There are [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  buildings that are just no longer there. There are structures that are completely obliterated. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=630.32s)]
*  This will really have put the program back by some margin. And what do you think the impact is going [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=634.96s)]
*  to be on normal Iranians? The fact that oil depots have been hit that might also have an impact on [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  the fact that they could even get petrol and other supplies. That's right. The impact will go [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=646.88s)]
*  well beyond just the military's ability to move assets around and respond to these Israeli attacks. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=653.68s)]
*  At some point this will be felt fairly widely in the Iranian population. That may also be part of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=660.96s)]
*  Israel's calculation here. It does appear certainly as part of the official statements even Benjamin [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=669.04s)]
*  Netanyahu's press conference that he gave when the initial attack was underway. He has been making [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=675.2s)]
*  statements and other officials have been making statements that are calling for the Iranian [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=681.36s)]
*  population to rise up against their own government. And so this may well be part of the Israeli [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=686.72s)]
*  calculation. They're trying to make life harder for the Iranian population in the short term [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  and make people reflect on whether their government is actually able to secure their [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=700.16s)]
*  interests and in their best interests to remain in place. And we've had this post from Donald [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump saying the US had nothing to do with the attacks on Iran tonight. If we're attacked in any [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=711.6s)]
*  way shape or form the full strength and might of the US armed forces will come down on you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=716.56s)]
*  Also saying a deal can be done. Where do you think this goes next? Extremely difficult to say of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  course. I know that's the disappointing answer but everyone really is watching with bated breath. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=729.12s)]
*  I think where it probably goes at least in the short term over the next few days is further [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=735.36s)]
*  attacks from the Israelis. Clearly they're doing this in stages. There were a number of nuclear [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=741.28s)]
*  sites particularly that at Fordow and Isfahan that weren't hit in the initial wave of attacks [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=746.96s)]
*  and have been since. So I expect more attacks from Israel. There will certainly be more retaliatory [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=751.36s)]
*  attacks from Iran. The key question will be whether any of those attacks go a little further [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0N5SG1MaTY&t=757.52s)]
