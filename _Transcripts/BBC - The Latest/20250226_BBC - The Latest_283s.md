Video Description: BP has announced it will slash its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.

The energy giant revealed its shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been much lower than its rivals.

BP said it would increase its oil and gas investment to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year in a reset aimed at boosting its returns.

The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's "drill baby drill" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.

# BP to slash green investment and ramp up gas and oil | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo)
*  Welcome back. Energy giant BP is set to announce a shake-up to its strategy that could weaken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=0.0s)]
*  its commitment to renewables. BP's profit after tax tumbled to $381 million last year, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=7.16s)]
*  which is significantly down from $15.2 billion in 2023 in the face of higher costs and weaker [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=15.16s)]
*  oil and gas prices. Investors have speculated that BP could this week abandon its pledge [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=22.64s)]
*  to reduce oil production by 25% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. It has already scaled back [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=28.62s)]
*  its climate plans with the target of reducing carbon emissions by 20-30% by the end of this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=36.34s)]
*  decade compared to 2019 levels, all this down from a previous target of 35-40%. British [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=42.24s)]
*  rival Shell and other oil majors have also cut back on clean energy objectives. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=50.14s)]
*  So a lot to discuss. We're joined by Cornelia Maia, who's an energy analyst and CEO of the Maia [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=55.22s)]
*  Resources. Joining us live, Cornelia, from Berlin. Welcome. Just talk us, what's your assessment [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  of this? How much is this a kickback in order to increase profits for shareholders and how much is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=65.66s)]
*  this being spurred on by Donald Trump's rhetoric of drill baby drill? It's both. Thank you for having [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=72.98s)]
*  me, Kasia. When you look at BP, its returns are at about 37% plus Shell is 77%, Exxon is 147%. So [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=80.9s)]
*  it's not as profitable as its peers. It trades with Exxon at 100% discount, with Shell at about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=97.86s)]
*  15% discount. So BP has not been doing well. It has traditionally been much more into renewables. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=105.98s)]
*  And the previous CEO, Bernard Looney, came with these very, very high targets. But those were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=116.1s)]
*  different times. That was when the IEA came out with its net zero strategy. And it was also just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  after during COVID. And then came the Ukraine war and the world really changed dramatically. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=131.06s)]
*  It's not arguably the only company going down this route. Shell and also the Norwegian company, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=138.26s)]
*  Equinor, have already been scaling back their plans to invest in green energy. Is this now the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=144.58s)]
*  direction of travel for these major companies in the energy sector? Not just for the energy sector. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=149.78s)]
*  When you look at the Glasgow Financial Alliance, GFANS, most of the big financial institutions have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=157.62s)]
*  opted out of it. So with the new Trump administration, the mood music, so to say, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=163.94s)]
*  has changed. But BP is the last to change. BP has been the most aggressive to go down that route. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=171.54s)]
*  Don't forget, it was Lord John Brown, who in 1997 came up with the idea of beyond petroleum. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=182.74s)]
*  So I think BP has waited the longest, has been the most aggressive on this. Plus, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=191.86s)]
*  BP has an activist investor, Elliott, who are very effective. They own about 5% of the shares. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=201.06s)]
*  They're very, very active in terms of telling them they need to change their ways. They want [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=208.1s)]
*  to see more profitability. And when you look, Elliott is very successful. When you look what [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=214.9s)]
*  they've done to some other companies, they usually get what they want. Obviously, environmental groups [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=220.26s)]
*  are really worried, but some shareholders are also expressing concern. What kind of sway do you think [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=227.7s)]
*  they have? Not so much because it's not the big shareholders. The big shareholders, the guys who, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=232.74s)]
*  40% of BP shares are held in America by US companies. So by US, big investors. So it's not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=239.06s)]
*  that, it's not, I don't think, BlackRock, for instance, owns 10%. They won't be that worried [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  about this anymore. Larry Fink was about five, six years back, very worried about the ESG agenda. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=258.74s)]
*  They're less worried about it now. Again, the mute music has changed materially and adversely [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=265.7s)]
*  against the ESG agenda. Energy analyst Cornelia Meyer, always good to get your perspective. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=273.3s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you very much, Cassia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeaCTjfpAo&t=278.82s)]
