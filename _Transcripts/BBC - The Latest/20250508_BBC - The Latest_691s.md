Video Description: Robert Prevost, 69, will be the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV.
 
He is the first American to fill the role of Pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru, before becoming a bishop there.
 
Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained as a priest in 1982. Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city.

# Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM)
*  Well, the choice of name, Pope Leo XIV, has been hailed by many as a significant one because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=0.0s)]
*  his predecessor, Pope Leo XIII, well his pontificate focused on social justice, on labour rights. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=9.6s)]
*  He was known as the social pope, the reformer. And we all know that the choice of name is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=17.0s)]
*  important. It sets out the new pope's vision for where he wants to take the church. Remember, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=24.6s)]
*  Pope Francis chose the name Francis because of Saint Francis of Assisi and what he meant [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=31.0s)]
*  to the poor and the marginalised. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, addressing the faithful from the balcony overseeing Saint Peter's Square, the new pope [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  said he wanted to build bridges and spoke of peace. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=47.92s)]
*  May the peace be with all of you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=51.84s)]
*  Brothers, sisters, dear friends, this is the first greeting of Christ resurrected, the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=63.24s)]
*  good shepherd who has given life for the flock of God. I would also like this greeting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=74.96s)]
*  of peace to enter into our house in order to reach all our families, your families, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=80.8s)]
*  to all people, wherever you are, to all people, to all of our earth. May peace be with you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=88.28s)]
*  Well, shortly after the announcement that Robert Prevost was elected as Pope Leo XIV, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=104.96s)]
*  President Trump congratulated him, saying that it was such an honour to realise that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  he is the first American pope. You can see here his true social post. The President also [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=119.16s)]
*  said he looked forward to meeting him, saying it will be a very meaningful moment. Well, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=124.56s)]
*  in person a short time ago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=132.16s)]
*  Again, to have the pope from the United States of America, that's a great honour. I'm watching [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=135.16s)]
*  him, they said he's from America. I said, that's great. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=146.16s)]
*  That was President Trump. Let's cross live now and join my colleague, Neda Taufik, who [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  joins me from St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Neda, what's the reaction been where you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=157.16s)]
*  are to the first American pope? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=162.96s)]
*  Well, certainly a lot of excitement, Mariam. Many people, in fact not just Catholics, but [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=166.16s)]
*  ordinary Americans as well, coming down to this cathedral, St Patrick's, on Fifth Avenue [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=173.76s)]
*  in Manhattan, where no less than five popes have visited in the past, including Pope Francis. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=179.76s)]
*  I was able to break the news to a few people who were walking by who were just absolutely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=186.72s)]
*  shocked that it was an American who was named as pope. But others came here because they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=190.72s)]
*  felt compelled, including Andy Richter, who is with me now. Andy, just talk to me about [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=196.52s)]
*  your reaction when you heard the news. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=202.32s)]
*  I was sitting in a doctor's office, just in the waiting room, and then my phone just exploded [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=204.12s)]
*  with news alerts from so many different agencies, American pope named. I was in absolute shock. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=209.32s)]
*  And then I was thrilled. I was absolutely thrilled. And then I found out he was the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=216.92s)]
*  Archbishop of Chicago. And I was thrilled for that because I know how strong both the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=222.92s)]
*  Chicago work ethic and the Catholic work ethic there is through friends of mine that live [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=227.32s)]
*  there. So I think it's a surprising yet splendid choice. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=231.92s)]
*  Did you ever think you would see an American pope? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=236.92s)]
*  Absolutely not. You know, I studied a bit of history and I remember when Jack Kennedy [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=239.12s)]
*  ran for president and some folks were afraid that somehow as a Catholic, America would [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=244.42s)]
*  be ruled by Rome. That was never the case. And I think in this case, it will be all of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  the sensibilities that the new pope brings from every place in the world that he's been [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=258.62s)]
*  that will guide his papacy, which is something that I prayed for here today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  Tell us what you prayed for inside. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=267.82s)]
*  Well, I learned the hard way that God works through the people that are put around you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  And I do believe that if this pope was chosen so quickly, after two days of a conclave, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  I think the movie was actually longer than this conclave, then all of the other cardinals [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=282.92s)]
*  did see that God works through this person in a way that he deserves to be the next leader [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=289.02s)]
*  of the church. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=295.14s)]
*  And you told me you prayed for the pope as part of your prayer. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  I did, absolutely. You know, in spirit of that God working through human beings that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=298.42s)]
*  God continue to guide this new pope as he guides the church and so many more that even [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=305.42s)]
*  the non-Catholics that he inspires through that kind of work, he'll lead the church and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=311.42s)]
*  humanity well into the 21st century. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=315.94s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that you were a fan of Pope Francis. Pope Leo is supposed to really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=318.42s)]
*  kind of carry on a lot of his legacy and work. What do you make of that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=325.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, when I heard that Pope Francis had appointed 80% of the cardinals [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=330.42s)]
*  in the conclave, I knew that somehow they were all people that believed in what Francis [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=335.12s)]
*  believed. So, though the speculation was that a more conservative pope might be in the running, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  I just didn't see that happening because they know that the Catholic Church is headed in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=346.22s)]
*  such a positive direction despite its issues. I'm a lapsed Catholic with my own issues with [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=350.32s)]
*  the church, but I couldn't be more thrilled with the good work that will continue under [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=355.06s)]
*  Pope Leo's tutelage. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=361.46s)]
*  Of course we say he's an American pope, but he also has Peruvian citizenship. Spent a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=363.06s)]
*  lot of time there, loved it, and that's why he's being called the Latin Yankee. What do [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=368.46s)]
*  you make of the fact that you do have a pope that is really representing the Americas in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=373.86s)]
*  such a way? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=378.16s)]
*  I think it's a wonderful bridge that we were lacking, and I think in this political environment, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=378.76s)]
*  this particular environment that the United States finds itself in, I think it'll be a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=386.26s)]
*  great counterbalance for us as I think this pope will also work on trying to bridge that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=390.36s)]
*  gap that suddenly emerged between the United States and the rest of the Americas because [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=398.56s)]
*  his heart is in both places. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  Andy, thank you so much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=404.06s)]
*  No, it's been my pleasure. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=405.36s)]
*  As you can see, Mariam, a lot of excitement, a lot of people here really just shocked that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  they thought they'd never see the day to have an American pope and one, as Andy was just [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=411.86s)]
*  saying there, that does really represent the Americas in such a way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=417.26000000000005s)]
*  It does indeed. Neda, thank you very much. Yes, it represents the Americas because of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  course, as we just saw there, Pope Leo XIV means so much to North Americans because he [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=428.26000000000005s)]
*  was born in Chicago. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=434.36s)]
*  He was Bishop of Chicago, but he only lived there till he was 27. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=435.36s)]
*  He then moved out of the US and at some point he fell in love with the country of Peru and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=438.76s)]
*  now holds dual Peruvian and US citizenship. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=446.36s)]
*  Well, let's take a moment now to reflect on Pope Leo and what he means for the Church. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=451.26s)]
*  Father Eamon Conway is chair of the Peter Huneman Foundation for the Advancement of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  Catholic Theology in Europe and it's such a pleasure to talk to you, Father. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=460.96s)]
*  Thank you for joining me on such a historic evening and just if I can ask you first of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=464.56s)]
*  all for your thoughts and feelings at this deeply personal time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=468.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very pleased. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm very grateful. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=474.85999999999996s)]
*  I was particularly moved watching the images from the square even before we knew who the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=476.85999999999996s)]
*  new pope was. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  The extraordinary sense of joy that there would be a pope, particularly so many young [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=482.96s)]
*  people that were there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  It was a tremendous act of faith. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=488.26s)]
*  Can you imagine any other organization where even before we know who is elected that we [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=490.16s)]
*  cheer and I think that's a tremendous statement about the future of the Church and the energy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=494.66s)]
*  in the Church and then it was mentioned there a moment ago the tears in Pope Leo's eyes. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=498.86s)]
*  I think there was an extraordinary dynamic already between him and those who are gathered [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=505.36s)]
*  in the square. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=509.36s)]
*  So I'm full of joy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm full of hope. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=511.06s)]
*  My friends will bear witness to the fact that I actually I said to myself and we don't need [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=512.66s)]
*  if we can't elect or won't elect one of the frontrunners it could well be Cardinal Prevost [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=518.46s)]
*  and I actually said that in advance because I thought there was a quiet unassuming but [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=523.96s)]
*  firm nature in him that I observed during the Synod of Bishops where I was present at [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=528.26s)]
*  and a man who is a details man who will follow up maybe in a lot of the of the detail work [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  that's needed for Pope Francis's Synodal pathway to continue. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=539.76s)]
*  But at the same time as we're as we're aware now and if you just look at his Twitter [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  feed maybe look quickly before it might be taken down. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=547.6600000000001s)]
*  He's extraordinarily clear and firm on social justice issues as you've already been commenting [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=550.86s)]
*  on and then choice of the name of course brings him right back to something pivotal in terms [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=556.46s)]
*  of articulating the Church's teaching on social justice. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  So we're going to have somebody who's going to do a lot of reform within the Church. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=565.26s)]
*  I believe continue the reform of Pope Francis, but who will also be a very clear moral voice [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  and the fact that he's an American may be coincidental, but I do believe it's actually [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=572.8599999999999s)]
*  providential at this time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=578.26s)]
*  Why do you think it's providential? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=581.76s)]
*  Because I think we need a strong America voice in a certain sense to balance what's coming [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=583.66s)]
*  out of North America at the moment particularly out of the US and I think we're going to find [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=588.66s)]
*  he may not intend to be political, but he will stand for justice and for truth and for [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=592.56s)]
*  love in a very strong way. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=597.66s)]
*  Just look at what he said for me immediately after JD Vance's statement on on immigration. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=599.26s)]
*  He came out very strongly. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=604.66s)]
*  He said JD Vance is wrong at colon. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=605.76s)]
*  He said Jesus Christ does not allow us to rank our love. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=608.76s)]
*  That's a very strong statement very succinct, which I think is the nature of the man but [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  uncompromising. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=617.66s)]
*  And did uncompromising succinct comment to JD Vance as a Cardinal will he do you think [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=620.56s)]
*  take the similar lines as Pope because it's different isn't it when you become Pope you [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=625.96s)]
*  have to become a bit more of a diplomat? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=630.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think and I think that would be what people would want and expect in the role. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  Above all, he has to be, you know, witness to unity, but I don't think he's going to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=637.26s)]
*  change his position on that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=643.0600000000001s)]
*  That is the teaching of Jesus Christ. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=644.36s)]
*  So, you know, that's what he's been elected to represent. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=646.26s)]
*  So I don't think he'll change that but I think he will keep channels of communication [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=648.76s)]
*  open. He'd probably be in many respects have more of a diplomatic style to him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=653.06s)]
*  But, you know, he if you look at his career, look at his vocation, he lived and worked [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=657.56s)]
*  among the poorest of the poor in Latin America. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  He knows and feels the pain of those who are who are affected by policies that exclude [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  by policies that that make the poor poor that damage our climate. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=672.66s)]
*  He's not going to I don't think he's going to pull back from that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=678.3599999999999s)]
*  Father Eamon Conway, it's so good to have you on the program. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q1y_ls2OM&t=683.3599999999999s)]
