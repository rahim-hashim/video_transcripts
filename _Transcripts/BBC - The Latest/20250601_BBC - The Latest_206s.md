Video Description: Ukraine claims to have hit more than 40 Russian warplanes at several military airfields, in what appears to be one of the most audacious drone attacks so far on Russian aviation.
 
According to a statement from Ukraine's security service, SBU, "enemy strategic bombers are burning en masse in Russia".
 
The SBU said Ukraine is conducting "a large-scale special operation aimed at destroying enemy bomber aircraft."
 
Dramatic footage has emerged purportedly showing a drone attack at Belaya airbase in Irkutsk oblast, Siberia, thousands of miles from Ukraine.
 
Russia's military has not commented on the issue.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y)
*  Now let's turn to some breaking news in the last half hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And Ukraine claims to have hit more than 40 Russian bombers, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=3.52s)]
*  in what the country's security service says [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=6.96s)]
*  is a large-scale special operation aimed at destroying [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=9.24s)]
*  enemy bomber aircraft. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=12.6s)]
*  Ukraine's released this footage, which it says shows a drone [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=14.64s)]
*  attack at the Belaya Air Base in Siberia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=17.52s)]
*  And on the footage, which I don't believe [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=21.64s)]
*  we are able to actually show you at the moment, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  but you can see explosions visible with smoke rising. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Reports suggest other aircraft have been attacked [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=29.2s)]
*  at the Olenya Air Base near Mermansk. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=31.6s)]
*  Well, Russian media is reporting the attack in Mermansk, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=34.44s)]
*  but says air defences are working. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=36.96s)]
*  Well, let's go straight to our World Affairs correspondent, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=39.2s)]
*  Paul Adams, who is in Kyiv. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=41.44s)]
*  Paul, this is just a developing story, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=43.8s)]
*  so just tell us what more you can add to what we've said. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly developing, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and the information is coming thick and fast. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, Ukrainians have experienced moments of euphoria [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=54.8s)]
*  when their military has conducted successful operations [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=60.8s)]
*  against major Russian military targets in the past. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=65.92s)]
*  One thinks about the attack on the flagship [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=68.56s)]
*  of the Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=70.96s)]
*  and the attack on the Kerch Bridge, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=73.08s)]
*  both of those back in 2022. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=75.08s)]
*  Already, people here are beginning to wonder [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=77.92s)]
*  whether what happened this morning [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=80.28s)]
*  is the most audacious operation so far. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=83.0s)]
*  Attacks on four separate air bases, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  one of them that you just referred to, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=89.32s)]
*  is 4,000 kilometres from Ukraine's border, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=91.32s)]
*  the other one up in the Arctic Circle, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  well over 1,000 kilometres. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=97.32s)]
*  And if the Ukrainian officials are to be believed, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=99.8s)]
*  a very, very significant toll [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=103.28s)]
*  in terms of Russia's strategic aviation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  The pictures that we have seen, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  and there are a lot of them around now, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=109.24s)]
*  show drones attacking large strategic bombers [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  parked on the tarmac in those air bases. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=115.76s)]
*  Now, we can't verify at this point the extent of the damage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=119.08s)]
*  The drones involved were probably quite small ones. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=123.56s)]
*  It'll be interesting to find out how this operation was launched. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=126.68s)]
*  Judging by the size of those drones, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=130.08s)]
*  it was probably launched from inside Russia, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=132.04s)]
*  which makes the attack even more audacious [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=135.12s)]
*  than it might be otherwise. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=138.56s)]
*  But clearly, this is a very significant attack [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=141.04s)]
*  on the kinds of aircraft that Russia uses day in, day out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=144.0s)]
*  to launch missiles against targets across the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=149.16s)]
*  And by the way, last night's attack involving drones [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=154.0s)]
*  and ballistic and cruise missiles [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=157.72s)]
*  was the largest single Russian attack on Ukraine so far, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=159.92s)]
*  with more than 470 drones. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=164.0s)]
*  That's the largest single number of drones [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=167.0s)]
*  targeted at Ukraine in a single night. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, as we ponder the possibility [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=172.12s)]
*  of a second round of peace talks in Istanbul tomorrow, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  it's hard to see how those talks can possibly yield anything [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=179.6s)]
*  of any great significance if they happen at all. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  Indeed. Paul Adams in Kiev. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much for that update. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=187.64s)]
*  And we're just hearing on the AFP news agency [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=190.0s)]
*  that the Russian delegation is heading to Istanbul [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=193.0s)]
*  for those talks with Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=197.04s)]
*  And they're quoting Russian news agencies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=199.92s)]
*  So, of course, it will be interesting to see [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=202.0s)]
*  what comes out of those talks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6SbePVg8Y&t=203.92s)]
