*  suspended. Two people were acquitted. Kim Kardashian says the robbery had been the most [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  terrifying experience of her life. Andrew Harding has this report and a warning. It [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=22.04s)]
*  does contain some flashing images. In central Paris, justice at long last in the case of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=27.86s)]
*  the Kardashian jewel heist. It was last week that Kim Kardashian, global celebrity in black [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=35.7s)]
*  and diamonds here, flew into the French capital to give evidence at the trial. She described [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=43.9s)]
*  her terror that she would be raped or killed by the masked robbers who entered her Paris [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=50.1s)]

*  leniency that the accused were pleading for in court. Many of them are now elderly and sick. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=63.74s)]
*  Like 71 year old Eunice Abbas, who's wrestling with Parkinson's. He's described the Kardashian [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=70.54s)]
*  jewel heist as a final job before retirement. I was hesitant. I thought I was too old. But in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=78.78s)]
*  the end, I took up the challenge. As soon as the job was done, I regretted it. Kardashian had been [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=87.3s)]
*  in Paris for fashion week. The gang appears to have targeted her after seeing her with her jewelry [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=94.18s)]
*  on social media. She was bound and gagged at gunpoint before the thieves escaped. The stolen [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=99.42s)]
*  jewels themselves, gold and diamonds worth perhaps six million pounds, were probably smuggled out of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=106.54s)]
*  France, broken up and sold. They've never been found. As for the gang, the jury found almost all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  of them guilty. But no more time in prison for any of the elderly criminals who've waited nine [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  years for justice. There were probably two reasons. First, the age of those people. And second, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=127.98s)]
*  probably the time, you know, between the facts and the trial. As for Kim Kardashian, in a statement, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=135.86s)]
*  she thanked French justice, described the robbery as the most terrifying experience of her life, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=144.62s)]
*  and prayed for healing for all concerned. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Paris. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Qpp4pEbYA&t=150.3s)]
