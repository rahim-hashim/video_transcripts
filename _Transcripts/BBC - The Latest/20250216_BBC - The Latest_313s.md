Video Description: The family of a British couple in custody in Iran said they are united in their determination to secure their safe return.

Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention emerged on Thursday when state-run Iranian media reported they were being held on unspecified security charges.

The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world, and had planned to be in Iran for only five days.

*  We're about to set off. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=46.2s)]

*  They were only meant to be in Iran for five days. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=55.92s)]
*  But things didn't go according to plan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=59.32s)]
*  On the 30th of December Lindsay and Craig crossed from Armenia to Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=61.68s)]

*  But that's when their family lost all contact with them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=74.12s)]
*  The couple were planning on crossing to Pakistan the next day. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=77.2s)]
*  This was Lindsay's last post on social media. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=81.03999999999999s)]

*  and respect for one another. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=93.4s)]
*  Then on Wednesday Iranian state media released this photo. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=95.64s)]
*  Their faces are blurred and they're meeting with the British ambassador Hugo Shulter at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=99.32s)]
*  the public prosecutor's office in Kirman. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=103.2s)]
*  In a statement their family have said, this unexpected turn of events has caused significant [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=106.48s)]
*  concern for our entire family and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=111.56s)]
*  wellbeing during this trying time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Are you happy with your bike? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  I am now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  Lindsay and Craig said they were aware of the risks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=121.92s)]
*  In a post she explained, we are facing our fears and defying recommendations from friends, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  family and the FCDO travel advice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=130.4s)]
*  The Foreign Office currently advises British nationals to avoid all travel to Iran. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=133.88s)]
*  Dozens of foreign and dual nationals have been arrested in Iran in recent years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=140.84s)]
*  The charges are often vague and security related. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=145.12s)]
*  But so far Iranian authorities have not said what Lindsay and Craig are accused of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=148.64s)]
*  The Foreign Office has said it's in contact with local authorities in Iran and is providing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=154.28s)]
*  the couple with consular assistance. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=158.28s)]
*  As for their family, they say they're united and determined to secure their safe return. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=161.04s)]
*  Azadeh Mashiri, BBC News, Islamabad. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=166.76s)]
*  Let's get more on this with our correspondent Thomas McGill who is at the Foreign Office [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=171.32s)]
*  in central London. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=174.32s)]
*  Thomas, welcome to you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=175.32s)]
*  So what more do we know about this couple? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=176.32s)]
*  Well, there are lots of unanswered questions this morning that remain, particularly coming [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=180.92s)]
*  from the family who the BBC have spoken to overnight and they say that they have still [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=186.48s)]
*  got no idea regarding the charges that the couple face or indeed where they are detained [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  in the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=198.2s)]
*  Now the Foreign Office advice has always been clear. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=199.44s)]
*  They advise against all travel to Iran by British nationals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=202.04s)]
*  And as you heard in Azadeh's report there, both Lindsay and Craig Foreman were aware [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  of the risk. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  And indeed, Lindsay commented or addressed that issue in one of her social media posts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  before entering the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=219.56s)]
*  She says, we're aware of the risks, but we also know the rewards of meeting incredible [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=221.76s)]
*  people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=227.16s)]
*  Now, there are growing tensions between Iran and the West, including the UK and the US. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=228.16s)]
*  And there have been others detained in recent months and years, again from the UK and from [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=235.92s)]
*  the US and from other countries in Europe as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=241.56s)]
*  And they're often used as leverage or bargaining chips by authorities in Iran when it comes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=246.04s)]
*  to political negotiations following sanctions, years of sanctions imposed upon that country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=252.8s)]
*  You may remember one high profile detainee from the UK, Nazneen Zaghari Ratcliffe. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=259.92s)]
*  She spent six years in a prison there before high level negotiations led to her release [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=265.56s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=271.72s)]
*  So you understand the family's concerns when they say they have significant concerns over [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=274.0s)]
*  these latest developments. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  But there is perhaps a glimmer of hope because we do know from the statement from the Foreign [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=282.04s)]
*  Office over the last 24 hours that they are negotiating with authorities there regarding [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=286.84s)]
*  their release. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=293.88s)]
*  But unclear as to why we're only finding out about this now and indeed the staging of those [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=294.88s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=302.24s)]
*  And whilst there are all these unanswered questions, the worrying and the waiting continue [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=303.24s)]
*  for the family and all those involved. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=309.2s)]
*  OK, Thomas, thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdS8FEGbIS0&t=311.36s)]
