**BBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0)
*  What went wrong between Donald Trump and Elon Musk? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=0.0s)]
*  After months of being close allies, the fallout between one of the world's most powerful men [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=2.72s)]
*  and the world's richest man has turned very public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=7.28s)]
*  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=9.92s)]
*  Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we'll well anymore. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=11.92s)]
*  And Musk posted on X saying, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=15.76s)]
*  Without me, Trump would have lost the election. Such ingratitude. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=17.6s)]
*  Musk also posted this on X. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=21.36s)]
*  This led Trump to reply that Elon was going crazy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=23.84s)]
*  and he plans to sell his Tesla in the newest development. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=26.96s)]
*  So when did the alliance begin to sour? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=29.92s)]
*  Well, when Musk left the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=31.92s)]
*  he repeatedly slammed Trump's budget plan, calling it a disgusting abomination [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  packed with wasteful spending. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Trump suggested Musk's real gripe was over cuts to electric vehicle subsidies, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=42.08s)]
*  a claim that Musk denies. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=46.32s)]
*  Even Elon Musk's dad got involved. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=47.84s)]
*  It blew up over Elon's idea that there should be no payment to lawmakers in order to get their vote. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=49.92s)]
*  So Elon is standing on principle. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=57.6s)]
*  The White House says the bill will strengthen the economy, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=59.52s)]
*  but critics say it will add $2.4 trillion to national debt [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=62.0s)]
*  and leave millions without health cover. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=65.68s)]
*  But what's fair to say is that the bromance between Musk and Trump is over. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGWx4k58U0&t=67.76s)]
