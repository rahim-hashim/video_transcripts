# Inside the brand new city 'built on scams' on the Myanmar-Thai border | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4)
*  The government in Thailand says it is trying to shut down the criminal scam compounds which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=0.0s)]
*  have proliferated in recent years along its border with Myanmar by cutting electricity supplies [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and tightening banking and visa regulations. This follows the rescue last month of a well-known [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=11.28s)]
*  Chinese actor and several other people who'd been abducted and forced to work in the scam centres. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=17.12s)]
*  The scam business is believed to earn the mainly Chinese crime bosses many billions of dollars [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=23.92s)]
*  every year and has trapped thousands in forced labour. It's resulted in a frenzy of building [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=29.76s)]
*  over on the Myanmar side of the border. The most ambitious of these projects is the newly built [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=35.52s)]
*  city of Shwe Koko, a 15 billion dollar investment promising casinos, luxury hotels and entertainment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=41.52s)]
*  complexes. Until recently it was off limits to journalists but our Southeast Asia correspondent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=49.36s)]
*  Jonathan Head was allowed limited access by the Chinese company which runs it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=54.8s)]
*  Well there are few places on earth stranger than this one and it looks just like a provincial [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=60.8s)]
*  Chinese city. There are Chinese characters on the sides of all the buildings and Chinese staff [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=66.8s)]
*  are running the place yet this isn't in China. It's in Myanmar's Karen state, one of the poorest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  and most isolated parts of Asia where an insurgent group has been waging war against the state for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=77.92s)]
*  more than 70 years. So why has the Chinese company called Yatai built all of this? It's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=84.16s)]
*  promising a 15 billion dollar project complete with casinos, luxury villas and cyber parks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=92.32s)]
*  The reason, say Yatai's critics, is scam centres, human trafficking and money laundering. Yatai's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  boss, a Chinese man called Xie Zhejiang, is currently languishing in a Thai prison wanted by the Chinese [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=106.24s)]
*  government for being a gambling kingpin. Well we've been driving around Shui Kok for a while now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=112.32s)]
*  and this really is the most extraordinary place. Technically we are in the middle of a war zone in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=118.88s)]
*  Myanmar and yet the scale of the building, the ambition of this project is breathtaking. What's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=124.24s)]
*  much less clear though is what the business model is. I mean they say they've ended the scams and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  the human trafficking but looking around at all this it's you just can't figure out where the money's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=134.48s)]
*  coming from to fund it. Yatai had invited us to see Shui Kok as they call their city to show they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=139.44s)]
*  hoped a different side. It's a safe green city they kept telling us. Everywhere they've put up [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=147.68s)]
*  these huge billboards promising in three languages that forced labor and human trafficking are no [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=156.16s)]
*  longer permitted. On the streets we saw only the local Karen people who come here to work in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=162.8s)]
*  hotels and restaurants. There was unexpectedly a library and even a not entirely convincing branch [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=168.72s)]
*  of Starbucks but we saw few customers. They allowed us to see only the outsides of all the buildings. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=177.52s)]
*  It's private they said when we asked to go in. Some local people quietly told us that the scam [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=185.04s)]
*  business still thrives here. You could see bars on the insides of the windows. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=192.08s)]
*  At night Shui Kok lights up with nine casinos supposedly for Chinese gamblers but there are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=199.28s)]
*  a few visitors. They allowed us to see these spectacular karaoke rooms though in them we met [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=206.96s)]
*  only these young Chinese women who work here and all the time from screens on the walls [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=214.4s)]
*  the face of the now jailed Xie Zhe Jiang looked down at us extolling his vision of a shining new city. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=221.76s)]
*  Well let's speak to our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Jonathan hello to you. I mean journalists are rarely allowed into these kinds of projects. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=234.64s)]
*  Why do you think the Chinese company Yatai wanted the BBC there? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=239.68s)]
*  Well our best guess is that they're in some trouble. It's clear that this somewhat enigmatic [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=244.64s)]
*  figure Xie Zhe Jiang who is in a Thai prison is very important to the project. They really look [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=250.24s)]
*  up to him as their leader. They almost worshiped him in a way and they feel they can't progress [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  without with him being stuck in prison but also it's affecting the confidence of people who might [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=260.08s)]
*  be putting money into this this city and really what struck us was that there's a lot of these [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=264.16s)]
*  compounds that have sprung up along the Thai Myanmar border. Of course there were in other [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=270.72s)]
*  parts of Asia before that. Mostly they're pretty low key just you know basic buildings people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=274.64s)]
*  are crammed in there are made to carry out these scams. It's clear that Yatai has aimed a great [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=280.08s)]
*  deal higher that they genuinely do believe they can build something bigger than just the scams, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=284.8s)]
*  a genuine resort. It seems a bit crazy to think you can do that in that remote war-torn part of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  Myanmar but I think they believe it and they've put so much investment in they're now really [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  struggling. I don't think they're getting you know access has become very difficult. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=300.64s)]
*  The border's sealed. They can't you can't. Myanmar's a war zone you can't get there [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=304.32s)]
*  and I just think that the negative publicity out the scams has really hurt them and they're [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=308.4s)]
*  trying to persuade us that there's something different and I think they are different [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  but the reality as we found when we're there is there just isn't any other viable business you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  can run in an area like that except for these scams. Well yeah I mean as you say they're alluded [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=322.96s)]
*  to the company's sort of claiming to have ended the scams but you know what what can you make of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=328.0s)]
*  those claims having seen it on the ground? They're not credible. I think what the company has done [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=333.12s)]
*  is in an alliance with this local armed group which is which protects them and has given them [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=339.92s)]
*  the land they're trying to push the most abusive forms of scamming out of Shwe Kok and that they're [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=344.88s)]
*  tending to move to these other much smaller scam compounds further south but the actual scam business [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=350.32s)]
*  even if it's run by workers who do it voluntarily is going on and you know we met a young woman who'd [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=355.68s)]
*  been working there just a few days before we got there and she spelled out exactly how they did it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=362.0s)]
*  and she said it's right across the city in every building. These were the buildings we were looking [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=367.04s)]
*  at so they all had bars on the windows they had labels saying that they're representing them as [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=371.6s)]
*  obscure financial services. We were never allowed to look inside but she told us all of them have [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=376.8s)]
*  scams operating and yes the workers are working there voluntarily but of course there are victims [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=381.68s)]
*  of these scams there are huge numbers of people around the world being defrauded of their savings. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=386.48s)]
*  Yeah and I guess not just there the scams sort of along this the Myanmar Thailand border and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=391.12s)]
*  I understand we're also mentioned when the Thai Prime Minister met with President Chi yesterday. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah this is the first visit for this young Thai Prime Minister since she came to office last [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=402.4s)]
*  year to China it's a very important relationship both governments I would argue have been pretty [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=406.4s)]
*  slack about addressing the scam problem in this region. China of course moved against scams on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=411.68s)]
*  its own border just over a year ago very decisively but it's causing such a fuss because it is a lot [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=417.12s)]
*  of Chinese people are being both defrauded but also being lured and forced abducted to work in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=423.68s)]
*  these scams. You need Chinese speakers to get the victims and so we had a Chinese actor who [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=429.52s)]
*  was abducted last month and then rescued his case went viral on social media and both governments [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=437.04s)]
*  realise now it really is damaging they have to do something that is a real problem particularly [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=443.2s)]
*  for Shui Koku these moves going against them the cutting of power of telecoms of all sorts [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=447.68s)]
*  of other access are going to make it very difficult for them to function. Jonathan will have to leave [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=452.24s)]
*  it there but it's a really fascinating insight thank you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRbYZZa1UX4&t=456.88s)]
