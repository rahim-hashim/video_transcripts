Video Description: The UK government has confirmed a U-turn on its cuts to disability benefits in a bid to avert a rebellion by more than 120 Labour backbenchers.
People who currently receive personal independence payments (Pip), or the health element of universal credit, will continue to do so.
Instead, changes will apply only to new claimants from November 2026.

# UK government U-turn over planned benefit reforms | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4)
*  Now let's turn to the big story in the UK today, a major U-turn by the government which will make [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=0.0s)]
*  changes to its planned benefits reforms after a wave of pressure from Labour MPs. The climb down [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=6.4s)]
*  is a blow to Prime Minister Sakiya Starmer's authority as more than 120 MPs from his own party [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=12.32s)]
*  publicly criticised the government's plans. Our political correspondent Damian Gramatikis reports. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=18.64s)]
*  Sakiya Starmer saluted this week as he visited Royal Marines training in Holland. But it's his [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=23.52s)]
*  own troops among his backbenchers he's struggled to control and who forced him into the most [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=30.64s)]
*  significant retreat of his premiership with this U-turn over key benefit cuts. More than 120 had [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=35.44s)]
*  said publicly they'd block his reforms to disability and sickness benefits. When they say cut back we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=42.64s)]
*  say. The original plan was to limit who receives some benefits and cut others to save five billion [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=49.28s)]
*  pounds. Now Liz Kendall the work and pension secretary has written to rebel MPs saying there'll be no [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=56.88s)]
*  change for those currently receiving PIPs, no cuts for those currently receiving universal credits [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=63.44s)]
*  health element. New claimants will face cuts but support to help people back to work will be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=69.44s)]
*  increased and disability rights groups will be consulted on the reforms. Ms Kendall said we have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=76.16s)]
*  listened to colleagues who support the principle of reform but are worried about the impact of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  pace of change. These are really important changes and shows that how labor supports the most [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=87.36s)]
*  vulnerable and also this overall package is about helping people get into work which is absolutely [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=92.4s)]
*  a core labor value. I'm going to be backing it now because I think it is a good step forward [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=96.72s)]
*  and making these major changes are very welcome and I'm really delighted that the government's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  been listening. In Ellesmere Port on the Wirral Peninsula the original plan had left many deeply [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=105.28s)]
*  worried. Camille who has epilepsy gets PIP payments, her husband employment support allowance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  They're going on about getting rid of universal credit and cutting off PIP. We're going to struggle [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=117.68s)]
*  even more and it's sad because that is scary for me and as well as other families around Ellesmere [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=122.8s)]
*  Port we're all going to struggle. Jill is registered blind she says people fear losing help [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=129.52s)]
*  but change is needed. The welfare benefit system is very heavily used and spending huge amounts of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=136.08s)]
*  money which this country really can't afford and also there are a lot of people getting those [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  benefits that perhaps shouldn't be and it must be a terrible juggling act for people to try and stop [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  all the cheats, make sure that people with genuine need are getting the benefits that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=157.28s)]
*  they are entitled to. The conservatives say the government's U-turn and failure to get welfare [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  spending under control will come at a cost likely higher taxes. The Liberal Democrats that a grubby [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=168.24s)]
*  deal will still hurt disabled people. The government says its aim is to reduce the anxieties of those [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=174.64s)]
*  worried about the changes and put the benefit system on a sustainable footing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=181.04s)]
*  Damien Chromatikas BBC News Westminster. Well health and social care minister Stephen Kinnock [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=185.92s)]
*  said the process to a government climb down was a positive one. Well I think it's been a positive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  and constructive process where my colleagues from the back benches have engaged with ministers and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=196.48s)]
*  we now have a clear agreement that is going to really strike the right balance between ensuring [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  that we protect the most vulnerable in our society but also reform the fundamentally broken system [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  that we inherited from the conservatives. We are going to protect people who are now currently on [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  PIP and on the health element of universal credit and we've also got my colleague Stephen Thames the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  disability minister who is going to lead on a review of the system but what's vital is that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=230.4s)]
*  it's going to be co-produced with disabled people. Stephen will be working closely with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=236.88s)]
*  disabled people on the review and that will set out how we reform the system from November 2026 [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  onwards for people who are signing on to the system after that date. Health and social care [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=247.84s)]
*  minister Stephen Kinnock. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZaV1I_k4&t=253.12s)]
