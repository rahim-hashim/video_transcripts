Video Description: Pakistan has deported more than 19,500 Afghans this month, among more than 80,000 who have left ahead of a 30 April deadline, according to the UN.

Pakistan has accelerated its drive to expel undocumented Afghans and those who had temporary permission to stay, saying it can no longer cope.

Between 700 and 800 families are being deported daily, Taliban officials say, with up to two million people expected to follow in the coming months.

More than 3.5 million Afghans have been living in Pakistan, according to the UN's refugee agency, including about 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
