**BBC - The Latest:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo)
*  Have you heard this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's getting criticised in the media, and he says that he's helping, and he's not. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=1.28s)]
*  He's making us look bad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=6.28s)]
*  It claims to be a leaked recording of US Vice President JD Vance criticising Elon Musk. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=8.68s)]
*  Lots of people were quick to question whether it was AI generated or genuine, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=13.8s)]
*  and JD Vance himself has since said it's an AI generated fake. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=17.88s)]
*  Experts have suggested that the clip is likely to be inauthentic. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=21.92s)]
*  That means probably created by AI. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=25.64s)]
*  There are some telltale signs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=28.2s)]
*  The earliest posting we could find was from March 23rd [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  and came from a TikTok account that has posted other clips, memes and AI generated content [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=33.4s)]
*  highly critical of the Trump administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=38.28s)]
*  We can't say with full certainty that this was the original source, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=40.72s)]
*  but when questioning the authenticity of something, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=44.04s)]
*  you want to retrace the digital footprint and get as close to the source as possible to see if it's credible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=46.32s)]
*  That account holder has now deleted the audio. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=51.4s)]
*  Next, we sent the audio to forensic audio analysts. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=54.04s)]
*  They told us that the cadence and intonation are not consistent with Vice President Vance's typical speech patterns, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=57.4s)]
*  indicating that the clip is likely inauthentic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VlPyteyLNo&t=64.2s)]
