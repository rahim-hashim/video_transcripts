Video Description: Hundreds of Donald Trump supporters serving jail sentences for taking part in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 2021 have been freed, after the new President issued 1,500 pardons.

Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a riot following his false claims that the 2020 presidential election had been rigged against him.  Five people died, including a police officer and many more were injured. 

Trump's sweeping pardon went further than expected by including those convicted of violence and drew condemnation from police and US lawmakers including some of the president's fellow Republicans.   The blanket pardon effectively freed all the rioters and erased the work of the largest criminal investigation in US history.

Fourteen people convicted of some of the most serious crimes had their sentences commuted, meaning their offences will remain on the record but they will still be released from prison.

Leaders of the riots celebrated Mr Trumpâ€™s decision.  Among them were Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and self-proclaimed "QAnon shaman" Jake Angeli-Chansley.  They have long described the sentences handed out to people they call "J6 hostages" and "political prisoners" as being politically motivated and harsh.
