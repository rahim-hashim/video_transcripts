*  Police in Pakistan have arrested a 22-year-old man that they say has confessed to the murder [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=0.0s)]
*  of a teenage social media influencer Sana Yusuf. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=6.92s)]
*  Authorities say that they believe that Umar Hayat murdered Sana at her home in Islamabad [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  on Monday after having his offers of friendship rejected. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=16.48s)]
*  My colleague Azadeh Mashiri is across this story from Islamabad and Azadeh, just bring [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=21.96s)]
*  us up to date on this very difficult case. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=26.26s)]
*  Well Sana Yusuf was very well known here in Pakistan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=31.0s)]
*  At 17 years old she had hundreds of followers on Instagram and TikTok. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=35.84s)]
*  In fact, she was reaching nearly 1 million on TikTok. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=39.68s)]
*  Now what police have said is they believe that Umar Hayat had repeatedly tried to meet [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=42.92s)]
*  her and had those attempts rejected by Sana. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=48.28s)]
*  They say he then allegedly broke into her home in Islamabad on Monday, shot her twice, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  snatched her phone and then fled the scene. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=59.31999999999999s)]
*  We spoke to her father today who was at her burial in Chitral and he said that she had [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=62.63999999999999s)]
*  died at the scene and therefore it was too late to take her to the hospital. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=69.84s)]
*  He described Sana as very brave. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=75.72s)]
*  He said she'd never described any threatening behaviour prior to this taking place, that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=78.96s)]
*  he'd never even heard of Umar Hayat. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  And that instead he said his daughter was focused on eventually becoming a doctor one [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=88.36s)]
*  day. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=92.84s)]
*  Now what police have said is that there has been immense pressure as they put it for them [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=93.84s)]
*  to find the person who was responsible for Sana's death because of the fact not only [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=99.56s)]
*  that she was well known but as they put it this was a brutal killing of a teenage girl. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=105.08s)]
*  And given as you say Azadeh that she was so well known there's been a lot of reaction [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=111.36s)]
*  online. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=115.56s)]
*  There has been. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=119.36s)]
*  Her followers online have continued to grow and there have been floods and outpourings [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=120.36s)]
*  of condolences on her accounts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=127.6s)]
*  But as much as there has been outrage at the fact that a young woman, a young girl was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=130.8s)]
*  killed in her own home here in the capital city of Islamabad, there has also been some [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=136.24s)]
*  backlash to her work as an influencer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=142.4s)]
*  Pakistan is a conservative society and one of the digital monitors that I spoke to, an [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=146.08s)]
*  expert and one of the NGOs, said that a lot of this toxic discourse as he put it was coming [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=152.08s)]
*  from a small group of mostly male online users and that a lot of this is in his words misogynistic [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  patriarchal content trying to blame a victim here for her own murder. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=167.0s)]
*  I also spoke to a human rights expert and a very prominent activist here in Pakistan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=175.48s)]
*  who told me that she believed that this was just another case of a woman being extremely [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=181.2s)]
*  visible online of having her own voice and not only that being a young girl and that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=187.68s)]
*  therefore this triggered this sort of backlash that isn't uncommon here in Pakistan but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  what she saw as a very positive step was the fact that authorities and the police have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  very clearly condemned this killing and in fact the head of the police force here in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=204.72s)]
*  Islamabad said that they want to get the message out very clearly that girls and women who [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=209.24s)]
*  pursue any careers or hobbies as social media influencers should have the right to do so. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=216.32s)]
*  People here believe that that's a big step in the right direction but of course at the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=224.48s)]
*  end of the day this was a tragic killing that the country is still reacting to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=228.48s)]
*  Very very difficult situation. As a day as always thank you very much for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  covering this difficult case. Azadeh Mashiri, my colleague there, joining us live from Islamabad. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SMOPt5_J4&t=237.92s)]
