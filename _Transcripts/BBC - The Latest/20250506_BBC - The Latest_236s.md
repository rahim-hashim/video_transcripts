Video Description: Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt.
 
Merz had initially fallen six votes short of the absolute majority he needed on Tuesday morning - a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history.
 
As it was a secret ballot in the 630-seat Bundestag, there was no indication who had refused to back him - either MPs from his centre-left coalition partner or his own conservatives.
 
After hours of uncertainty in the Bundestag, the parties and the president of the Bundestag agreed to hold a second vote, which Merz then won with 325 votes, a majority of nine.

*  Welcome back. There is a new Chancellor in Germany in the last few minutes. Friedrich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Merz has been formally confirmed in his position, but it has not been straightforward for the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=9.46s)]
*  Conservative leader. He lost a confidence vote this morning. He was six votes short [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=15.44s)]
*  of the 316 vote majority that he needed. We are still to hear from Friedrich Merz. The [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=20.56s)]
*  result has only just been announced in the Bundestag. This was the second vote that was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=27.8s)]
*  arranged hurriedly this afternoon. Let's cross live to our correspondent in Berlin, Jess [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=32.32s)]
*  Parker. A sigh of relief all around, Jess. No doubt. Yes, so just happened, just broken [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=38.08s)]
*  here in the Bundestag. It looks like Friedrich Merz has made it through the second time around. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=47.16s)]
*  What a fascinating and chaotic day it has been to refresh people's memories. This morning [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=53.56s)]
*  we were expecting Friedrich Merz from the centre-right CDU party to be voted in without [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=59.2s)]
*  much fuss because he had a coalition, supposedly with the majority, and then the result came [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  through, bam, he hadn't made it through. He was six votes short of the majority. There [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  has been endless speculation as to how that happened. Which disgruntled MPs from within [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=72.84s)]
*  the coalition might have dissented. But then there was a lot of conversations going on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=78.36s)]
*  behind closed doors. They went for it a second time. It seems that whoever decided not to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=84.16s)]
*  support Friedrich Merz the first time around, well, a few people have changed their minds [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=88.88s)]
*  and he has made it through. A hugely embarrassing day for Friedrich Merz. He has been trying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=93.44s)]
*  to project strength and certainty, this antidote to the last divided government. This is not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=98.64s)]
*  how he wanted to start his term in power. I think it has made him look politically weak. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=105.48s)]
*  This was the first time a would-be Chancellor failed to secure a majority in 76 years of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=111.16s)]
*  the German Republic, Jess. It is not the ideal start, as you say. If he is now to form this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=116.76s)]
*  new Cabinet and take over, is he weakened by the loss of that first vote today? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=125.48s)]
*  Yes. As you say, it is not exactly how they wanted things to go today. Friedrich Merz was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=132.48s)]
*  supposed to have gone to see the President, come back to be sworn in. As you say, he was lined up [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=141.48s)]
*  with his Cabinet. Members of his Cabinet yesterday, I was there at an event here in Berlin, an old [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=146.48s)]
*  Gasworks building, signing the coalition deal from different members of the different parties to say [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=152.48s)]
*  that they had come to this agreement and it all looked like it was going to go very smoothly. I think [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=157.48s)]
*  a question now for Friedrich Merz. He has struggled to get through as Chancellor, despite having [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=163.48s)]
*  a narrow majority in Parliament with this coalition, but a majority nonetheless. Does this mean he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=169.48s)]
*  is going to struggle to get key, contentious legislation through this Parliament? There will also [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=175.48s)]
*  be the big question, as yet an answer, because it is a secret ballot here, who were these people who [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=181.48s)]
*  voted against him or did not vote for him? Were they members of his own Conservative CDU who do not like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=187.48s)]
*  his leadership style? Remember, this is a man who took three goes to become leader of his party. There [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=193.48s)]
*  have been lots of questions over his popularity within the party. Or were they figures from within the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=199.48s)]
*  party? Or were they dissatisfied with their leadership or the coalition agreement? We don't know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=205.48s)]
*  but it is an uncomfortable moment for the new Chancellor. He will hope to get back on track now. He is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=211.48s)]
*  supposed to be whizzing off to Paris and Warsaw tomorrow as part of a big tour to try and rebuild [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=217.48s)]
*  frayed ties as he sees it with important European partners. But Paris and Warsaw will have noticed what has [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=223.48s)]
*  happened. It is all pretty embarrassing for the new Chancellor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=229.48s)]
