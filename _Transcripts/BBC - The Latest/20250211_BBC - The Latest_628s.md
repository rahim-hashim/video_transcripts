Video Description: US President Donald Trump said if Hamas does not release all remaining hostages from Gaza by midday on Saturday, Israel should cancel the ceasefire and "let hell break out‚Äù.

Ahead of a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Trump suggested he may withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't co-operate with his plan to take control of Gaza and resettle the population in the two countries.
 
Hamas said it would delay the release of Israeli hostages until further notice, accusing Israel of breaching the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
 
Israel called the move a "complete violation" of the ceasefire deal, which began last month, and said its military was preparing at "the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza".

# Trump says Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled unless all Israeli hostages freed | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs)
*  President Trump says Israel should cancel the ceasefire deal and let all hell break out in Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=0.0s)]
*  if the remaining hostages aren't released by midday on Saturday. It comes after Hamas announced [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=5.92s)]
*  a delay to releasing the next group of Israeli hostages under further notice, until further [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=11.44s)]
*  notice rather, accusing Israel of breaking the ceasefire agreement. Hamas took 251 hostages [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=16.32s)]
*  when it attacked Israel on October the 7th, 2023. 73 of those hostages are still being held in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Since the ceasefire began in January, 16 Israeli hostages have been released. By the end of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=29.52s)]
*  first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages are expected to have been freed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=35.12s)]
*  Israel says eight of those 33 are dead. Let's just show you these live pictures from Gaza, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=41.04s)]
*  where Hamas accuses Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to the north of the strip, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=46.32s)]
*  firing on people and failing to allow in agreed humanitarian aid. These images that we've just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=51.84s)]
*  seen a short time ago do see aid being brought into the territory. Hamas officials say Donald [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  Trump has further complicated the Gaza truce. Here's President Trump speaking to reporters in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  the Oval Office. Well, I would say this, and I'm going to let that be because that's Israel's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=68.8s)]
*  decision, but as far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=74.0s)]
*  Saturday at 12 o'clock, I think it's an appropriate time, I would say cancel it and all bets are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  off and let hell break out. I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday, and if [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=87.36s)]
*  they're not returned, all of them, not in drips and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=93.76s)]
*  Saturday at 12 o'clock, and after that, I would say all hell is going to break out, and I don't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=103.76s)]
*  think they're going to do it. I think a lot of them are dead. I think a lot of the hostages are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=112.4s)]
*  dead. I think it's a great human tragedy what's happened, how people can be that mean to do. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=117.28s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it, but from myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=128.8s)]
*  and if they're not here, all hell is going to break out. Well, a short time ago, we've [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=135.52s)]
*  had some comments in reaction from the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=142.16s)]
*  we must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immediate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=146.32s)]
*  tragedy. So we've just had that reaction in from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urging [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=152.72s)]
*  Hamas to continue with the planned release of hostages. This comes after the Palestinian [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=158.32s)]
*  militant group announced its intention to halt the exchange. Let's get the latest with our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=163.2s)]
*  Middle East correspondent, Yuland Nel, who is in Jerusalem. Yuland, welcome to you. Some developments [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=167.44s)]
*  over the past few hours of reaction there from the UN and also Hamas reacting to Donald Trump's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=172.56s)]
*  comments. Bring us up to date. So what we're expecting imminently is a meeting of the Israeli [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=178.0s)]
*  Security Cabinet to discuss their next moves. This was already scheduled, but of course, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  the announcement yesterday by Hamas that it was going to hold up the next stage of the ceasefire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=192.08s)]
*  deal, the next scheduled release of hostages on Saturday, accusing Israel of a number of violations [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  of the ceasefire, which it denies. That has put these discussions by the Israeli Security Cabinet [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=207.36s)]
*  in a new light. We have families of the remaining Israeli hostages, some of them [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=214.4s)]
*  with supporters, at a protest close to where that meeting is taking place. And really, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=220.8s)]
*  this has heightened, of course, their anxiety about what should happen next, with President [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=228.24s)]
*  Trump's latest comments also just appearing to raise the stakes even more. The latest comments [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=233.84s)]
*  that we have had from Hamas really suggesting that there is room for mediators to step in in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=240.08s)]
*  the coming days in order to get the ceasefire as it's negotiated at the moment back on track. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  That's a statement that was put out this morning by Hamas. And also, we've had other comments from [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  them just suggesting that there is something strategically going on here as well. Because, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=263.2s)]
*  of course, President Trump's surprise announcement last week of a US takeover of Gaza [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=268.88s)]
*  in the future, when he's doubled down in recent days on his suggestions that Palestinians should [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=275.04s)]
*  be forced to leave the Gaza Strip, that is its two million residents, in order to develop it as a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=282.24s)]
*  sort of international travel destination. Hamas has said there is an agreement that must be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=289.28s)]
*  respected by both parties. This is the only way to bring back what it's calling prisoners. Of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=294.8s)]
*  course, it means Israel's hostages still in captivity. Yuland, this ceasefire was described [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=302.48s)]
*  as fragile from the very start, but it has proved almost smooth, hasn't it, over the past three [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  weeks with the odd hiccup. What's your sense of where we're at now with this ceasefire deal? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=314.48s)]
*  I mean, look, it has looked fragile since the beginning when it was first implemented on the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=320.88s)]
*  19th of January. Now it does look increasingly wobbly. Of course, one of the real concerns of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=328.88s)]
*  many Israelis, and there is, according to opinion polls, a desire among the Israeli public [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=336.08s)]
*  to push forward with the second stage of the ceasefire to bring home remaining hostages in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=342.4s)]
*  return for a more permanent end to fighting in Gaza. But there has been a concern that the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=348.32s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister, particularly since embracing President Trump's plan for Gaza, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=354.32s)]
*  for the future of Gaza, has wanted to keep open the door for a return to fighting. And we've got [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=361.28s)]
*  the Israeli military, they have been put on an increased state of alert. There's been leave [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=369.2s)]
*  postponed for combat soldiers in case of a return to the war in Gaza. As the UN Secretary-General was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=376.24s)]
*  saying, this would be devastating. Certainly, Palestinians who have been commenting on this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=385.2s)]
*  say there's already so much uncertainty about their lives. They're going back, in many cases, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  to the rubble of homes. Humanitarian conditions, extremely difficult, particularly given the stormy, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=396.48s)]
*  wintry weather that we've had in the past week. And people are saying that already [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=402.08s)]
*  it seems to be hell in Gaza. Okay, Yulanda, for now, thank you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=406.8s)]
*  President Trump has also warned he might withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they refuse to take [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=412.71999999999997s)]

*  The families in this camp came from Gaza, seeking temporary shelter after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=479.04s)]

*  Donald Trump's mentality is from the Middle Ages or the days of the Native Americans and how they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=516.4s)]
*  got rid of them. He deals with things like a real estate broker and he's an arrogant narcissist. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=521.28s)]
*  That's not how things are done. Jordan's government is treading a tightrope between [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=527.36s)]
*  its political ties to Israel and the US and its people's ties to the Palestinians. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFJV4vkXAs&t=532.8s)]
