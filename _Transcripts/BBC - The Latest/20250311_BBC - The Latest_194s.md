Video Description: Residents of Greenland are going to the polls in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future.

US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's independence.

Greenland has been controlled by Denmark for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen.

# What does Donald Trump have to do with Greenland's election? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w)
*  Well, President Trump is also affecting how people are feeling in Greenland right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=0.0s)]
*  So let's talk about today where they are voting in parliamentary elections. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=5.36s)]
*  It could have huge implications for Greenland's future. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  One of the central issues is whether the vast semi-autonomous Arctic territory pushes for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=11.84s)]
*  independence from its former colonial ruler Denmark. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Now normally politics on the remote Arctic island, only 57,000 people, wouldn't attract [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=19.64s)]
*  global attention. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=24.8s)]
*  We are focused on them because of what Mr Trump has had to say about Greenland. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=26.18s)]
*  His suggestions that the US aims to take over the territory has dramatically raised the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=30.26s)]
*  stakes, something he'd doubled down on in his speech to Congress last week, saying one [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=34.46s)]
*  way or the other, we're going to get it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=38.22s)]
*  Let's speak now to senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  Mikael Olsen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=44.5s)]
*  Mikael, good to see you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=45.5s)]
*  How much is independence the top issue for Greenlanders when they vote today? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=47.5s)]
*  Well, it's certainly one of the issues, but one shouldn't sort of overlook that in Greenland, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  as in most other democratic countries, there is a tendency that it's also foreign policy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=59.18s)]
*  only takes up that much room. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=66.7s)]
*  So the election is also about a host of other things like daycare and teachers and all this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=68.3s)]
*  kind of stuff, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  So independence certainly takes up a lot of room, but it's not everything. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=77.58s)]
*  Can you explain to us how things work in Greenland at the moment and how much influence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=82.7s)]
*  Denmark actually has over the territory? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=87.62s)]
*  Well, the division of labor, so to speak, would be that according to the Danish constitution, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=91.18s)]
*  Denmark would have the say in foreign and security policy, and then Greenland has the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=99.58s)]
*  option of taking home responsibility for a vast area of what makes a state work at its [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  own pace. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=112.34s)]
*  But even when it comes to foreign and security policy, we've seen a tendency in recent years, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  actually, for the Greenlanders to want more of a say and also for the Danish government [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=117.78s)]
*  to be willing to actually grant the Greenlanders and also the Faroese more of a say when it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  comes to Arctic policies, at least. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=129.78s)]
*  So Mikael, what has the reaction been from most Greenlanders, or is there a common feeling [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=131.66s)]
*  about what President Trump has had to say that for one way or another, it's going to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=137.02s)]
*  one day belong to the US? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=141.54s)]
*  Well, I think most reactions I've heard have been puzzlement, but also actually a lot of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=144.46s)]
*  people, a lot of Greenlanders are feeling insulted by this way of speaking about Greenland. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=152.42s)]
*  And this is a bit of a paradox in Donald Trump's strategy, because right now he seems to be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=158.02s)]
*  focusing quite a bit on trying to convince the Greenlanders to actively wanting to join [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=165.02s)]
*  the US. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=172.58s)]
*  But this project of trying to win hearts and minds in Greenland, it's not really working, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=173.58s)]
*  I got to say. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=179.9s)]
*  Rather, his remarks is having the opposite effect. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=181.9s)]
*  Mikael, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  It's an election that I think many people didn't realise they'd be following, but they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=188.62s)]
*  now are. Thank you so much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpnXzDaC_w&t=192.3s)]
