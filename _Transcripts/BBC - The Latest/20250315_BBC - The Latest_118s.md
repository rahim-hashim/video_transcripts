Video Description: Talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have failed to reach an agreement, a Palestinian official has told the BBC, as the US accused Hamas of making "entirely impractical" demands at meetings in Qatar.
 
Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March.
 
The US proposed to extend the first phase until mid-April, including a further exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
 
Israel is yet to comment.
