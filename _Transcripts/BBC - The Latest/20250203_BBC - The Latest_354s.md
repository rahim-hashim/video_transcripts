# Will smart glasses eventually replace smartphones? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE)
*  Smart glasses are often touted as the next step on from the smartphone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe we'll use them for calls and messages and all sorts of information could flash up [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=12.24s)]
*  before our eyes as sound is directed into our ears. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  And this year the CES show floor was awash with them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=23.18s)]
*  It feels early days. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=26.86s)]
*  But with some impressive functionality emerging, many a tech company seems to have their eye on the prize. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=29.62s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=35.94s)]
*  The Ray-Ban Metaglasses have been around for a few months. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=38.1s)]
*  I've got a pair for the sun here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=40.82s)]
*  They also come with clear lenses. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=42.1s)]
*  Their main aim being to create content. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=44.22s)]
*  So you've got cameras here that can film and microphones in them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=46.3s)]
*  They can also be used as audio sunglasses if you want to listen to music or if you want [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=50.2s)]
*  to have a chat with someone on the phone. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=54.5s)]
*  But new features are coming soon and they're all based around AI. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=56.34s)]
*  First off, it's time to translate a book from Spanish to English. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=59.78s)]
*  Hey Meta, translate this book. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=64.02000000000001s)]
*  No joy at first. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=66.22s)]
*  I wonder if it's because I keep looking at the camera. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=68.22s)]
*  Let's try again. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=70.62s)]
*  Hey Meta, translate this book. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=71.62s)]
*  It thinks it's a blank book. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  Holding it up in front of my face might just do it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=76.22s)]
*  Hey Meta, translate this book. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=78.86s)]
*  For a moment, the cameras are stuck on PETA's downturn gaze while everyone assimilates what [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=82.22s)]
*  he just said. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=86.78s)]
*  It's reading it like an audiobook. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=87.78s)]
*  It may have been a glitchy start, but this is great. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=88.78s)]
*  You can also just keep the AI function on for half an hour and do all sorts of things. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=93.42s)]
*  Hey Meta, tell me what's in front of me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  In front of me is a person, that's the admin filming, two chairs, some things on the table, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=103.02s)]
*  including some promotional material, which is a CES magazine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=110.1s)]
*  That was seriously impressive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  And the sound quality was absolutely amazing too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=117.34s)]
*  There are three to four hours battery life available on them, but the case also charges [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=120.58s)]
*  them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=125.62s)]
*  It can give you an extra three charges throughout the day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=126.62s)]
*  Halliday's glasses have a different focus. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=133.1s)]
*  I've actually got a screen in my field of view over there, which allows me to read words. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=135.82s)]
*  So it can translate, it can help me answer questions if I'm having a conversation, to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=141.42s)]
*  make me sound really clever, because it connects via your phone to the internet. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=145.58s)]
*  To control what function you're using, you can either swipe the side or through this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=149.7s)]
*  ring there's a little touch pad on the back, so you can scroll up and down. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=154.38s)]
*  Now I'm going to put it to the test with a spot of translation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=158.62s)]
*  You're going to speak in Mandarin and I'm hopefully going to see the words come up here [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=162.38s)]
*  in English. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=166.02s)]
*  It seems to be a bit behind and the screen keeps going off. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=169.02s)]
*  I'm talking to you in Chinese right now, can you hear what I'm saying? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=177.06s)]
*  I can not only hear it, I can understand it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  How's the battery life? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=182.34s)]
*  That will be a very long conversation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=187.34s)]
*  There were some challenges with internet connection and noise on the show floor, but [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=189.54s)]
*  even when the projected screen worked well, it never really felt comfortable to look at. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=193.7s)]
*  A proof of concept, yes, but a perfected experience, not quite. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=199.14s)]
*  Now most glasses are meant to aid your eyes, but how about your ears? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=204.54s)]
*  There are many people who could benefit from wearing a hearing aid, but they don't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=209.78s)]
*  Sometimes because they simply don't want it to show. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=214.06s)]
*  So how about an invisible solution that can be combined with a pair of glasses? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=216.98s)]
*  These are the Nuance Audio smart glasses, which also have speakers on the side, but [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=221.94s)]
*  this time to amplify all the sound around or boost people's voices. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=226.5s)]
*  The accompanying smartphone app allows you to choose the right settings for your environment. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=232.42s)]
*  Let me demonstrate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=236.7s)]
*  What did you have for breakfast this morning? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=237.7s)]
*  I've got some eggs and a cappuccino. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=239.94s)]
*  Now that sounded louder to me, whilst the background noise didn't and that's because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  there are directional microphones, so whatever I'm looking at is what I'm going to hear louder. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=246.34s)]
*  Now the sound quality is really clear. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  It can be a little bit tinny, but we are in quite a difficult environment here in the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  middle of the show floor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=260.94s)]
*  The fact is they do isolate the voice, they do make it louder and they do what they say [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=262.62s)]
*  on the tin. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=267.74s)]
*  Smart glasses can clearly provide an array of benefits, perhaps some you never even knew [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=270.34s)]
*  you wanted. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  Camelo's glasses are all about colour change. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  So this pair can be worn with lended or you can have a sunglass version and by just tapping [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  the side you change the colour of the glass. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  Pink, blue, orange, clear, so whatever the weather conditions are or whatever you're [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=289.62s)]
*  getting up to, you can make it appropriate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=294.06s)]
*  If you want something sportier though, then these are audio sunglasses. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  You can listen to music in them, you can also make phone calls, there's a microphone [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=302.1s)]
*  and speakers here just above the ears and you can adjust the brightness. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=306.86s)]
*  So if you're in bright light, you move it like this and the lenses become darker. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=311.86s)]
*  When things get a little bit darker, well there you go, you can see better. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=316.98s)]
*  As the early days of tech trends go, some of them seem impressively up to the job already, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=321.54s)]
*  whilst others feel like an early generation of an idea to be built upon. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAHeZLE_XE&t=327.1s)]
