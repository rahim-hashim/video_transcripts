# A North Korean mobile phone smuggled out the country showed the level of censorship #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo)
*  We've got hold of this phone that was smuggled out of North Korea last year [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=0.0s)]
*  and it shows some of the surprising lengths the regime is now going to to censor information. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=4.48s)]
*  North Korea blocks information from outside the country and these phones don't have access to the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=10.4s)]
*  internet. But South Korean TV shows are being smuggled over the border to try to show North [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=16.4s)]
*  Koreans how rich South Korea is and how much freedom people have here to try to undermine [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=21.92s)]
*  the regime. Now Kim Jong-un has banned these shows and from this phone you can see that he's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=27.68s)]
*  now also blocking people from using popular South Korean words. Look what happens when I type in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=33.36s)]
*  word oppa. This word literally means older brother in Korean but people here in South Korea now use [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  it as slang to refer to their boyfriends as well. When I enter it, it automatically [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=47.04s)]
*  changes to the word comrade and I get this warning it says this word can only be used to describe your [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=57.84s)]
*  siblings. Now look what happens if I type in the word the South Korea which is namhan. It automatically [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=64.56s)]
*  changes it to puppet state which is what the North calls the South. In this folder we can see that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  the phone is taking a screenshot every five minutes or so but the user can't open these files only the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=78.72s)]
*  authorities can so they can see when people are looking at or sharing things that they're not supposed to. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_VynSh2Fpo&t=85.6s)]
