Video Description: President Zelensky has said he’s ready to meet Vladimir Putin in Turkey this week for talks on ending the Ukraine War.  It’s proposed that they take place in Turkey on Thursday.

It came after President Trump demanded immediate direct talks between Ukraine and Russia to determine if a peace deal is possible.

Mr Zelensky had previously insisted that a full ceasefire must begin ahead of any negotiations.  Russia’s leader has refused to agree a ceasefire but has agreed to talks, although he’s not said if he will personally take part.

# Zelensky challenges Putin to meet this week after pressure from President Trump | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA)
*  President Zelensky has said he's ready to meet Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=0.0s)]
*  for talks on ending the Ukraine war. Mr Zelensky had previously said a full ceasefire should [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=5.68s)]
*  begin ahead of any talks, but after coming under pressure from Donald Trump, this evening [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=11.8s)]
*  he dropped that demand. Mr Trump insisted that talks should take place without delay [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  to determine whether a peace deal was possible. Mr Putin proposed the direct talks, the first [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  since 2022, but didn't specify whether he would attend from Kiev. Here's Frank Gardner. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=27.88s)]
*  It was all going so well for Ukraine. To Kiev there came leaders of some of Europe's most [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=35.24s)]
*  important countries with an ultimatum for Russia. Sign up to a ceasefire on Monday or [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=41.2s)]
*  face new sanctions. But Vladimir Putin has other ideas. Instead of a ceasefire, direct [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=46.84s)]
*  talks Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul next Thursday. But would President Trump insist [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=54.36s)]
*  on that ceasefire? President Putin of Russia doesn't want to have a ceasefire agreement [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=60.92s)]
*  with Ukraine, he wrote, but rather wants to meet on Thursday in Turkey to negotiate a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=65.88s)]
*  possible end to the bloodbath. Ukraine should agree to this immediately. I'm starting to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=70.68s)]
*  doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin. Have the meeting now. The last time Volodymyr [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=75.68s)]
*  Zelensky sat down with Vladimir Putin was in Paris six years ago. Yes, that's actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=81.36s)]
*  him on the left, a young man, before the strain of Russia's full-scale invasion. Tonight he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=86.98s)]
*  gave this address, complying with Mr Trump's wishes. I will be in Turkey this Thursday, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=93.26s)]
*  May 15th, and I will be waiting for Putin there, personally. And I hope that this time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  for reasons why he cannot do something. We are ready to talk to end the war. Thursday, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Turkey. President Trump has given his support. All leaders support this. In Kiev today, a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=112.46s)]
*  reminder of what no ceasefire means here. That's an air raid siren going off right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  so this war clearly isn't over yet. And it's not going to end anytime soon because both [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=126.22s)]
*  sides disagree profoundly on how to end it. Ukraine wants a ceasefire first, no more [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=131.82s)]
*  air raids like this. Russia wants talks first. That's what Mr Putin wanted, and that's what [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=137.9s)]
*  he's got, hot on the heels of his World War II victory parade in Moscow last Friday. A [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=146.9s)]
*  chance to air his grievances, his demands to demilitarise Ukraine, to deprive it of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=152.1s)]
*  the means to defend itself. The chances of a real breakthrough in Istanbul on Thursday [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=157.46s)]
*  are slim. So what will actually happen in Istanbul? Well, we know that President Zelensky [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  is going to go. He said so. He's thrown down the gauntlet for Vladimir Putin to meet him [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=171.22s)]
*  there. The problem is both sides are still incredibly far apart. Russia wants to bring [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=176.06s)]
*  Ukraine back into its orbit, and Ukraine wants to remain a sovereign, independent, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=182.44s)]
*  democratic country with close ties to the West. It's hard to see how they're going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=187.44s)]
*  to cover that ground. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzzHOBwwzBA&t=192.35999999999999s)]
