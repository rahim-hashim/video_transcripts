# Fuel switches cut off before Air India crash, preliminary report says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU)
*  We're just going to go back now to our breaking news and the fact that a preliminary report has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=0.0s)]
*  now been released from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau into the loss of the Air [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=7.44s)]
*  India flight a month ago. It was a Boeing Dreamliner. It crashed soon after taking off [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=12.72s)]
*  from Ahmedabad heading for London. I'm joined by our correspondent Archana Shukla in Mumbai. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=18.88s)]
*  Archana, tell us what we know is in this preliminary report. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=24.64s)]
*  Well, so far the preliminary report is a compilation of all the facts that has been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=30.48s)]
*  discovered so far in the investigation of the air crash that killed 260 people on June 12th. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=35.92s)]
*  As far as the data is concerned, there doesn't seem to be any mechanical issue with the 787 [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=45.28s)]
*  Dreamliner so far from the data that has been released and the investigations that have gone [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=53.36s)]
*  ahead. The report says that, you know, according to the flight data recorder, both the fuel control [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=59.44s)]
*  switches, now these are the switches that are while the plane is on ground, they are switched on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=66.48s)]
*  before it starts and they're only switched off when the plane lands and is in the bay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=72.56s)]
*  But the report says that both the fuel control switches, you know, were moved from the run [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  position to the cutoff position shortly after takeoff and that could have possibly caused the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  loss of thrust. We know that the aircraft took off and just a few seconds later lost thrust and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=93.44s)]
*  started sinking and then crashed. And this is a possible explanation to why that could have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=100.72s)]
*  happened. Although the report also says that just a few seconds later, both the engines, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=107.76s)]
*  one after the other, came back to the run off position, which means they were restarted, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=113.76s)]
*  but one of the engines could not reignite completely and that could have led to the crash. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=119.36s)]
*  These are, we must, you know, clarify that these are still preliminary findings. These are just some [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=126.0s)]
*  of the indications that the investigators have found from the flight data recorder and the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=131.92s)]
*  cockpit voice recorder, which has also recorded voices of the pilots discussing about this when [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=137.83999999999997s)]
*  one pilot says, why did you switch it off? And the other one says that I have not switched it off. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  So there was a communication on that part, but these are still very, very preliminary findings [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  on what could have caused the crash. And Archana, it's hard to underestimate really [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=155.27999999999997s)]
*  the shock that this caused this crash across India and indeed in the UK because this flight [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=161.44s)]
*  was heading here to London. It killed 241 of the 242 people on board. One British national [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=167.84s)]
*  managed to survive it. If pilot error is to blame, that is going to raise further questions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=175.6s)]
*  Obviously nothing definitive as yet, but that's what this preliminary finding, this preliminary [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=183.92s)]
*  report indicates. Obviously it's only just emerged. I don't know if there's been any response at all yet. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=189.44s)]
*  We cannot call it pilot error yet because that is not how it is listed. The preliminary report [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=197.68s)]
*  has only given a listing of how they have recorded the data that has been downloaded. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=204.16s)]
*  So I think it will be too, you know, quick for us to say that it was a pilot error [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=209.36s)]
*  immediately as of now. But yes, it indicates that it was the fuel switches that could have [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=216.55999999999997s)]
*  caused the loss of trust. And, you know, this investigation is also very complicated because [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=222.64s)]
*  this is one of the first crashes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is considered one of the most [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=227.76s)]
*  advanced planes and the safest of planes. And it did cause a lot of shock across the globe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=234.56s)]
*  in India and the UK and around the world. The plane was with a full fuel tank. So when the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=242.16s)]
*  crash happened, when the blast, when the aircraft blew apart, it really did char every single piece [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=248.56s)]
*  of that plane and the wreckage. And to, you know, get things out of the wreckage and to go through [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=256.8s)]
*  that data has also been a bit of a complicated struggle for the investigators here. Yes, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=262.88s)]
*  Archana Shukla, thank you very much indeed for that update on the report that's just been released, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=270.24s)]
*  the preliminary report into that crash. Let's try and understand a little bit more about those [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=275.76s)]
*  preliminary findings. We can speak now to David Gleave. He's aviation safety investigator. David, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=281.6s)]
*  thanks for joining us. And these are just preliminary findings. They're just coming into [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=286.72s)]
*  us. The report has just been made public. But this issue that both the fuel cutoff switches [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=290.72s)]
*  transitioned from run to cutoff one after the other with a time gap of just about one second. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=297.12s)]
*  Is that something that can happen automatically or does that take a human to physically do it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not ruling out the possibility of some software issue or an electrical arcing problem [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=310.56s)]
*  or something like that causing the signals to the relevant computers from sending that type of signal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=318.4s)]
*  The one second time gap is typically associated with how frequently the switch positions are [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=326.32s)]
*  sampled. So it could have been almost instantaneous. It could have been within, almost next to each [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=332.8s)]
*  other or within two seconds, depending on where within the one second sampling time they were [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=338.8s)]
*  switched. Or it could be some form of human deliberate act. So at the moment, a lot of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=343.52s)]
*  analysis will go in to say how could this have happened electrically or electronically [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=350.0s)]
*  as well as human intervention? We do have the finding though relating to the voice box recording [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  where one pilot asks the other, why did you switch that off? And the other says, I didn't switch it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=362.88s)]
*  off, which would suggest that it wasn't a human intervention there. How critical is that to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=368.32s)]
*  take off of a plane that those buttons are flicked on and off, whether it's by human or [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=376.64s)]
*  an electronic failure or a software issue? Well, essentially it's the same as the key switch in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=381.2s)]
*  your car. Switching the engines off is done directly through those particular buttons. So [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=388.64s)]
*  it's essential that when the signal that the engines receive is that they are to be kept on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=394.56s)]
*  Certainly the recycling of the buttons between from off to on again happens if you have a double [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=401.28s)]
*  engine failure with the procedures on board that aeroplane. So it's absolutely critical that the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=408.96s)]
*  switch remains and the sensors detect that the switch remains in that on position. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=414.08s)]
*  And the report seems to say that one of those engines managed to get itself going again and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=420.48s)]
*  recycle again, but that the acceleration was not sufficient to keep the aircraft in the air. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=426.16s)]
*  Was there any way that this aircraft could have recovered from what happened? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=433.12s)]
*  I don't think there was any way that it could have recovered because essentially once the engine [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  starts to wind down, it's a little like driving a car with a turbocharger. There's very little [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=444.0s)]
*  power at the bottom end when it starts to wind itself back up again and then [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=449.84s)]
*  as it builds power, suddenly more power becomes available. So the findings are consistent with [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=454.96s)]
*  what I would expect in terms of it taking a significant amount of time for the engine to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=461.11999999999995s)]
*  relight and build up power. The aeroplane should have been capable of flying with one engine on [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=466.4s)]
*  full power. So the good thing is that they've been able to eliminate certain other causes, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=471.84s)]
*  or at least strong indications that it wasn't multiple bird strike or water in the fuel, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  but it is very unusual for the engines to fail directly after the aeroplane has lifted off. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=484.88s)]
*  Now the Air Investigation Board says its investigation is continuing. These are just [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=492.08s)]
*  preliminary findings. Where would you expect that investigation to focus now? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=497.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're very much at the factual stage. This is what has been gathered and on we go from there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=504.08s)]
*  There will be different groups looking at the survivability of the aeroplane. How did somebody [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  get out and nobody else got out? There will be a big push on the psychological side to see why [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=515.28s)]
*  somebody could have made an error like this or whether one of the pilots was prone to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=523.28s)]
*  a deliberate malicious act like this. There will be engineering looking at how the switches could [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  possibly move themselves and they're designed not to move. You have to lift them as well as move [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=536.24s)]
*  them so you can't just knock them. And the electronics people will be looking at the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  software and possibly what could have corrupted any of the computers to send a false signal back [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=547.68s)]
*  saying please switch off the engines at this point in flight. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  Will there be anything for Boeing to look at from these preliminary findings that we have so far? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=558.8s)]
*  The aviation authorities have not released anything in terms of mandatory inspections [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=566.16s)]
*  or anything like that. So at the moment Boeing will be fed information through the National [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=571.84s)]
*  Transportation Safety Boards, the accredited representative to the accident and with no action [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=577.36s)]
*  coming out from them or from the Federal Aviation Administration there's nothing to indicate [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  something serious has happened that needs a worldwide grounding of the fleet or a direct [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  inspection in the next 24 hours before the next flight or anything like that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=595.84s)]
*  For people, civilians looking in at this and seeing these findings, is there anything that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=599.44s)]
*  should give anyone cause for concern getting on a Boeing flight today, tomorrow or any other time? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  I'd be quite happy getting on a 787 tomorrow. This doesn't worry me at all. It's a very well [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  designed aeroplane with a lot of safety systems and there's a lot of very good engineers and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  psychologists working on this case trying to work out as hard as they can to work out what the problem [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=623.12s)]
*  was in the first place and any potential cures. So the industry will learn very quickly from this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=629.2s)]
*  as and when there are any findings. And when you're going through David there, everything that still [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=634.48s)]
*  has to be looked at with the investigation team, what sort of timeline would you put on that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=639.6s)]
*  happening? I mean it sounds like it's still a massive task ahead. Yes, traditionally the reports [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  would be ready within a year. These days with some of the complexities it can take two, two and a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=651.76s)]
*  half years. But the real thing is to separate out the recommendations to industry and these are [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=656.8s)]
*  released as soon as possible for immediate action rather than waiting for the full report that the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=663.52s)]
*  relatives want to read to understand. So we need to separate out those two pieces from each other. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  But the main report could take a couple of years by the time that everybody's had their comment and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=674.64s)]
*  had the time that's necessary to do the analysis. But if any changes are needed to procedures or [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=680.4799999999999s)]
*  software or anything like that, would those happen before the final report is there? Yes, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=687.36s)]
*  certainly. As soon as the accident investigators are ready to release any recommendation, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=693.6s)]
*  we'll go straight out to industry. The regulators will take action, the airlines and the manufacturers [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  will take action at that point. And you will see that in some of the reports that are out there [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=706.72s)]
*  where they said, we don't need to release a recommendation at the end of the report. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=712.24s)]
*  We've already done this part way through the report and the industry has responded. So [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=716.48s)]
*  an immediate response will come from industry. Okay, all right, David Leve, Aviation Safety [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Investigator. Thank you very much for helping us parse through those preliminary findings of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  this report into the Air India accident. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vImFyw9CiCU&t=734.56s)]
