# Is Iran close to having nuclear weapons? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE)
*  Israel says its attacks on Iran are necessary to stop what it calls imminent production of a nuclear weapon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=0.0s)]
*  But Tehran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=7.7s)]
*  Well our analysis editor Roz Adkins along with the team at BBC verify [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=12.66s)]
*  Have taken a look at what we know about Iran's nuclear program [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's warnings about Iran go back a long way [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=23.76s)]
*  Time is running out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  They hope we'll reach the eastern seaboard of the United States within 15 years [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  Weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  Last week there was a similar message [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=41.0s)]
*  Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  It could be a year, it could be within a few months, less than a year [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=47.0s)]
*  But there are questions about whether that's the case [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=50.68s)]
*  Israel says it's targeted two of Iran's nuclear facilities, Natanz and Isfahan [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=54.28s)]
*  It hasn't said if it's targeted another called Fordo [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=59.08s)]
*  And Iran acknowledges that Fordo and Natanz produce enriched uranium [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=62.36s)]
*  Which can be used in power plants and nuclear weapons [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=66.68s)]
*  Iran though says its nuclear program is peaceful [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=70.12s)]
*  On this the global nuclear watchdog has raised concerns [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=73.24s)]
*  About the growth of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  And it says it can't verify Iran's intentions are entirely peaceful [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  Because of a lack of cooperation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=85.0s)]
*  But it found no proof of a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=87.24s)]
*  Or there's the US [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  In March its director of national intelligence said [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=93.64s)]
*  The US continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  But on that President Trump has now said this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=101.08s)]
*  I don't care what she said, I think they were very close to having it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  He gave no evidence to support that claim [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=107.56s)]
*  And all of this follows the 2015 nuclear deal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=110.28s)]
*  Between Iran and the US, the UK and others [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=113.8s)]
*  In return for sanctions relief [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=117.08s)]
*  Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium to civilian purposes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=118.68s)]
*  But in 2018 President Trump pulled the US out of the deal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=122.92s)]
*  Calling it disastrous [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=126.28s)]
*  US sanctions returned [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=128.12s)]
*  And Iran, which had stuck to the terms of the deal, began to breach them [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=129.56s)]
*  And that's continued [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=134.12s)]
*  Since then Iran has significantly increased [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=135.4s)]
*  The number of centrifuges it operates to enrich uranium [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=139.0s)]
*  It has significantly increased its stockpiles of uranium [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=141.88s)]
*  For its part, Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=145.64s)]
*  Though it refuses to confirm or deny this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=148.44s)]
*  And hasn't signed the UN nuclear non-proliferation treaty [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=150.44s)]
*  And as we watch this conflict [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=154.12s)]
*  We know of Iran's threats and hostility towards Israel [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=156.12s)]
*  That it doesn't recognise its right to exist [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=159.4s)]
*  And we know Israel wants regime change in Iran [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=162.2s)]
*  But Israel's justification for these attacks [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=165.72s)]
*  Is that it faces an imminent and existential threat [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=168.12s)]
*  From Iran's nuclear programme [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=171.16s)]
*  So far that doesn't match publicly available evidence or expert assessments [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcvKJGRHKE&t=173.56s)]
