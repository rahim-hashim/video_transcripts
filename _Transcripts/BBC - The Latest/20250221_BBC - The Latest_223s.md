*  A 27-year-old man who stabbed the novelist, Sir Salman Rushdie, in New York in 2022 has been found guilty of attempted murder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=0.0s)]
*  The attack left the writer blind in his right eye. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=9.44s)]
*  Let's get the very latest on that with our North America correspondent, Nomiya Iqbal, who joins me now and has been following the trial. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Nomiya, just bring us up to date. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=20.16s)]
*  This attack happened in 2022. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=21.44s)]
*  Sir Salman Rushdie was at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=27.520000000000003s)]
*  He was on stage giving a talk about how to keep writers safe. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  27-year-old Hadi Muttah was in the audience. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=36.24s)]
*  He had purchased a ticket to go to the event. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=39.52s)]
*  He rushed onto stage and attacked Mr Rushdie multiple times. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=41.68000000000001s)]
*  The author had to be airlifted to hospital. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=46.0s)]
*  It took him weeks to recover and he chronicled the incident in his latest book. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=49.04s)]
*  In terms of this trial, it took less than two weeks and less than two hours for the jury to come back with their verdict. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  I was in court when Sir Salman himself took to the stand and he went into vivid description of what happened that day and he removed his glasses to show the jury how he lost his eye. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  This was never a case of who done it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=75.12s)]
*  This incident had been witnessed by many people in the audience. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=78.24s)]
*  They gave evidence at the trial. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=81.68s)]
*  It was also live streamed, the event, so people saw it online. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=83.68s)]
*  The prosecution's case was quite clear cut. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=88.08s)]
*  The defence had argued that the prosecution hadn't proven the intent, that Hadi Muttah had gone to the event and that this was more of a chaotic incident, not a premeditated attack. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=91.52s)]
*  That was rejected by the jury. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=106.56s)]
*  It took less than two hours to come back with their verdict. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=108.56s)]
*  Muttah will be sentenced as a later date. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=112.56s)]
*  He is facing up to 32 years in jail. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=115.84s)]
*  You were saying that you were there when Sir Salman took to the stand. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=118.4s)]
*  He really vividly described the attack on him and also how those injuries he is still living with. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  He lost one eye. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=130.32s)]
*  He has also lost the movement in a hand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=132.32s)]
*  He suffered multiple organ damage. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=136.32s)]
*  He even said during the evidence that he gave that he thought he was going to die. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=138.32s)]
*  In his book he also talked about that incident. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=144.32s)]
*  Just the back story of Mr Rushdie, which many people might know or others might not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=146.32s)]
*  He lived in fear for nearly a decade after a fatwa was issued against him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=152.32s)]
*  This was after his book came out, Satanic Verses, in which he was accused of insulting Islam and the prophet Mohammed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=157.2s)]
*  He had said even two weeks before the attack that he wanted to live a relatively normal life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=165.2s)]
*  That he didn't want to have security around him all the time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=171.2s)]
*  Then this incident two weeks later happened. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=175.2s)]
*  He talked about how he had always feared that this potentially could have happened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=177.2s)]
*  I want to add that Hadi Muttah has never talked about his motivation of exactly why he attacked Mr Rushdie. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Also to mention that he is facing a separate federal case. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  This involves terrorism charges where Mr Muttah is accused of providing material support and resources [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from September 2020. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  In an attempt to carry out that fatwa that was issued in 1989. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=206.96s)]
*  Mr Muttah has denied those charges. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=212.96s)]
*  Thank you very much for bringing us up to date. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMc3M6QBb8&t=216.96s)]
