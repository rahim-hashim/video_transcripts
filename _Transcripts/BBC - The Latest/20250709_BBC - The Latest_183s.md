Video Description: Ten years ago, the arrest of hundreds of Chinese human rights lawyers began in a nationwide crackdown, known as the 709 incident. 
 
At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to surveillance, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.
 
The lawyers have long been a target of China's communist party. One of those lawyers was Wang Quanzhang, who was detained for more than four years. 
 
A decade later, he still faces daily harassment on the streets of Beijing.
