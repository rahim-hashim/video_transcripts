# Russia launches largest air attack yet on Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM)
*  Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine with the highest number of drones and missiles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=0.0s)]
*  launched in a single night yet. At one point the whole of Ukraine was under an air alert [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=4.48s)]
*  as missiles were fired from the Black Sea and strategic bombers in Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=9.68s)]
*  Officials in the Ukrainian capital said around a dozen enemy drones had reached Kiev's airspace, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=14.24s)]
*  which forced thousands to take shelter in metro stations and basements. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=19.36s)]
*  It comes as the biggest prisoner of war exchange so far between Russia and Ukraine is now complete. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=23.76s)]
*  These are the latest pictures we've received from Ukraine's capital. 12 people are reported [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=30.96s)]
*  to have been killed in Kiev. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that America's silence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=35.6s)]
*  and the silence of others in the world only encourages Volodymyr Putin. Our correspondent [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=40.96s)]
*  in Kiev, James Waterhouse, says the impact of the overnight strikes are far-reaching. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=46.8s)]
*  This was a night where according to Ukraine's air force you've got more than 360 missiles and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=52.24s)]
*  drones. That is the highest number yet since Russia started launching these huge air assaults [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=57.68s)]
*  in late 2022. In the time since, Moscow has been able to manufacture these drones at a far much [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=65.44s)]
*  faster rate. There's also an arms race when it comes to drones between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=74.4s)]
*  Both are being fitted with more sophisticated technology and packed with more explosives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=80.24s)]
*  I think that is now translating into the case of this weekend for cities like Kiev. 48 hours [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=85.52s)]
*  of pretty sustained bombardment. Last night the sirens went at midnight and there were explosions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  right all the way through until sunrise. The skies were lit up with search lights and you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=97.6s)]
*  could hear air defences going off, you could see the occasional drone intercepted, you could hear their [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=104.08s)]
*  motors and several regions in central northern southern Ukraine were targeted in this way [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=109.28s)]
*  and that is why President Zelensky is again urging his allies to put more pressure on Russia [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=116.4s)]
*  to not just stop fighting, stop these aerial assaults but also to engage in a ceasefire. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=121.76s)]
*  But at the moment his calls are falling on deaf ears. James Waterhouse. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp39Rjj6CVM&t=127.44s)]
