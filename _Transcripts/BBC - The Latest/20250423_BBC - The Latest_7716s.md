# LIVE: Pope Francis's coffin moved to St Peter's Basilica for public mourning | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8)
*  As we watch Catherine the Pope moving slowly through the basilica he loved so dearly, Catholics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=0.0s)]
*  around the world in mourning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=24.56s)]
*  According to martyrdom for the Catholic Church you were just talking to Austen there about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=54.56s)]
*  the Litany of the Saints and many of the names of those saints are the very first saints [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=59.84s)]
*  and martyrs of the Church. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  People like Priscilla Perpetua, Cosmas Danium and the journey went through the Square of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=70.0s)]
*  the Proto Martyrs that was built over where the circus of the Emperor Nero had been where [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=77.6s)]
*  so many early Christians were put to death. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  Just behind the procession was the obelisk in the centre of St Peter's Square. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=89.28s)]
*  That used to stand, it was brought from Egypt and it used to stand in that circus where [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  they put the martyrs to death. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=99.32s)]
*  And now we are seeing the carnals in their red, the symbol of martyrdom, of the blood [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  of martyrs and while Pope Francis was not a martyr he was a man like all Christians [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  born to sacrifice their life for Christ and that sacrifice for him meant leaving his native [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Argentina to which he never returned and devoting his life to leading the Church. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=129.96s)]
*  And this liturgy, quite a lot of it will refer to him as it would for any Christian to being [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=138.84s)]
*  a servant, serving the Lord and I'm sure Catholics around the world would be praying that Pope [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=148.28s)]
*  Francis now has the heavenly reward for that life of sacrifice and service. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=159.64s)]

*  Amen. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2058.48s)]
*  You're watching BBC News, broadcasting live from the Vatican. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2060.48s)]
*  Over the last moments, we have been mesmerised by the beauty and the sanctity of the liturgy that we've heard and seen for Pope Francis. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2069.48s)]
*  Here at the glorious St Peter's Basilica. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2083.48s)]
*  We heard the invocation of the saints, we heard a prayer for St Francis, for Pope Francis, and for the patron saints. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2091.48s)]
*  I'm joined here by Austin Ivory, Pope Francis' biographer, who was with me watching and listening to that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2108.48s)]
*  Tell us, Austin, a little bit more about the significance of what we've just seen. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2119.48s)]
*  Well, this is a moment, as I was saying earlier, which is part of the process of coming to terms with the passing of Pope Francis. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2127.48s)]
*  It's a moment where, of course, the Cardinals brought him in so that the body can be put on display, so there's a line in state, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2135.48s)]
*  so the faithful can now, over the next days until the funeral on Saturday, come and pay their respects, and absolutely anybody can come and do that. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2146.48s)]
*  Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the chamberlain, the one who's leading the process of this vacancy, as it's called, concluded that [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2155.48s)]
*  it was a very simple liturgy, in fact not really very dissimilar from any other kind of line in state, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2164.48s)]
*  but with particular prayers for the late Pope Francis that the chief shepherd who eternally lives to intercede for us may welcome him into his kingdom of light and peace. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2170.48s)]
*  And then prayers for the church, prayers for every people and nation that in the pursuit of justice they may dwell in peace as one family united by affection. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2180.48s)]
*  And so it's a moment of prayer, it was a moment, a solemn moment, where Pope Francis' body is put on display and the people of God led by the pastors pray, simply pray. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2189.48s)]
*  So a time now of prayer of the next two days, of recollection, of giving thanks for everything that the Pope has meant to the Catholic Church and to the whole of humanity. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2202.48s)]
*  This was a Pope who reached out beyond the boundaries, all the boundaries that exist, he reached an extraordinary capacity to reach beyond them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2214.48s)]
*  So I would say a global moment of prayer and recollection, and one that I think is very, very important in this process. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2221.48s)]
*  Austin, thank you. And if I could bring in at this moment Catherine Pepinster, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2229.48s)]
*  a religious commentator and former editor of the Catholic News Weekly, The Tablet. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2236.48s)]
*  Catherine, you too were watching that ceremony and now as the ceremony comes to an end, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2242.48s)]
*  the Pope's body will lie in state where it is now and people will begin to file past it to pay their respects. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2252.48s)]
*  Yes, that's right, Mariam. One thing that I find very noticeable about this moment, very moving moment, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2266.48s)]
*  the Cardinals are beginning the process of people paying their respects. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2275.48s)]
*  But the Pope's body is lying before the high altar in St Peter's and that is built above what Catholics believe is the tomb of Peter, the first apostle and the first Pope. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2280.48s)]
*  So there's that symbolism there of taking us back to Christ and his first followers. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2298.48s)]
*  And now we pay our respects to the leader of Catholics until just the other day. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2306.48s)]
*  The other thing that strikes me is that one of the prayers said and was sung during that service in Latin was the Lord's Prayer, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2316.48s)]
*  the prayer that all Christians know so well and amongst the words of course of that prayer are the words, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2326.48s)]
*  forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2335.48s)]
*  And that reminds me of Pope Francis because Pope Francis spoke so much about forgiveness and talked so much about God's mercy. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2339.48s)]
*  He urged people to turn to God, to the merciful God. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2349.48s)]
*  And so I thought those words were particularly poignant today. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2353.48s)]
*  The ceremony is now over. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2379.48s)]
*  The Pope will remain where he is. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2398.48s)]
*  And as we watch the Cardinals file past his coffin, I from where I'm standing [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2405.48s)]
*  I can see crowds of people starting to move away from the seated area from which they watched the procession and to join the queue. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2415.48s)]
*  And I can tell you from where I'm standing, the queue is already long and dense, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2428.48s)]
*  filled with people waiting to be allowed their chance, their opportunity to file past the body of the Pope, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2434.48s)]
*  to see him for a final time and to pay their respects. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2446.48s)]
*  But in this moment, it is those inside the Basilica who are doing just that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2453.48s)]
*  The sign of the cross made in front of the Pope as the Swiss guards watch on. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2482.48s)]
*  The bishops move one by one. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2491.48s)]
*  And as we watch these pictures, let us bring in my colleague Mark Lowen, who is in St. Peter's Square. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2500.48s)]
*  Mark, it was an absolutely incredible moment. I'm sure you were there when the Pope first entered the Square and the applause rang out. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2511.48s)]
*  The applause of so many hundreds, perhaps even thousands of worshippers who have come here to say their goodbyes. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2522.48s)]
*  Indeed, Mariam, the Square has been very full today, with people waiting at the barriers here to try to catch a glimpse on big screens by the Basilica [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2533.48s)]
*  as the body of Pope Francis was taken in to the Basilica in that open casket to be placed before the altar of the Confession, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2544.48s)]
*  which of course is covered by that beautiful bronze balderkin designed by the Baroque artist Bernini beneath Michelangelo's dome. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2554.48s)]
*  And they are expecting tens of thousands of people between now and Saturday to file into St. Peter's Basilica to catch a final glimpse of Pope Francis, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2565.48s)]
*  who has been temporarily embalmed. He is wearing his red robes and mitre and holding rosary beads in his coffin before that funeral on Saturday morning. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2578.48s)]
*  The Basilica will be open until midnight today and tomorrow. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2591.48s)]
*  And then on Friday, it will close at 7 p.m. before the funeral takes place on Saturday morning, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2597.48s)]
*  and then the funeral will be attended by heads of state, royalty and world leaders from right across the globe. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2605.48s)]
*  Well, among those on the Square here planning to go inside the Basilica over the next couple of days, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2612.48s)]
*  I've just met Margo from France, who actually lives here in Rome, very close to here and runs a restaurant very close to St. Peter's Square. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2619.48s)]
*  Margo, very nice to talk to you. Just give us a sense of your reaction when you got the news a couple of days ago, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2627.48s)]
*  first of all, of the Pope's passing. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2634.48s)]
*  I guess I was really surprised and emotional. We heard the news Monday morning, around 10, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2636.48s)]
*  and the day before he was there in St. Peter's Square for Pasqua. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2643.48s)]
*  It was a bit of a shock, but we are really glad to be here and to be able to come gather here today. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2648.48s)]
*  We'll go tonight to see him inside the Basilica and we'll be definitely here on Saturday morning. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2655.48s)]
*  What has it been like for you over the last couple of days? You know this area so well. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2661.48s)]
*  Your restaurant, I gather, is just very close to St. Peter's Square. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2665.48s)]
*  I mean, you've seen already tens of thousands of people, pilgrims, faithful tourists coming here, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2668.48s)]
*  and it's only going to grow over the next few days. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2674.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because we live right there, so we come here very often, and we come at night. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2676.48s)]
*  Piazza is totally empty, and now it's weird seeing this big event happening here. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2683.48s)]
*  And it's been a bit moving, I guess. Like Italians, they're a bit sad. It's powerful to live this. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2690.48s)]
*  What was it about Pope Francis that you liked? I gather you're Catholic and you are faithful as well. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2701.48s)]
*  What did he mean to you? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2709.48s)]
*  Hope, I guess. And also it's the Jubilee of hope, speranza, this year. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2712.48s)]
*  The Jubilee year of the Catholic Church. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2717.48s)]
*  And he was joyful, I guess. I saw him a couple of times here with a beautiful smile, a message of love also. I really liked him. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2720.48s)]
*  And in terms of his views, his social views, the kind of softening, his more moderate and progressive views on social issues, was that important to you? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2731.48s)]
*  For me, yeah, very important. And I hope that the next Pope will follow him, follow his path. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2740.48s)]
*  Because that is a big question, isn't it? Because 80% of the cardinals who will be choosing his successor were appointed by him. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2745.48s)]
*  So one would have thought that that would mean that that would translate into a Pope who would sort of follow his trajectory, let's say. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2755.48s)]
*  But it's not guaranteed, is it? I mean, there is a more conservative wing to the Church. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2763.48s)]
*  And would you be worried if it swung back in that direction? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2767.48s)]
*  Of course, I am worried. I'm worried. I'm really looking forward to what's going to happen in the next week. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2770.48s)]
*  I hope it's going to be just like him, following his ideas. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2776.48s)]
*  What is it like, Margot, living here? Because the Vatican has a kind of an aura around it, doesn't it? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2780.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2787.48s)]
*  Something that's slightly mysterious. People don't know much about the Vatican unless they really do know about it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2788.48s)]
*  Just give us an insight into, you know, when you walk through here at night and you see the colonnades, you see the angel, you see the dome of Michelangelo, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2795.48s)]
*  you see the priests and the nuns on a daily basis. Just paint the picture of what it's like living here. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2803.48s)]
*  It's kind of mysterious and at the same time it's really part of our life. It's our everyday work here to go to the markets. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2809.48s)]
*  So at some point it's really about religion and at some point it's just part of your life and you work here and you see tourists and then you see priests. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2815.48s)]
*  And then you see the Pope and it's really mixed up. And it's kind of mystical at night when it's totally empty. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2824.48s)]
*  It's beautiful. I like living right there. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2832.48s)]
*  Did you used to watch his weekly angelus prayer or the Sunday blessing, for example? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2836.48s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes we got here. But also for Easter we got here, of course, for bigger events. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2843.48s)]
*  And on Wednesday also, because every Wednesday he came here. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2851.48s)]
*  Angelus prayer. Were you here actually for his Easter Sunday blessing, his last public appearance? Were you here? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2855.48s)]
*  No, unfortunately I was in Tuscana so I didn't see him for the last time on Sunday. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2860.48s)]
*  I'm sure you saw those images. Did you feel that he looked frail? Did you get a sense that he was coming towards the end? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2865.48s)]
*  He did look tired but he got out of the hospital so I guess we hoped that he would live all the jubilee year. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2873.48s)]
*  So no, I didn't expect this on Monday morning. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2882.48s)]
*  And what kind of a hole has he left for you, for your friends and family? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2885.48s)]
*  I guess it's a new page that's going to turn. We'll see who's the next Pope. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2892.48s)]
*  A bit of sadness now. We'll see what's next. But we're going to pray for him definitely in the next days. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2899.48s)]
*  And this morning's ceremony was beautiful. I was just right there, I saw him. Beautiful, very moving. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2905.48s)]
*  Margot, lovely to talk to you. Thank you very much and enjoy your life in this magnificent place. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2911.48s)]
*  Margot is saying she will pray for him and that's absolutely what the Pope asked for at the end of every service. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2916.48s)]
*  I've spoken to so many people in the last few days who met him and from all walks of life and they often said [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2922.48s)]
*  at the end of their meeting with him he would always say pray for me and they felt that that connected them even more with the Pope. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2927.48s)]
*  So now three days of lying in states, the funeral on Saturday and then we are expecting that conclave, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2935.48s)]
*  that elaborate ornate process, often a very secretive process to choose the next Pope would begin the week of the 5th of May. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2941.48s)]
*  We will know for sure in the coming days when the start of that conclave will begin. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2948.48s)]
*  Mariam, back up to you on the rooftop above me. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2953.48s)]
*  Mark, thank you so much and we are still watching these pictures of priests and clergy paying their respects to Pope Francis. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2957.48s)]
*  And if I could bring in Austin Ivory, the Pope's biographer, you knew him, you met him on numerous occasions, Austin. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2969.48s)]
*  And you saw him also in death yesterday at the Chapel of St. Marcia. Talk me through your feelings at this moment. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2979.48s)]
*  Well what I find beautiful about this moment is I'm looking down at the square and the people of course are filing in. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2986.48s)]
*  There's this wonderful moment now where the people, it's the ordinary faithful people, we've had a day or two of the people who work in the Vatican paying their respects. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2992.48s)]
*  But now this is just ordinary people coming to pay their respects, to give back some of the love that they've had from him over the years. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3003.48s)]
*  And I know that's certainly how I feel today. I feel I've received so much from him as his biographer, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3010.48s)]
*  somebody who's tried to understand him and who has shown me in many ways how to be Christian in the 21st century, how to love. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3016.48s)]
*  And I think many of the people who are going in there now and are going to be filing past their body, they'll be feeling exactly that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3022.48s)]
*  They'll feel that he was there for them. And this is their moment to say thank you. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3028.48s)]
*  And what I also love about this moment is that he is raised facing the people and it is the ordinary people now coming back to him. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3034.48s)]
*  This is a pope of the people now again in his death with the people. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3041.48s)]
*  Austin, such powerful words and I'm sure feelings echoed amongst Catholics around the world. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3047.48s)]
*  And we'll leave you now from the Vatican with these pictures of Pope Francis as he lies in rest. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3057.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3076.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3106.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3136.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3166.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3196.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3226.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3256.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3286.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3316.48s)]
*  Hello, welcome to the program. I'm Lewis Vaughan Jones. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3347.48s)]
*  We're going to head straight to the Vatican to Rome and we can have these live pictures. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3350.48s)]
*  We have a couple of live feeds of pictures coming to us from the Vatican. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3355.48s)]
*  We'll show you these first of St. Peter's Square there, St. Peter's Basilica in the background. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3359.48s)]
*  We have just come to the end of the transportation of Pope McLaughlin from his resting place in his residence [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3366.48s)]
*  through the square there that we can see and is now lying in state inside St. Peter's Basilica [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3374.48s)]
*  after the formal ceremony has just finished in the last 10 minutes, 15 minutes or so. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3383.48s)]
*  What we are expecting next is for many of the people there that we can see on the screen sitting and standing in the sloughed in [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3391.48s)]
*  to start filing past to pay their respects to Pope Francis. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3398.48s)]
*  He will be there now for the rest of the day up until Saturday, the funeral. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3403.48s)]
*  These are pictures now from just a little earlier. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3409.48s)]
*  These are the Swiss guards there accompanying the body of Pope Francis in that open coffin. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3412.48s)]
*  This was the ceremonial part that took place just in the last couple of hours this morning, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3419.48s)]
*  being moved from his place of residence, which is just behind St. Peter's Basilica, just behind St. Peter's Square effectively, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3426.48s)]
*  and was carried there accompanied by the Swiss guards as we just saw, but also cardinals in the red, the bishops in the purple. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3435.48s)]
*  There was this procession through up into inside St. Peter's Basilica as we can see there. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3446.48s)]
*  And that is where the body of Pope Francis will now stay for the days ahead, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3454.48s)]
*  as people will be allowed in and allowed to file past and pay their final respects. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3460.48s)]
*  Well, there are plenty of people in St. Peter's Square as we just saw in those live images, and our correspondent Mark Glowen is also there. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3467.48s)]
*  Mark, what's been happening there? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3475.48s)]
*  Hi, Lewis. Yes, well, it's been a busy square. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3478.48s)]
*  Thousands of people have been waiting by the barrier to catch a glimpse of the basilica behind me [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3481.48s)]
*  and the procession into the main door of the basilica with the coffin of Pope Francis, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3487.48s)]
*  which is now lying before the altar of the Confession inside the basilica, under which is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3494.48s)]
*  Remember, each pope is elected to be the successor to St. Peter, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3504.48s)]
*  and that is where the open coffin of Pope Francis will lie now until Saturday morning when the funeral begins. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3509.48s)]
*  And they are expecting tens of thousands of people every day to go into the basilica until midnight every day, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3518.48s)]
*  until Friday evening at 7pm when the basilica will be closed before that funeral on Saturday, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3524.48s)]
*  a funeral which is going to attract heads of states and world leaders from right across the globe. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3530.48s)]
*  And then, of course, Pope Francis will be buried on the other side of Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3537.48s)]
*  It is more than a century since a pope was buried outside the Vatican, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3543.48s)]
*  and that is very much a sign of how Pope Francis wanted a more humble, more simple end to his life. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3549.48s)]
*  Well, two of those who are hoping to go inside the basilica to catch a final glimpse of the pope are Craig and Paula, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3557.48s)]
*  who are over from Australia, and they were here on holiday and then saw the news, heard the news that the pope had died. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3564.48s)]
*  Craig, just give me a sense of your reaction when you heard that news. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3573.48s)]
*  Well, we weren't surprised, I have to say, because we knew he had been very ill, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3577.48s)]
*  but we were here on the Sunday service when he spent some time on the balcony, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3583.48s)]
*  and we have it staying in a hotel only a few metres away, and we heard the bells ring at 7.35 in the morning, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3587.48s)]
*  we thought that was a little odd, and then we looked on the news and we found out that he had passed away overnight, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3593.48s)]
*  which was very ironic or bizarre in a way, because we'd only just seen him the night before on the balcony, and he seemed okay. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3597.48s)]
*  Very much. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3605.48s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3606.48s)]
*  Yeah, very much, but to learn that he died of a secondary illness rather than pneumonia, really was interesting, but not surprising. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3607.48s)]
*  Paula, I know you are a Catholic, so how did you feel, not just in terms of losing a world leader, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3617.48s)]
*  but also, I suppose, your spiritual connection to him? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3624.48s)]
*  Well, I guess I'm not a practising Catholic, but I guess being here, I'm swept up in the emotions of things, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3627.48s)]
*  and it's brought back some memories of my childhood, my schooling, so yeah, and it's definitely been a diversion from our holiday. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3633.48s)]
*  I've made Craig come along to some of these events, and particularly because of Easter Sunday service, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3643.48s)]
*  we came for that not knowing that that was on as well, and so we diverted from our holiday and came to be here for that service, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3652.48s)]
*  and again today, seeing different people, the type of worship, and yeah, just being amongst these people and their belief. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3661.48s)]
*  What did you make of Pope Francis? How did he strike you? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3669.48s)]
*  A caring, humble man. We only found out yesterday because we were actually in there, which again is quite ironic on tour. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3673.48s)]
*  Our tour guide spoke to us and mentioned something about his accommodation and where he wanted to live, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3683.48s)]
*  rather than wanting to live in something more elaborate, he had asked to live in... [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3689.48s)]
*  The guest house, Santa Marta guest house. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3696.48s)]
*  Yeah, so we thought that straight away that matched what we'd heard about him over the years, about his kindness, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3699.48s)]
*  and maybe that he believed in being that kind of kind person. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3707.48s)]
*  What about his social views, slightly more progressive, on the more moderate side, let's say, of the Catholic Church? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3716.48s)]
*  Paul, did that chime with your views? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3724.48s)]
*  It certainly did. I'm hoping, we were talking earlier, we're hoping that they vote in another liberal cardinal to follow in the teachings [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3728.48s)]
*  that he's been adapting, I think, to the modern world. They may go more conservative, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3736.48s)]
*  and I think we're quite interested in how that plays out. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3742.48s)]
*  But we very much respected the inclusive nature of some of his teachings and the reinterpretation of some of the Catholic doctrine over the past few years. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3745.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's appointed about 80% of those cardinals who will choose the next Pope, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3754.48s)]
*  so it is thought likely that it will be somebody who is more on that wing of the Church, the Francis wing of the Church, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3760.48s)]
*  but of course one never knows. Paula, what has been the reaction in Australia, actually, and also the reaction from the Australian Government? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3766.48s)]
*  Not so much on the Government, but part of how we found out, which again was quite ironic, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3773.48s)]
*  when we were walking around Rome, it was actually Craig's sister who sent us a message. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3780.48s)]
*  We didn't know that the Pope had passed, so she sent us a text message and said, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3786.48s)]
*  what is it like in Rome? Have you heard the news? And assumed that we had. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3792.48s)]
*  And she was the one that contacted us and actually let us know what had happened. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3797.48s)]
*  Have you heard about, you know, mourning or masses back in Australia, for example? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3803.48s)]
*  No, not at this stage. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3808.48s)]
*  No, but our current Prime Minister is an Italian Catholic of heritage and they're in an election campaign, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3810.48s)]
*  so I think they're fairly focused on that coming up and they may not make the trip over, unfortunately, for the funeral. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3816.48s)]
*  How important will it be for you to go inside the Basilica to say a final farewell to the Pope? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3822.48s)]
*  The idea of going in, perhaps tonight, you know, before midnight, yeah, I think it is important. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3828.48s)]
*  I'm hoping Craig will join me to be part of this. It's a very significant moment in history. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3836.48s)]
*  Craig, you're not Catholic, but is it important for you? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3843.48s)]
*  He was a significant world leader. I think, you know, I respect the role he plays in the world. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3846.48s)]
*  I respect the people here who are devout. The fact I chose not to be is irrelevant to me. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3852.48s)]
*  These people here who care very, very much and he was an important world figure. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3857.48s)]
*  So, you know, I respect the significance of this occasion and I'm very thankful I'm in some small part, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3861.48s)]
*  sort of part of it and can put it in my memories for the future. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3869.48s)]
*  Give us a sense, Paula, of the mood that you are seeing here. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3873.48s)]
*  I mean, it's such a busy square and, you know, you're seeing the clergy, you're seeing pilgrims, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3877.48s)]
*  you're seeing the faithful. I mean, I suppose it's... [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3883.48s)]
*  Had you imagined that St Peter's Square would be like this and we would see even more momentous a time, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3886.48s)]
*  of course, given what has happened? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3891.48s)]
*  No, I wasn't expecting it. A little bit because of Easter and I saw what happens here for Easter Sunday. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3893.48s)]
*  But when I look around now, I guess I knew. I knew that it would be, you know, significant to everybody. Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3901.48s)]
*  And is this bringing back, I mean, you said it's bringing back thoughts about your childhood. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3911.48s)]
*  I guess you were at a Catholic school or something or did you, I mean, were you raised in quite a Catholic way? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3915.48s)]
*  Yes, I was and Catholic schooling. So, yeah, it does bring back memories of that. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3920.48s)]
*  My parents were very Catholic, particularly my mum. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3928.48s)]
*  Yes, I think I even said to Craig a couple of times, I wish my mum was here. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3933.48s)]
*  I know how important it would have been for her. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3939.48s)]
*  Would she have been a fan of Pope Francis? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3943.48s)]
*  I think so. I think she would have also appreciated how the Catholic Church was moving. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3945.48s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit more inclusive. And I think she would have, you know, she would have actually thought that that was a great way for the future. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3953.48s)]
*  What do you feel needs to move in the Catholic Church in this 2000 year old institution that moves very slowly? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3962.48s)]
*  Well, you'd hope. Some of the things that we'd spoken about that now the Catholic Church are beginning to accept. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3970.48s)]
*  We even spoke as we are seeing some of the people pass through. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3980.48s)]
*  We had conversations about what country the person may come from and that kind of background. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3984.48s)]
*  Whether we're ready for an African leader or an Asian leader of the Catholic Church, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3991.48s)]
*  there's a lot of questions about how progressive the church will be ready to be now or whether it will be another generation before we see something like that happen. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3997.48s)]
*  But we look on with great interest. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4006.48s)]
*  Craig and Paula, it's been lovely to talk to you. Happy rest of your holidays and I hope you manage to make it inside the Basilica to say a final farewell. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4008.48s)]
*  Thanks for talking to us. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4015.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4016.48s)]
*  So thoughts will go forward in a few days time, certainly after the funeral, to the successor to Pope Francis. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4017.48s)]
*  Craig and Paula were mentioning there. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4025.48s)]
*  There is speculation that maybe the Cardinals will end up choosing an ex-Pope from a part of the world that has not yet been represented at the top level of the Catholic Church. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4026.48s)]
*  Maybe Africa, maybe Asia, or maybe it will swing back to Italy, which, of course, has been the source of so many Popes over the centuries. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4035.48s)]
*  All of that will be questions to come in the Conclave, which is expected to start in the week of the 5th of May. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4044.48s)]
*  But for now, three days of lying in state and then that funeral on Saturday. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4049.48s)]
*  With that, Lewis, back to you in London. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4053.48s)]
*  Mark, thank you. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4055.48s)]
*  Around the world, across the UK, this is BBC News. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4056.48s)]

*  In the past few hours, the body of the late Pope Francis has been moved from the chapel [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5174.28s)]
*  at his residence in Casa Santa Marta, where he chose to live, to St. Peter's Basilica, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5178.92s)]

*  Mourners who have been queuing since the early hours of the morning to pay their respects [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5208.4400000000005s)]
*  applauded as the procession made its way through St. Peter's Square. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5213.32s)]
*  These are the live pictures of St. Peter's Square where you can see crowds. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5218.48s)]
*  Well, this is still inside, queuing to pay their final respects to the late pontiff. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5222.32s)]
*  The body of Pope Francis will remain there until the funeral on Saturday, which will [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5228.04s)]
*  be attended by leaders from around the world. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5231.919999999999s)]
*  I speak to my colleague, former Rome correspondent Mark Lowy. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5235.679999999999s)]
*  Mark, just talk us through what's been happening there. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5239.08s)]
*  Hi Lewis, yes, well, it's been a busy morning here on St. Peter's Square. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5243.32s)]
*  As you can imagine, with thousands of people crowding onto the square, watching that service [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5246.36s)]
*  that was on big screens behind me as the coffin of Pope Francis was taken from the residence [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5251.36s)]
*  where he lived during his 12 years as Pope, the Santa Marta residence inside the Vatican, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5258.12s)]
*  and it was taken to St Peter's Basilica, where it now lies before the altar of the [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5263.88s)]
*  Confession, an altar beneath which it is believed that the tomb of St Peter lies. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5268.599999999999s)]
*  Of course, remember, popes are thought to be by the faithful successors to St Peter. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5274.04s)]
*  It's an altar that is covered by a bronze baldikin, which was designed and created by [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5279.92s)]
*  the Baroque 16th century artist Bernini, and then that lies below the fantastic gilded [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5285.32s)]
*  dome of St Peter's Basilica, which is from Michelangelo. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5293.12s)]
*  And then that basilica will be open until midnight today and tomorrow for the faithful [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5297.28s)]
*  to file in to try to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis, who lies in that open coffin. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5302.24s)]
*  He's been temporarily embalmed. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5307.48s)]
*  He is wearing a mitre, his red vestments. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5309.4s)]
*  He's holding rosary beads. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5312.28s)]
*  And then on Friday, the basilica will close at 7 p.m., ready for that funeral to start [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5314.04s)]
*  on Saturday morning, a funeral that will attract world leaders, royalty and heads of state [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5318.88s)]
*  from around the world. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5324.24s)]
*  And then following the funeral, the coffin will be taken across Rome to the Basilica [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5325.92s)]
*  of Santa Maria Maggiore, which is where Pope Francis wants to be buried. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5331.48s)]
*  It's more than a century since a pope was not buried at the Vatican and very much symbolic [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5334.639999999999s)]
*  of how Francis wanted a humbler, simpler end to his life. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5340.16s)]
*  Well, among those hoping to get into the basilica to say a final farewell to Pope Francis are [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5345.28s)]
*  Macarena and Luis from Mexico, who are actually over here on their honeymoon. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5350.4s)]
*  Congratulations first of all for your wedding. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5355.24s)]
*  I gather you were hoping to have a papal audience today. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5358.16s)]
*  Yes, we came here because the pope receives newlyweds and he gives like a special blessing. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5361.56s)]
*  So we just came to Rome. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5367.88s)]
*  I think that was the best way to start our marriage. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5369.56s)]
*  And we were just hoping to see the pope. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5372.4s)]
*  And now we're just hoping to go in and be able to pay our respects. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5374.52s)]
*  And how did it feel, Macarena? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5378.92s)]
*  I understand you were in transit to Rome when you got the news of his death on Monday morning. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5380.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not about us. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5385.96s)]
*  So we're just happy to be here in such a special moment as well. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5388.280000000001s)]
*  And we're happy to pay our respects to the pope. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5391.400000000001s)]
*  What was going through your mind when you got that news? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5394.2s)]
*  And it must have been an emotional moment for you both. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5396.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was emotional. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5399.08s)]
*  And we were like, wow, I can't believe that we're going to be in Rome when this is happening. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5400.360000000001s)]
*  We're also happy. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5405.400000000001s)]
*  Like, we're not going to receive the papal audience. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5407.96s)]
*  But it's so much happening right now. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5411.44s)]
*  And we're just happy to be here and pay our respects. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5413.28s)]
*  What would it have meant, Luis, to have that audience today? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5416.719999999999s)]
*  It would have meant a lot. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5421.16s)]
*  But as Macarena said, it's a very important day. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5422.08s)]
*  It's a very important couple of days just to be here to pray. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5426.32s)]
*  And just to see it's more important. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5429.679999999999s)]
*  So I think we received the blessing from above. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5432.24s)]
*  So you feel that being able to go inside there and see him in his final resting place [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5435.44s)]
*  almost final resting place, do you feel that that will create, in a sense, that kind of [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5441.32s)]
*  connection that you would have had maybe in person today? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5445.0s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5447.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the Pope Francis is a saint. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5448.44s)]
*  And he will bless us from heaven. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5451.88s)]
*  And we're very happy just to be here and to feel that connection. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5454.28s)]
*  We felt that already. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5457.16s)]
*  And we're very blessed. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5458.36s)]
*  Macarena, what was it about Pope Francis that you loved? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5459.639999999999s)]
*  I loved his humility. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5463.88s)]
*  Was it important for you that he was the first Pope from the Americas? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5467.16s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5471.72s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5472.84s)]
*  He was from Argentina. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5473.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5476.12s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I think Pope Francis came in at a very important time. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5477.16s)]
*  He's a Pope for the people. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5482.28s)]
*  He taught us to be just more in-depth with our, more in touch with other persons and to be more humble. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5483.8s)]
*  So I think Pope Francis is what we needed. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5491.0s)]
*  And we're just very happy to be here. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5493.96s)]
*  And many of his social views, many of his political views were, for example, he was very much a voice of migrants and dispossessed. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5495.72s)]
*  Of course, there's a lot of focus on migration at the moment, America from Mexico. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5505.080000000001s)]
*  Do Mexicans feel that he was kind of standing up for you? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5510.68s)]
*  He was a voice for you as a nation in many ways? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5513.96s)]
*  I think the Pope was a voice for everyone. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5516.68s)]
*  And I think that's what he wanted. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5518.76s)]
*  He wanted to be a voice for the people that maybe did not have a voice. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5521.0s)]
*  And that's what he represented. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5524.6s)]
*  What does it feel now that he is gone? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5527.64s)]
*  Does it feel that there is a hole in your lives? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5529.64s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I think he did what he had to do. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5532.52s)]
*  And now he's resting. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5536.6s)]
*  And now we're just going to wait for the conclave to the new Pope to come in. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5538.120000000001s)]
*  And that conclave is likely to begin in the week of the 5th of May, a conclave and an [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5543.400000000001s)]
*  elaborate secretive ceremony to choose the next Pope. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5547.400000000001s)]
*  Do you have any hopes that there could be maybe a Mexican Pope to take over? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5551.799999999999s)]
*  Well, whoever who's like the most able to take the place, it's going to be so. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5557.08s)]
*  Not really. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5564.5199999999995s)]
*  I think just like you said before, to pray and to have the best one and to the Cardinals [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5565.16s)]
*  are going to be in there to have the blessing from God and to make the right decision. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5571.639999999999s)]
*  And we're just very hopeful for the new Pope. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5575.48s)]
*  Do you hope that the next Pope would be in the same image of Francis, in a sense, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5578.12s)]
*  a more progressive wing of the church? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5583.48s)]
*  Or do you feel that? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5585.72s)]
*  I mean, do you do you do you fear that it could swing back in a different direction? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5587.0s)]
*  I think I'm not qualified enough to give my opinion in that regard. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5592.36s)]
*  Some people that are very, very qualified and have the grace of God will make that decision. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5596.68s)]
*  And whatever happens will be for the best. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5600.68s)]
*  Macarena, how important will it be for you to go inside that basilica? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5602.76s)]
*  I understand that it's going to be logistically quite difficult with thousands of people trying [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5606.92s)]
*  to get in today. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5611.88s)]
*  But can you sort of picture a little bit how you might feel as you're going through and [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5613.16s)]
*  seeing seeing him in his in his open coffin? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5617.64s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a lot of emotions, but I'm just I would just be really happy to be there [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5620.6s)]
*  and pay my respects. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5625.88s)]
*  Macarena and Luis, once again, congratulations to you both. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5628.2s)]
*  And I hope that you have a happy rest of your honeymoon. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5631.64s)]
*  And I hope you get in to be able to see Pope Francis in his coffin. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5634.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for talking to us today. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5638.280000000001s)]
*  So there are going to be very big crowds who will go in right through the day today. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5640.68s)]
*  You can see already there are crowds lining up here with the Italian police, the Carabinieri [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5645.64s)]
*  keeping guard. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5650.84s)]
*  And then, of course, it will be a huge security apparatus in place for Saturday with the likes [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5651.56s)]
*  of President Trump, President Macron of France, the Brazilian president, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5657.0s)]
*  Sikhi Astama, British Prime Minister already confirming their attendance at the funeral. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5661.72s)]
*  Then there will be nine days of mourning. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5666.76s)]
*  And we are expecting the conclave, that process that many of you will be familiar with, not [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5669.16s)]

*  That process will begin likely to be the week of the 5th of May as we will wait. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5677.4s)]
*  We'll be back here on St Peter's Square waiting for the white smoke from the Vatican to say [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5681.96s)]
*  that they have chosen the successor to Pope Francis. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5687.0s)]
*  With that, it's back to you, Lewis in London. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5690.12s)]
*  Mark, thank you so much for that. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5692.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to head from outside there where Mark is to inside. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5694.12s)]
*  These are the live pictures. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5697.5599999999995s)]
*  We're going to keep across these. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5699.32s)]
*  This is now the official period of the pope lying in state and there are expected to be [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5701.32s)]
*  thousands upon thousands of people that will queue and enter St Peter's Basilica there [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5707.48s)]
*  and file past the coffin, the late Pope Francis as his body lies in state there. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5713.4s)]
*  As we keep across these live pictures, we're going to speak to Tabitha Smith, Catholic [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5721.08s)]
*  journalist for Catholic magazine at the Tablet. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5725.32s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the programme. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5727.72s)]
*  Hi, thank you. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5729.4s)]
*  As we just see these pictures there of those thousands of people that will, over the next [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5730.44s)]
*  couple of days, file past the body of Pope Francis, just talk us through the significance [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5735.4s)]
*  of this moment. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5740.92s)]
*  I mean, it is an incredibly mournful time, but it is wonderful to see how many Catholics [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5742.28s)]
*  and non-Catholics are turning out to pay their respects. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5748.04s)]
*  I think, you know, looking at the footage from this morning, I was really struck by [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5751.320000000001s)]
*  that antithetical image of Pope Francis during COVID, you know, praying alone in St Peter's [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5756.68s)]
*  Square for the world. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5763.0s)]
*  And now after he's passed, the whole world has turned up to see him. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5764.280000000001s)]
*  And I think that's just indicative of how of such an amazing pope he was, that he really [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5768.84s)]
*  touched people's hearts. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5774.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, talk us through what you made and what stood out for you with the ceremony this [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5775.88s)]
*  morning, the moving of the body from the chapel in his residence through St Peter's Square [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5781.24s)]
*  and into a position there in St Peter's Basilica. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5787.24s)]
*  I think you could tell that the crowd and the procession was just full of huge respect [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5791.5599999999995s)]
*  for Francis, even down to his, you know, his coffin, you know, a very simple woodlined [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5797.0s)]
*  coffin. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5804.36s)]
*  And I think he kept that humility all the way to the end. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5804.92s)]
*  I'm sure I was in Rome for Pope Benedict's when he, Pope Benedict, lay in state. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5810.92s)]
*  And that, of course, was still a mournful time, but still very respectful time. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5815.799999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure that those, you know, thousands of people over the next few days are turning [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5820.599999999999s)]
*  up to see Pope Francis will be showing the same respect. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5825.08s)]
*  And during his time as the pope, he was very popular amongst certain quarters, of course, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5829.639999999999s)]
*  far less popular and criticized amongst others. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5834.84s)]
*  But let's focus for a moment just on young people. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5837.639999999999s)]
*  What do you think his influence was there? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5840.44s)]
*  I think Pope Francis was so important to young Catholics. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5843.08s)]
*  I mean, I was 10 years old when Pope Francis became pope in 2013. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5847.24s)]
*  And through that time, he's walked together with us as young people. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5854.44s)]
*  He has shown us how to be compassionate. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5858.44s)]
*  He's shown us how to care for the environment and to not be afraid to speak out for social [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5861.0s)]
*  justice. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5868.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5871.16s)]
*  And those issues, because, of course, he faced criticism on any, well, pick any issue, the [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5871.719999999999s)]
*  environment, the role of women, gay people, the handling of the child sex abuse scandals [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5878.12s)]
*  throughout the church, throughout the world. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5884.5199999999995s)]
*  There will always be the more progressive side of the church criticized him for not [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5886.36s)]
*  going far enough for the more conservative wing, criticized him for going too far. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5890.04s)]
*  What's your general stance? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5894.92s)]
*  I think a lot of people like to criticize the pope, like you say, for doing either too [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5898.12s)]
*  much or too little. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5903.719999999999s)]
*  And we have to remember that the pope is just one man. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5905.0s)]
*  And obviously, he comes into the papacy with his own views. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5908.599999999999s)]
*  And whoever the next successor will be will also have their own views and might change [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5913.72s)]
*  things. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5919.56s)]
*  We have to remember that if people are criticized, Francis, for not going too far, too little, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5920.360000000001s)]
*  we're not in his position. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5927.8s)]
*  We were not in his position. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5928.84s)]
*  So it's difficult for us to criticize him. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5930.2s)]
*  I think if any of us were in the position of the pope, we would be feeling the same [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5932.6s)]
*  stresses. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5937.64s)]
*  I think that the main thing that's a comfort to a lot of Catholics is that the spirit is [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5938.2s)]
*  leading the discernment of the church and its course. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5941.88s)]
*  And I think that I hope that the spirit continues to work through the coming weeks and into the [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5948.52s)]
*  conclave and the election of the new pope. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5954.76s)]
*  And that's a really important factor in deciding. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5956.2s)]
*  Well, let's just spend a moment on that then. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5960.76s)]
*  What will you be hoping for from the next pope? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5962.68s)]
*  Well, I think Francis has built a very firm foundation in terms of standing up for the [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5966.92s)]
*  marginalized groups and vulnerable people and also creating a foundation of compassion [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5974.68s)]
*  and love. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5980.52s)]
*  And I hope that the next pope builds upon that. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5981.08s)]
*  I think Francis has set the standard for a modern pope. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5985.0s)]
*  And I think whoever will be the new pope has a lot to live up to in that respect. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5991.32s)]
*  Francis touched so many hearts. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5995.4s)]
*  And I'm sure that whoever the next pope will be will be feeling that pressure. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5998.599999999999s)]
*  But I'm sure that he will be guided by the spirit and ultimately will be successful. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6003.32s)]
*  Tabitha Smith, thank you very much for coming on the program. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6009.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6012.28s)]

*  You're with BBC News. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6035.639999999999s)]
*  These are pictures of the pope lying in state. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6037.8s)]
*  Pope Francis's body has been moved from his residence at the Vatican [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6041.24s)]
*  to Lyon State at St. Peter's Basilica for a period of public mourning until his funeral [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6045.48s)]
*  on Saturday. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6051.0s)]
*  The clergy members are paying tribute to the late Pontiff after a short service. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6051.88s)]
*  Members of the Swiss Guard standing next to the coffin. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6057.96s)]
*  Today, many thousands of people are expected to file past the open coffin. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6062.84s)]
*  It's been a busy morning here on St. Peter's Square, as you can imagine, with thousands of [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6068.2s)]
*  people crowding onto the square, watching that service that was on big screens behind me as the [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6072.04s)]
*  coffin of Pope Francis was taken from the residence where he lived during his 12 years as pope, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6078.6s)]
*  the Santa Marta residence inside the Vatican, and it was taken to St. Peter's Basilica, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6083.96s)]
*  where it now lies before the altar of the Confession, an altar beneath which it is believed [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6089.8s)]
*  that the tomb of St. Peter lies. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6095.320000000001s)]
*  Of course, remember, popes are thought to be by the faithful successors to St. Peter. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6097.64s)]
*  It's an altar that is covered by a bronze baldikin, which was designed and created by the [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6103.48s)]
*  Baroque 16th century artist Bernini, and then that lies below the fantastic gilded dome of St. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6109.639999999999s)]
*  Peter's Basilica, which is from Michelangelo. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6117.719999999999s)]
*  And then that basilica will be open until midnight today and tomorrow for the faithful to [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6120.839999999999s)]
*  file in to try to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis, who lies in that open coffin. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6126.36s)]
*  He's been temporarily embalmed. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6131.0s)]
*  He is wearing a mitre, his red vestments, he's holding rosary beads. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6133.0s)]
*  And then on Friday, the basilica will close at 7pm, ready for that funeral to start on [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6137.56s)]
*  Saturday morning, a funeral that will attract world leaders, royalty and heads of state from [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6142.84s)]
*  around the world. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6148.44s)]
*  And then following the funeral, the coffin will be taken across Rome to the Basilica of Santa [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6149.48s)]
*  Maria Maggiore, which is where Pope Francis wants to be buried. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6154.68s)]
*  It's more than a century since a pope was not buried at the Vatican. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6158.2s)]
*  And very much symbolic of how Francis wanted a humbler, simpler end to his life. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6162.6s)]
*  Well, among those hoping to get into the basilica to say a final farewell to Pope Francis are [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6169.08s)]
*  Macarena and Luis from Mexico, who are actually over here on their honeymoon. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6174.200000000001s)]
*  Congratulations, first of all, for your wedding. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6178.84s)]
*  And I gather you were hoping to have a papal audience today. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6181.4800000000005s)]
*  Today, yeah, we came here because the pope receives newlyweds and he gives like a special [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6185.56s)]
*  blessing. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6191.08s)]
*  So we just came to Rome. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6191.56s)]
*  I think that was the best way to start our marriage. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6193.320000000001s)]
*  And we were just hoping to see the pope. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6195.96s)]
*  And now we're just hoping to go in and be able to pay our respects. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6197.88s)]
*  And how did it feel, Macarena? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6202.52s)]
*  I understand you were in transit to Rome when you got the news of his death on Monday morning. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6204.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not about us. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6209.72s)]
*  So we're just happy to be here in such a special moment as well. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6211.88s)]
*  And we're happy to pay our respects to the pope. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6215.160000000001s)]
*  What was going through your mind when you got that news? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6217.88s)]
*  And it must have been an emotional moment for you both. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6220.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was emotional. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6222.84s)]
*  And we were like, wow, I can't believe that we're going to be in Rome when this is happening. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6224.12s)]
*  We're also happy. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6229.72s)]
*  Like, we're not going to receive the papal audience, but it's so much happening right [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6231.72s)]
*  now. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6236.76s)]
*  And we're just happy to be here and pay our respects. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6237.0s)]
*  What would it have meant, Luis, to have that audience today? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6240.4400000000005s)]
*  It would have meant a lot. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6244.76s)]
*  But as Macarena said, it's a very important day. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6245.88s)]
*  It's a very important couple of days just to be here to pray and just to feel everybody [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6249.96s)]
*  praying. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6256.12s)]
*  It's more important. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6256.52s)]
*  So I think we received the blessing from above. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6257.96s)]
*  So you feel that being able to go inside there and see him in his final resting place, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6261.16s)]
*  almost final resting place, do you feel that that will create in a sense that kind of connection [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6267.0s)]
*  that you would have had maybe in person today? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6271.16s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6273.32s)]
*  I think the Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6274.2s)]
*  And we're very happy just to be here and to feel that connection. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6280.04s)]
*  We felt it already and we're very blessed. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6283.08s)]
*  Macarena, what was it about Pope Francis that you loved? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6285.4s)]
*  I loved his humility. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6289.639999999999s)]
*  And was it important for you that he was the first pope from the Americas? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6292.76s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6297.48s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6298.599999999999s)]
*  He was from Argentina. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6299.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6301.88s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I think Pope Francis came in at a very important time. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6302.92s)]
*  He's a pope for the people. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6307.64s)]
*  He taught us to be just more in-depth with our more in touch with other persons and to [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6309.88s)]
*  be more humble. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6316.04s)]
*  So I think Pope Francis is what we needed and we're just very happy to be here. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6316.76s)]
*  And many of his social views, many of his political views were, for example, he was [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6321.4s)]
*  very much a voice of migrants and dispossessed. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6325.96s)]
*  Of course, there's a lot of focus on migration at the moment in America, from Mexico. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6330.84s)]
*  Do Mexicans feel that he was kind of standing up for you? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6336.4400000000005s)]
*  He was a voice for you as a nation in many ways? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6339.72s)]
*  I think the pope was a voice for everyone. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6342.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think that's what he wanted. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6344.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6346.360000000001s)]
*  He wanted to be a voice for the people that maybe did not have a voice. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6346.76s)]
*  And that's what he represented. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6350.360000000001s)]
*  Macarena, what does it feel now that he is gone? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6352.68s)]
*  Does it feel that there is a hole in your lives? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6355.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I think he did what he had to do and now he's resting. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6358.28s)]
*  And now we're just going to wait for the conclave, the new pope to come in. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6363.879999999999s)]
*  And that conclave is likely to begin on the week of the 5th of May, a conclave and an [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6369.24s)]
*  elaborate, secretive ceremony to choose the next pope. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6373.16s)]
*  Do you have any hopes that there could be maybe a Mexican pope to take over? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6378.28s)]
*  Well, whoever who's like the most able to take the place, it's going to be so. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6382.84s)]
*  Yeah, not really. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6389.4s)]
*  I think just like I said before, to pray and to have the best one and to the cardinals [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6391.0s)]
*  are going to be in there to have the blessing from God and to make the right decision. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6397.48s)]
*  And we're just very hopeful for the new pope. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6401.32s)]
*  Do you hope that the next pope would be in the same image of Francis, in a sense, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6403.88s)]
*  a more progressive wing of the church? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6409.24s)]
*  Or do you feel that? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6411.4s)]
*  I mean, do you do you do you fear that it could swing back in a different direction? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6412.76s)]
*  I think I'm not qualified enough to give my opinion in that regard. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6418.12s)]
*  Some people that are very, very qualified and have the grace of God will make that [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6422.44s)]
*  decision and whatever happens will be for the best. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6425.96s)]
*  Macarena, how important will it be for you to go inside that basilica? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6428.5199999999995s)]
*  I understand that it's going to be logistically quite difficult with thousands of people trying [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6432.679999999999s)]
*  to get in today. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6437.72s)]
*  But can you sort of picture a little bit how you might feel as you're going through and [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6439.0s)]
*  seeing seeing him in his in his open coffin? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6443.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a lot of emotions, but I'm just I would just be really happy [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6446.4400000000005s)]
*  to be there and pay my respects. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6451.0s)]
*  Macarena and Luis, once again, congratulations to you both and I hope that you have a happy [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6453.96s)]
*  rest of your honeymoon and I hope you get in to be able to see Pope Francis in his open coffin. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6459.64s)]
*  Thank you very much for talking to us today. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6464.04s)]
*  So there are going to be very big crowds who will go in right through the day today. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6466.4400000000005s)]
*  You can see already there are crowds lining up here with the Italian police, the Carabinieri, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6471.400000000001s)]
*  keeping guard. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6476.6s)]
*  And then, of course, it will be a huge security apparatus in place for Saturday with the likes [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6477.400000000001s)]
*  of President Trump, President Macron of France, the Brazilian president, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6482.84s)]
*  Siqueir Starmer, British Prime Minister, already confirming their attendance at the funeral. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6487.56s)]
*  Then there will be nine days of mourning and we are expecting the conclave, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6492.6s)]
*  that process that many of you will be familiar with, not least from the Oscar nominated film [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6496.92s)]
*  with Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6500.92s)]
*  That process will begin likely to be the week of the 5th of May as we will wait. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6503.240000000001s)]
*  We'll be back here on St Peter's Square waiting for the white smoke from the Vatican to say [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6507.72s)]
*  that they have chosen the successor to Pope Francis. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6512.84s)]
*  We're going to speak to Tabatha Smith, Catholic journalist for the Catholic magazine, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6515.8s)]
*  The Tablet. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6520.200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the programme. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6520.76s)]
*  Hi, thank you. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6522.6s)]
*  As we just see these pictures there of those thousands of people that will, over the next [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6523.4800000000005s)]
*  couple of days, file past the body of Pope Francis, just talk us through the significance [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6528.52s)]
*  of this moment. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6534.04s)]
*  I mean, it is an incredibly mournful time, but it is wonderful to see how many Catholics [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6535.400000000001s)]
*  and non-Catholics are turning out to pay their respects. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6540.84s)]
*  I think, you know, looking at the footage from this morning, I was really struck by [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6544.360000000001s)]
*  that antithetical image of Pope Francis during Covid, you know, praying alone in St Peter's [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6549.72s)]
*  Square for the world. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6556.04s)]
*  And now after he's passed, the whole world has turned up to see him. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6557.400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's just indicative of how such an amazing pope he was, that he really [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6561.88s)]
*  touched people's hearts. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6567.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, talk us through what you made and what stood out for you with the ceremony this morning, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6569.0s)]
*  the moving of the body from the chapel in his residence through St Peter's Square and [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6574.68s)]
*  into a position there in St Peter's Basilica. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6580.84s)]
*  I think you could tell that the crowd and the procession was just full of huge respect [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6584.6s)]
*  for Francis, even down to his, you know, his coffin, you know, a very simple woodlined [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6590.12s)]
*  coffin. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6597.400000000001s)]
*  And I think he kept that humility all the way to the end. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6597.96s)]
*  I'm sure I was in Rome for Pope Benedict's when he, Pope Benedict, lay in state. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6603.96s)]
*  And that, of course, was still a mournful time, but still very respectful time. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6608.92s)]
*  And I'm sure that those, you know, thousands of people over the next few days are turning [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6613.64s)]
*  up to see Pope Francis will be showing the same respect. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6618.2s)]
*  And during his time as the pope, he was very popular amongst certain quarters, of course, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6623.88s)]
*  far less popular and criticized amongst others. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6628.92s)]
*  But let's focus for a moment just on young people. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6631.56s)]
*  What do you think his influence was there? [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6634.4400000000005s)]
*  I think Pope Francis was so important to young Catholics. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6637.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was 10 years old when Pope Francis became pope in 2013. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6641.320000000001s)]
*  And through that time, he's walked together with us as young people. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6648.6s)]
*  He has shown us how to be compassionate. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6653.320000000001s)]
*  He's shown us how to care for the environment and to not be afraid to speak out for social [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6655.48s)]
*  justice. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6662.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6665.4s)]
*  And those issues, because, of course, he faced criticism on any, well, pick any issue, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6666.599999999999s)]
*  the environment, the role of women, gay people, the handling of the child sex abuse scandals [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6672.5199999999995s)]
*  throughout the church, throughout the world. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6679.08s)]
*  There will always be the more progressive side of the church criticized him for not [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6681.24s)]
*  going far enough, for the more conservative wing criticized him for going too far. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6685.16s)]
*  What's your general stance? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6689.88s)]
*  I think a lot of people like to criticize the pope, like you say, for doing either too [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6693.0s)]
*  much or too little. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6698.76s)]
*  And we have to remember that the pope is just one man. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6700.2s)]
*  And obviously, he comes into the papacy with his own views. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6703.639999999999s)]
*  And whoever the next successor will be will also have their own views and might change [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6708.36s)]
*  things. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6712.599999999999s)]
*  We have to remember that if people are criticized, Francis, for not going too far, too little, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6713.4s)]
*  we're not in his position. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6720.759999999999s)]
*  We were not in his position. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6721.879999999999s)]
*  So it's difficult for us to criticize him. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6723.24s)]
*  I think if any of us were in the position of the pope, we would be feeling the same [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6725.639999999999s)]
*  stresses. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6730.679999999999s)]
*  I think the main thing that's a comfort to a lot of Catholics is that the spirit is [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6731.16s)]
*  leading the discernment of the church and its course. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6734.92s)]
*  And I think that I hope that the spirit continues to work through the coming weeks and into [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6741.56s)]
*  the conclave and the election of the new pope. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6747.4s)]
*  And that's a really important factor. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6749.32s)]
*  Well, let's just spend a moment on that then. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6753.88s)]
*  What will you be hoping for from the next pope? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6755.72s)]
*  Well, I think Francis has built a very firm foundation in terms of standing up for the [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6759.96s)]
*  marginalized groups and vulnerable people. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6767.72s)]
*  And also creating a foundation of compassion and love. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6770.68s)]
*  And I hope that the next pope builds upon that. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6774.12s)]
*  I think Francis has set the standard for a modern pope. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6778.04s)]
*  And I think whoever will be the new pope has a lot to live up to in that respect. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6784.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, Francis touched so many hearts. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6788.2s)]
*  And I'm sure that whoever the next pope will be will be feeling that pressure. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6791.64s)]
*  But I'm sure that he will be guided by the spirit and ultimately will be successful. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6795.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6825.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6855.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6885.8s)]
*  Hello, welcome to the program. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6945.8s)]
*  In the past few hours, the body of the late pope Francis has been moved from the chapel [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6960.4400000000005s)]
*  at his residence, Casa Santa Marta, where he chose to live, to St. Peter's Basilica, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6965.0s)]
*  where it will remain lying in state until the funeral on Saturday. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6970.28s)]
*  The pope died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6974.2s)]
*  The church bells toll as the procession of cardinals and priests accompany the open [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6984.2s)]
*  coffin short distance from the chapel through the city state. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6989.72s)]
*  These are the live pictures where you can see crowds queuing to pay their final respects to [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6995.8s)]
*  the late pontiff. The body of Pope Francis will remain there until the funeral on Saturday, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7001.16s)]
*  which will be attended by leaders from around the world. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7006.28s)]
*  Earlier, my colleague Mark Lowen spoke to people at the Vatican who have come to pay their respects. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7009.8s)]
*  It's been a busy morning, as you can imagine here on St. Peter's Square. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7015.8s)]
*  Thousands of people have been waiting by the barrier to catch a glimpse of the basilica [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7019.5599999999995s)]
*  and the procession into the main door of the basilica with the coffin of Pope Francis, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7025.240000000001s)]
*  which is now lying before the altar of the Confession inside the basilica, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7032.200000000001s)]
*  under which is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7038.120000000001s)]
*  Remember, each pope is elected to be the successor to St. Peter. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7042.120000000001s)]
*  That is where the open coffin of Pope Francis will lie now until [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7048.4400000000005s)]
*  Saturday morning when the funeral begins. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7053.56s)]
*  They are expecting tens of thousands of people every day to go into the basilica until midnight [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7056.68s)]
*  every day, until Friday evening at 7pm when the basilica will be closed before that funeral on [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7061.8s)]
*  Saturday, a funeral which is going to attract heads of state and world leaders from right across the [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7068.280000000001s)]
*  globe. Then, of course, Pope Francis will be buried on the other side of Rome at the Basilica [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7074.84s)]
*  di Santa Maria Maggiore. It is more than a century since a pope was buried outside the Vatican, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7079.96s)]
*  and that is very much a sign of how Pope Francis wanted a more humble, more simple [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7087.56s)]
*  end to his life. Well, two of those who are hoping to go inside the basilica to catch a final glimpse [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7093.4800000000005s)]
*  of the pope are Craig and Paula, who are over from Australia. They were here on holiday and [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7099.88s)]
*  then saw the news, heard the news that the pope had died. Craig, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7107.4800000000005s)]
*  just give me a sense of your reaction when you heard that news. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7111.56s)]
*  Well, we weren't surprised, I have to say, because we knew he had been very ill, but we were here on [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7115.4800000000005s)]
*  the Sunday service when he spent some time on the balcony. We were staying in a hotel only a few [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7121.4800000000005s)]
*  metres away and we heard the bells ringing at 7.35 in the morning. We thought that was a little on, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7127.160000000001s)]
*  and then we looked on the news and we found out that he passed away overnight, which was [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7131.88s)]
*  very ironic or bizarre in a way, because we'd only just seen him the night before [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7136.52s)]
*  on the balcony and he seemed okay. He seemed okay, but seemed frail as he wished people a happy [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7140.52s)]
*  Easter. Yeah, very much, but to learn that he died of a secondary illness rather than pneumonia [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7146.280000000001s)]
*  was interesting, but not surprising. Paula, I know you are a Catholic, so how did you feel, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7154.360000000001s)]
*  not just in terms of losing a world leader, but also I suppose your spiritual connection to him? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7161.160000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess I'm not a practicing Catholic, but I guess being here I'm swept up in the emotions [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7166.6s)]
*  of things and it's brought back some memories of my childhood, my schooling, so yeah, and it's [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7172.68s)]
*  definitely been a diversion from our holiday. I've made Craig come along to some of these events, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7180.68s)]
*  and particularly because of Easter Sunday service, we came for that not knowing that that was [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7188.120000000001s)]
*  on as well, and so we got out of our holiday and came to be here for that service, and again today [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7195.16s)]
*  seeing different people, the type of worship, and yeah, just being amongst these people. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7202.92s)]
*  I never leave. What did you make of Pope Francis? How did he strike you? A caring, humble man. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7208.599999999999s)]
*  We only found out yesterday because we're actually in there, which again is our tour guide [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7216.44s)]
*  spoke to us and mentioned something about his accommodation and where he wanted to live, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7222.5199999999995s)]
*  rather than wanting to live in something more elaborate. He had asked to live in [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7227.5599999999995s)]
*  the guest house, Santa Monica guest house. So yeah, we thought that straight away that matched what [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7234.919999999999s)]
*  we'd heard about him over the years, about his kindness, and maybe that he [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7240.44s)]
*  believed in being that kind of kind person. What about his social views, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7247.32s)]
*  slightly more progressive on the more moderate side, let's say, of the [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7254.44s)]
*  of the Catholic Church? Paul, how did that chime with your views? It certainly did. I'm hoping, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7258.04s)]
*  we were talking earlier, we're hoping that they vote in another liberal cardinal to follow in [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7263.639999999999s)]
*  the teachings that he's been adapting to the modern world, and I think that's a good thing. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7269.88s)]
*  They may go more conservative and I think we're quite interested in how that plays out, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7277.24s)]
*  but we very much respected the inclusive nature of some of his teachings and his reinterpretation [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7282.68s)]
*  of some of the Catholic doctrine over the past few years. Yeah, I mean he's appointed about 80% [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7288.12s)]
*  of those cardinals who will choose the next pope, so it is thought likely that it will be [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7294.2s)]
*  somebody who is more on that wing of the church, the Francis wing of the church, but of course one [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7300.6s)]
*  never knows. Paula, what has been the reaction in Australia actually, and also the reaction from [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7304.52s)]
*  the Australian government? Not so much on the government, but part of how we found out, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7310.120000000001s)]
*  which again was quite ironic, when we were out walking around Rome it was actually Craig's [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7316.360000000001s)]
*  sister who sent us a message. We didn't know that the pope had passed, so she sent us a text message [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7322.52s)]
*  and said, what is it like in Rome? Have you heard the news? And assumed that we had, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7330.12s)]
*  and she was the one that contacted us and actually let us know what had happened. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7335.0s)]
*  Have you heard about, you know, mourning or masses back in Australia, for example? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7341.16s)]
*  No, not at this stage. No, but our current prime minister is an Italian Catholic of heritage and [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7346.92s)]
*  they're in an election campaign, so I think they're fairly focused on that coming up and they may not [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7352.68s)]
*  make the trip over, unfortunately, for the funeral. How important will it be for you to go inside the [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7357.88s)]
*  basilica to say a final farewell to the pope? The idea of going in, perhaps tonight, you know, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7363.64s)]
*  before midnight, yeah, I think it is important. I'm hoping Craig will join me to be part of this. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7371.0s)]
*  It's a very significant moment in history. That was Mark Lerner asking the questions. Now, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7378.04s)]
*  Pope Francis never returned to his native Argentina, where he served as the archbishop [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7386.12s)]
*  of Buenos Aires during his papacy, but he left a legacy there of being someone who helped the [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7391.8s)]
*  most vulnerable. Our South America correspondent, Irony Wells reports. Etched into the city's streets [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7396.76s)]
*  and the memories of its people as their archbishop, as an advocate for the poor, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7407.16s)]
*  as one of them. This message is a sentiment many here share. He reminded people that in the church [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7414.76s)]
*  there is room for everyone, everyone, everyone. This cathedral in Buenos Aires has opened its [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7422.68s)]
*  doors for mourners here to write a final message to him or simply to offer their prayers. Many of [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7430.76s)]
*  them have praised his work, helping the poor from the country's soup kitchens to its prisons. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7441.08s)]
*  He's well known for his action towards the most humble people from different places. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7447.8s)]
*  In everyday life, he was very close to ordinary people. It is a source of pride because he's the [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7452.84s)]
*  first pope, not only from Argentina, but from Latin America. I hope his legacy continues. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7459.0s)]
*  The church was not the only community he dedicated a lifetime to. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7465.16s)]
*  Another was San Lorenzo, his local football club. His fans say his commitment lasted until the end. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7472.36s)]
*  His membership card number was his age, 88, and the local time that he died in Argentina, 235. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7480.76s)]
*  Imagine that the first archbishop from Argentina is also a member of your club. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7489.48s)]
