Video Description: Ukraine may have to give up land as part of a peace deal with Russia, Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has told the BBC.
 
His comments have come after a growing pressure on Ukraine from US President Donald Trump to accept territorial concessions.
 
"One of the scenarios isâ€¦ to give up territory. It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary," he said.
 
The former boxing champion-turned politician was speaking hours after a Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80.
 
But the 53-year-old stressed that the Ukrainian people would "never accept occupation" by Russia.

# Ukraine may have to give up land for peace, says Kyiv Mayor Klitschko | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0)
*  We start in Ukraine where the mayor of Kiev has become one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=0.0s)]
*  to suggest the country may have to give away territory as part of any peace deal with Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=5.2s)]
*  Speaking to the BBC Vitaly Klitschko acknowledged that such a decision would be unfair and painful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=10.4s)]
*  but could be a temporary solution to help end the fighting. The US wants Ukraine to accept [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine in return for a ceasefire. Despite the recent strikes on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=21.44s)]
*  Kiev that killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others, President Trump says he is continuing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=26.8s)]
*  to put pressure on Russia to reach a peace deal. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow today [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=32.64s)]
*  for talks with President Putin. In the US plan for peace, according to leaks, the deal would see [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=39.04s)]
*  Russia keep the territories that it now occupies in eastern Ukraine. The US will accept them as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=45.28s)]
*  Russia will give up its ambition to control the rest of these four regions, land it has failed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=52.24s)]
*  to secure militarily. In return, the US would accept Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  it illegally occupied in 2014. Our correspondent Anna Foster is in the Ukrainian capital and has [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=63.84s)]
*  been speaking to Mayor Klitschko as well as assessing the overall situation with the proposed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=70.08s)]
*  ceasefire deal. Certainly when we look at the ceasefire proposal that the US is putting forward [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=74.88s)]
*  to these two sides, and we don't know the content of it, but we are now coming to the understanding [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=80.96s)]
*  that a lot of it is rooted in the idea of borders, of land and territory and control, and particularly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=87.28s)]
*  in Ukraine that is domestically a very sensitive issue. President Zelensky campaigned for that job [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  saying that he would never, for example, cede Crimea to Russia, and yet that is something that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=98.8s)]
*  is now being suggested for peace. And what we have here in Ukraine today is one of the country's most [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=103.28s)]
*  powerful politicians Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of this city, who I sat down with yesterday to talk [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=108.88s)]
*  about whether or not Ukraine should consider giving up some of its land. And he said temporarily he [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  thought that perhaps they should. And we discussed whether or not those US talks are really moving [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  these two countries any closer to a ceasefire. What should the international community, world leaders, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=126.96s)]
*  the US and European leaders, what should they be doing differently now to try and get some kind of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=134.56s)]
*  progress? It's not an easy situation in Ukraine. It's difficult. We have the problems with many [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=140.96s)]
*  resources, financial resources, weapons, human resources, but Russians have not an easy situation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=148.88s)]
*  They also have problems. Can you imagine one of the powerful men in the world, he presents himself, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Putin, goes to North Korea asking about the weapons, asking about the soldiers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=165.84s)]
*  Endurance, with quality. We have to be strong. We need support. We need support because everyone [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=176.4s)]
*  in Europe has to understand we defend not just our homeland. We're defending everyone of you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=185.52s)]
*  Do you think that Ukraine will have to give up territory to reach a ceasefire? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a very difficult political decision to give up our territory [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  to Russia. It's not a solution. It's not fair. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=210.64s)]
*  Would you consider it if it brought peace? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  It's very, it can be difficult decision for President Zelensky. He has to find a solution. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=228.16s)]
*  Maybe it will be a painful solution for the peace. But I guess we never accept [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=239.12s)]
*  occupation of Russia. So you think it might have to happen? Temporary. Temporary. It happens, but [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=251.68s)]
*  for long term to accept the whole territory, the whole Ukraine, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=261.36s)]
*  belong to, not belong to Ukraine anymore, belong to Russia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=265.28s)]
*  I guess Ukrainian people never accept that. I understand. It's really difficult. It's really [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  difficult because on one hand, as you say, it's your country. But on the other hand, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=276.64s)]
*  people are dying every day. It's the hardest question. I realize it's really difficult to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=282.96s)]
*  find an answer. But the pressure at the moment from the US seems to be that they want Ukraine [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=289.28s)]
*  to give up territory to try and end the war. That's what they think the solution is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=296.64s)]
*  Right now, we don't take a solution. Right now, a lot of conversation about possible solution. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=305.2s)]
*  And one of the scenario, what you say, is to give up the territory. It's not fair. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=314.56s)]
*  But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be solution. Temporary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=322.16s)]
*  The relationship that President Zelensky and President Trump have is a very difficult one. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=330.48s)]
*  It hasn't gone well in these last few weeks. What would you do differently [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=336.64s)]
*  if you were having those conversations? How would you approach it? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=342.0s)]
*  In the position of Trump or in the position of Zelensky? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  Good question. In Mr. Zelensky's position. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=349.6s)]
*  First of all, I want to say thank you. A thousand times thank you for the United States. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  And from the beginning of the war, the United States gave to Ukraine huge support. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  We very appreciate for that. Without support, we can't survive. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  It's ammunition, it's financial support, and it's political support. It's very, very important. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  We never, ever forget friends and supporters of Ukraine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=384.96s)]
*  Finally, what would your message be to President Putin after what he did to your city? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  President Putin, I actually, it's difficult to tell him, to say to him something. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=400.4s)]
*  President Putin seek with idea to rebuild empire. They don't pay attention [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  for human lives, children's lives. They don't pay attention for the blood, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=420.56s)]
*  for millions of refugees and destroy the cities and villages. They seek. Seek with crazy idea. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=428.16s)]
*  It's not normal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=440.0s)]
*  We have the same religion, almost the same languages. We have almost the same history, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=444.64s)]
*  but the idea, seek idea, destroy relationship between two countries and bring instability [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=452.32s)]
*  in whole Europe, instability in the world. And right now, Putin sit in the corner. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=464.96s)]
*  He can't explain to the people, it was my mistake. It was mistake. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=478.24s)]
*  He have a dream to occupy Ukraine in couple of days, and they expect the Ukrainian people [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=485.84s)]
*  will be very happy to see Russian soldier. It's a sick illusion. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=494.88s)]
*  To tell to Russian people, it was my mistake, and Russians [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=504.8s)]
*  country pay for these mistakes. So huge price. Thousands, thousands, thousands of people killed. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=519.2s)]
*  And that's why I guess Putin will be keeping the power until his last day. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=526.4s)]
*  Well, just a few hours before I spoke to Vitaly Klitschko yesterday, there was a huge and deadly [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  attack here in Kiev, the deadliest in nine months. And he had been that morning in the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=550.32s)]
*  rubble of that attack. And even as those conversations about a ceasefire are going on at the highest [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=556.24s)]
*  level between Washington and Kiev and Moscow, those attacks are continuing. Another one in the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=560.72s)]
*  early hours of this morning in the city of Pavlerad, drone attack, which the authorities say [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  killed three people, one of them a child, injured 16 more, they say. One patient is seriously ill, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=571.76s)]
*  more of them are in, they describe it as moderate condition in hospital. But these attacks, they [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=580.8s)]
*  continue, they continue every day. And that is why these conversations are being had here in Ukraine [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=587.28s)]
*  about how President Zelensky could and should approach those continuing conversations that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=593.76s)]
*  are happening with Washington. And really, as you hear President Zelensky on the world stage, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=599.6s)]
*  really calling for more support for this country, which continues to be attacked, ruthlessly attacked, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=604.0s)]
*  mercilessly attacked, as you saw and heard there by Russia, even as those ceasefire conversations [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=610.24s)]
*  are continuing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NFnk4vFtb0&t=615.28s)]
