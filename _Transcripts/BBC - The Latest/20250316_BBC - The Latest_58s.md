# Fifty-one dead after North Macedonia nightclub fire. #Macedonia #Shorts #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw)
*  So the band DNK were performing at the Pulse nightclub in Cochene that attracted a really big crowd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=0.0s)]
*  Some reports saying around 1500 people were inside the club at the time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=7.0s)]
*  And there's been footage posted on social media and on the Macedonian news sites about what's been happening inside the nightclub. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=12.0s)]
*  You can see the footage of flames across the ceiling. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=20.0s)]
*  People, quite possibly staff at the nightclub, attempting to put out those flames with fire extinguishers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=23.0s)]
*  And then you get shots from outside the nightclub and you can see that the entire building is entirely engulfed with flames. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=30.0s)]
*  And you can hear the sound of the flames and the building burning as well in those videos. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=37.0s)]
*  So it's quite a horrendous sight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=41.0s)]
*  And in terms of the number of injuries, the initial reports coming in from Cochene were that they had admitted 90 people to the local hospital. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=43.0s)]
*  And they've since been transferring people to the capital, Skopje, because there's a number of severe burns, as you can imagine, and people have been injured. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmcIfSZKMVw&t=50.0s)]
