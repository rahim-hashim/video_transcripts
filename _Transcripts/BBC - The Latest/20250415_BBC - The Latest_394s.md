# US Vice-President JD Vance says 'good chance' of trade deal with UK | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4)
*  The US Vice President JD Vance has raised hopes of a UK-US trade deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr Vance said that the Trump administration wanted an agreement that would serve the best interest of both countries. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=5.36s)]
*  It's understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs and cover elements of trade in both goods and services. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=12.36s)]
*  Well, UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Here's our North America correspondent David Willis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=27.16s)]
*  This was JD Vance's first major interview with a European outlet since he took office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=30.16s)]
*  And in it, he made clear the Trump administration's affection for the UK government and its royal family in particular. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=36.28s)]
*  And he made clear that when it came to negotiating trade deals, the United Kingdom was at the front of the queue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=44.96s)]
*  We're working very hard with Keir Starmer's government, he said, adding that there was, as he put it, a good chance that the world's largest economy, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=53.08s)]
*  the United States, will reach a trade agreement with the UK that is in the best interest of both countries. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=62.0s)]
*  And despite declaring that he loves Europe, JD Vance made clear that he holds Europe's leaders, most of them anyway, in considerably less affection. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=70.16s)]
*  And that with the exception of Britain, Poland and France, a lack of military spending had threatened to leave European nations, as he put it, security vassals. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=81.0s)]
*  David Willis there. Well, Sarah Jones is Minister for Industry. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=94.8s)]
*  She gave this update earlier on how steel and coal has been getting to Scunthorpe to keep the blast furnaces going. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=97.92s)]
*  She was also commenting on the potential trade deal between the United States and the UK. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=105.8s)]
*  Well, we've got officials on the ground. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=112.56s)]
*  We've got new leadership in British Steel itself. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=114.88s)]
*  We've paid the bills for the shipments. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=119.52s)]
*  So we are in a steady state now, and I'm reassured about that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=124.6s)]
*  And people can be reassured that that steady state is there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=130.28s)]
*  Of course, what we need to look to the future, we need to work out what we're going to do in terms of steel production in the UK going forward. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=134.48s)]
*  Now, there is huge positive news in that the demand for steel is increasing, whether it's the 1.5 million homes that we'll be building, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  whether it's Heathrow expansion, the new theme park in Bedford, whether it's clean energy, all of these new infrastructures need steel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  So we need to make sure through our 2.5 billion pound fund for steel, which we had in the manifesto, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  that we are delivering the right conditions for the steel industry in the UK to thrive. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=167.0s)]
*  It's halved over the last 10 years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=171.92s)]
*  Our steel production in this country has halved. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  We have to reverse that decline, and I'm positive that we'll be able to do that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=176.72s)]
*  Well, that's you know, I'm not going to comment on those conversations that my colleagues are having. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Of course, Johnny Reynolds, the business secretary, has had lots of conversations with his counterparts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  Our officials are having lots of conversations as well, and I'm hoping for a good outcome as we all are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  But I don't want to preempt that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, it's positive, of course, that the vice president is suggesting that we're close to a deal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  But those conversations will continue until we get there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Sarah Jones there, Minister for Industry, talking about the potential trade deal between the US and the UK, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  but also talking about Scunthorpe. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=216.88s)]
*  And we will be coming back to that a little bit later in the programme, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=218.44s)]
*  because we're hopeful that our raw materials will be coming to the plant. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=222.0s)]
*  But let's just pick up on what JD Vance, the US in the United States, was talking about when it comes to potential trade deals. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  We can cross over to speak to Antonin Finkelberg, director general of the Federation for German Wholesale and Foreign Trade. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=235.48s)]
*  JD Vance saying that a reciprocal relationship between the US and the UK gave Britain a more advantageous position than other European countries. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=243.76s)]
*  He said that the US loves the Germans, but you are heavily dependent on exporting to the US. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=254.12s)]
*  But you've been really tough on a lot of American businesses. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=261.12s)]
*  So is that a fair assessment from JD Vance? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=264.76s)]
*  No, I think it's a fair assessment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=268.64s)]
*  I think there's a trade surplus from Germany and from Europe to the United States on normal exports. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=271.32s)]
*  But there's also a big surplus from service companies, especially digital companies from the US going to Europe and to Germany. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=278.11999999999995s)]
*  So if you put those two things on the table, the balance is a lot more closer to being normal than what has been said. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  We know that, of course, the UK had 10 percent tariffs put on them, whereas the European Union had 20 percent tariffs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=294.44s)]
*  Obviously, the UK not part of the EU anymore. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=301.52s)]
*  Do you think that Brexit was good for the UK in this particular circumstance? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=305.32s)]
*  I don't think so, because the EU is back to the 10 percent as well. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=311.84s)]
*  And the EU is much larger market. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=315.92s)]
*  So normally that would give us a better negotiation position. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=318.64s)]
*  However, you cannot dismiss the historical connection between England and the United States and the UK and the United States. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=322.52s)]
*  Therefore, I think it's a lot of different reasons playing in that current state of negotiations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=329.96s)]
*  Do you wonder whether Ursula von der Leyen came in too strong at the very beginning of this, saying that they will be putting reciprocal tariffs on the United States? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=335.84s)]
*  There was a lot of fighting talk coming from the European Union. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=345.4s)]
*  Was that the wrong way to go about dealing with someone like Donald Trump? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think so. In this case, I think the response by the EU, by Mrs von der Leyen was quite right, actually. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=354.0s)]
*  We never got the impression that the United States actually wanted to really negotiate. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=361.04s)]
*  Therefore, we needed a hard answer and a strong stance to actually get them to open the negotiations. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=365.92s)]
*  And now I think we're seeing a more measured response. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=373.56s)]
*  The EU is pulling back its tariffs, a threat of additional tariffs for the moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=376.52s)]
*  So we have an open window of our country's travel. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=381.4s)]
*  So that's a good thing in our opinion. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  OK, great to get your assessment. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=387.68s)]
*  Antonin Finkelberg from the Federation for German Wholesale and Foreign Trade. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBPkg1azE4&t=393.0s)]
