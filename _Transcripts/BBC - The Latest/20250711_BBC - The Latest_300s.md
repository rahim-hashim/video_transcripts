# Bosnia and Herzegovina mark 30 years since Srebrenica massacre | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ)
*  Bosnia and Herzegovina is marking the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  when around 8,000 people, mostly Bosnian Muslim men and boys, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=6.0s)]
*  were systematically murdered by Bosnian Serb forces. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=11.0s)]
*  It was Europe's worst atrocity since the Second World War. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, our correspondent Guy Delaunay is at Srebrenica at the memorial. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=20.0s)]
*  This is Potocari Cemetery, and this is opposite the Srebrenica Memorial Center, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=26.0s)]
*  where the killing started, really. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=32.0s)]
*  And these days the Srebrenica Memorial Center is a museum. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=34.0s)]
*  It's got a lot of exhibits connected with the massacre, a lot of documentation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=38.0s)]
*  And right at this moment there is a commemoration ceremony going on in there with a lot of dignitaries. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=42.0s)]
*  But behind here you can see all of the gravestones of the people who've been buried at Potocari Cemetery. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=47.0s)]
*  And they're among the 8,000 people who were murdered during the Srebrenica massacre. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=53.0s)]
*  And among these graves have been seven graves freshly dug, ready for today's commemoration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=59.0s)]
*  And that's because seven people have been identified over the past year as victims of the Srebrenica massacre. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=67.0s)]
*  And they will be laid to rest today in a funeral ceremony. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=74.0s)]
*  And that's going to be the heart of these commemorations, that every year we've got a few more people identified [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=78.0s)]
*  and laid to rest in Potocari Cemetery. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=84.0s)]
*  And it means that their families can find some sort of peace at last. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=87.0s)]
*  But as you can see, tens of thousands of people are coming here to pay their respects. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=92.0s)]
*  It's not just important for the family members of the victims of the Srebrenica massacre, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=96.0s)]
*  but an awful lot of other people in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well want to remember. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=100.0s)]
*  The phrase is remember Srebrenica. You see that everywhere. People do want to remember. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=105.0s)]
*  Guy Delaney there. Well, let's speak to Dr. Jasmine Mujanovic, Senior Fellow at the New Line Institute. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=109.0s)]
*  That's a think tank based in Washington, DC, specialising in the Western Balkans. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=117.0s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. We saw there some of the commemorations today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=122.0s)]
*  How is this anniversary viewed across the spectrum? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Well, for Bosnia Herzegovina, the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=133.0s)]
*  because of course it was a genocide, not merely a massacre, is a deeply, deeply important occasion. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=138.0s)]
*  It signifies, of course, the apex horror of a broader genocide that was committed against the Bosniak people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=145.0s)]
*  during the aggression on Bosnia Herzegovina by the then regime in Belgrade under Slobodan Milošević between 1992-1995. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=151.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are still dealing with a great deal of systematic denial and negationism on the part of governing authorities [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=158.0s)]
*  and the RS entity in Bosnia Herzegovina as well as the government of Serbia. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=165.0s)]
*  But for most people in B.I.H., this is a moment of remembrance. This is a moment of mourning. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=170.0s)]
*  But it is also a moment of resilience. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=177.0s)]
*  You say there, in some entities and some areas, people still refuse to accept that this happened then? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=180.0s)]
*  That's right. Unfortunately, in the smaller entity in Bosnia Herzegovina, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=188.0s)]
*  which is unfortunately where most of the Serb populace lives today, as well as in Serbia, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=192.0s)]
*  we still have a very hard-line political commitment to negationism, to revisionism, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=201.0s)]
*  and also increasingly unfortunately to genocide triumphalism. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=208.0s)]
*  So what we've seen over the last few years is not merely that the facts of the genocide in Bosnia Herzegovina and Serbia are denied [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=211.0s)]
*  by authorities in Belgrade and Banja Luka, but in fact that the perpetrators are celebrated and glorified. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=217.0s)]
*  And so 30 years on, what do you think needs to change to try and unite what remains a divided area over this? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=223.0s)]
*  Well, there is a categorical commitment on the part of the people of Bosnia Herzegovina to build a better future for themselves. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=233.0s)]
*  This obviously requires greater assistance on the part of, in particular, the European Union, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=241.0s)]
*  but the international community more broadly, in particular to bring Bosnia Herzegovina's constitutional regime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=245.0s)]
*  in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as binding rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=250.0s)]
*  We still have one of the most hard-line sectarian regimes, a deeply illiberal regime in Bosnia Herzegovina, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=258.0s)]
*  and it is very difficult to imagine lasting peace and reconciliation taking place under such circumstances. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=264.0s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on that story, Jasmine Mujanovic, speaking to us from the New Line Institute in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=270.0s)]
*  I think we can take you to live images as the remembrance continues on. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=281.0s)]
*  Those images there, of course, marking three decades on since the Srebrenica massacre. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRGSgNY-VBQ&t=288.0s)]
