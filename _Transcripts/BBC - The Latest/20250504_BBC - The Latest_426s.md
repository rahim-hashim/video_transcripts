# Does President Trump actually want to make Canada the 51st state? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk)
*  Is President Trump actually obsessed with Canada? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=0.0s)]
*  He said he wants Canada to be part of the US, slapped tariffs on it, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=2.4s)]
*  and annoyed a load of Canadians in the process. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=5.76s)]
*  So what is it about Canada and what's his end goal? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=8.08s)]
*  So on the surface, the US and Canada have always had a pretty friendly relationship. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=10.8s)]
*  After all, Canada only borders the US. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=14.4s)]
*  If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=16.56s)]
*  Just a straight artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago. Makes no sense. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=19.68s)]
*  The border between the US and Canada is the longest between two countries in the whole world. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=25.36s)]
*  It's 8,891 kilometres long. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=29.84s)]
*  It took a long time to finalise where it should be drawn, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=32.96s)]
*  and in a little-known treaty in 1908, it was finally confirmed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  The US has actually tried to invade Canada before, more than once, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=39.68s)]
*  but both failed attempts were ages ago, and for centuries now, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=43.04s)]
*  the relationship between the two has been good. Great, even. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=46.4s)]
*  America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbour like Canada. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=49.36s)]
*  So what's been done to damage it, then? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=52.96s)]
*  US President Donald Trump's return to the White House led to the biggest shift [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=54.56s)]
*  between the two countries in decades. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=58.56s)]
*  At first, people literally thought he was joking when he suggested that Canada [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=60.56s)]
*  could become part of America, but he's said it a lot since then. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=67.04s)]
*  As a state, it would be one of the great states anyway. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=69.68s)]
*  This would be the most incredible country visually. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=72.48s)]
*  His territorial views, that's never, ever going to happen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=75.12s)]
*  But besides all the talk, what has he actually changed? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  So remember when he was slapping these huge taxes on imports from other countries? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=83.28s)]
*  He's put steep tariffs of 25% on Canada then, although he did later take them back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=87.36s)]
*  In March, he made it so that Canadians have to go through immigration control [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  if they want to access the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=95.68s)]
*  which lies across the Vermont-Quebec part of the border. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=98.64s)]
*  It used to be open to residents from both nations, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=101.36s)]
*  and it's always been seen as this symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=103.68s)]
*  So who came up with this agenda? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=107.44s)]
*  The latest US and Canada fallout has been covered in this piece [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=109.36s)]
*  from our North America correspondent, Anthony Zurcher. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=112.08s)]
*  How long has Donald Trump been expressing an interest in taking over Canada? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=114.72s)]
*  He brings it up over and over again. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=120.32s)]
*  There was one point where I asked him a question about trade with the UK, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=122.16s)]
*  and he pivoted and started talking about Canada. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=126.64s)]
*  Canada has huge supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=129.44s)]
*  The kind of natural wealth that some people say President Trump is after, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=135.68s)]
*  including Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=139.36s)]
*  The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=141.92s)]
*  America is not Canada. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=147.92s)]
*  And Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Although President Trump says that's not the case. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=156.56s)]
*  We don't need their lumber. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  We don't need their energy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=160.64s)]
*  We have more than they do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=161.76s)]
*  We don't need anything. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=162.88s)]
*  Geographically, they occupy, obviously, an area that borders on the Arctic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  The Arctic could become a much more important region as global warming continues to move forward. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  And it sounds like Canadians have pretty strong views on any discussions about becoming American. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=176.56s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=181.44s)]
*  Not a chance. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=183.44s)]
*  Yes, I could. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=184.08s)]
*  No. No, not at all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=184.8s)]
*  So what is it actually about then? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=186.32s)]
*  How do we know what the President is actually thinking behind closed doors? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=188.08s)]
*  I talked with John Bolton, who is Donald Trump's national security adviser, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  and he did say Donald Trump fixates on ideas, that things get into his head. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  But there is no kind of a cohesive ideology behind there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=199.12s)]
*  The President doesn't really think that way and someone else could get in his ear sometime later. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=203.6s)]
*  So if he really does mean it, if US territorial ambitions for Canada are real, then why? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=208.96s)]
*  The US and Canada have had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=214.96s)]
*  for more than 100 years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  So why would the US put all of that at risk? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=222.0s)]
*  I posed the question to Michael Williams, who is a professor at the University of Canada. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=224.24s)]
*  And he said that Donald Trump's designs on Canada almost represent a kind of a 19th century [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=229.84s)]
*  geopolitical outlook where the United States is not the one big global power anymore. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=236.56s)]
*  It's one of many global powers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  And as one of many global powers, it should focus more of its time and effort on securing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=243.68s)]
*  its immediate geographic region. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  And so that includes Canada. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=253.04s)]
*  You secure the areas around you, you consolidate your borders and your immediate region, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=254.88s)]
*  and you use that as your base of power in interacting with China and Russia and Europe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=260.96s)]
*  and whoever else. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=266.4s)]
*  If you listen to some of the people around Donald Trump, people like Secretary of State [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=267.36s)]
*  Marco Rubio, he came right out and said that it was kind of a weird quirk of the Cold War [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=270.8s)]
*  that the United States was this one superpower. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=276.4s)]
*  What's a much more stable traditional kind of a geopolitical balance is that the United [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=279.28s)]
*  States is just one of many powers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  OK, what now then? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  Where do we stand at the moment? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=287.44s)]
*  We already know Canadians have been boycotting US products and cancelling their holidays [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=288.55999999999995s)]
*  there off the back of these tariffs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  And we know Canada's new Prime Minister, who we mentioned earlier, thinks the trust between [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  the US and Canada has already been broken. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  There was a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership to be had. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=300.4s)]
*  It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=304.32s)]
*  So Canada's not the only place Trump is interested in, by the way. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=306.56s)]
*  He's already spoken about Greenland and the Panama Canal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=309.2s)]
*  He ruled out using force in their cases, but he did say he'd consider using economic force [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=312.08s)]
*  to influence Canada. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=316.48s)]
*  How unprecedented is this? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=317.68s)]
*  Is it a new idea that a Prime Minister or a President could just say, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=320.8s)]
*  I want to take that bit of land and I want it as my own? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=325.28s)]
*  It's much more a kind of a 19th century, as I mentioned, way of looking at things where [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=327.76s)]
*  borders were movable. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=333.44s)]
*  That was kind of the way things were done before. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=336.16s)]
*  But for instance, when Russia invaded Ukraine just a few years ago, the United States was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=338.48s)]
*  leading the push to say no, Russia can't expand its borders this way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=343.6s)]
*  Territorial acquisition is a violation of international law. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=348.8s)]
*  Now you see Donald Trump talk about in negotiations with Russia, maybe allowing them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  to take some of Ukraine's territory and Donald Trump himself eyeing territory that the United [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=358.0s)]
*  States might want to take. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=363.68s)]
*  So it is a return to a different way of ordering the world, one that the United States has [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=365.28s)]
*  not advocated for 100 years. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=371.11999999999995s)]
*  Combining Canada with the US would basically double its size and make it larger than Russia [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=373.44s)]
*  and twice the size of China. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  So any idea of expansion or unification would be seen as a direct threat by both of those [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=380.0s)]
*  countries. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  So it's not just opposition from the Canadians that the administration needs to think about, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  but the whole world. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you think his chances are of being able to redraw the border in the way that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  he wants to? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=393.76s)]
*  I think it's still unlikely. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  Expanding the US territory, that would be a historic accomplishment, one that when people [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=397.84s)]
*  look at Canada or Greenland as part of the United States could say, well, Donald Trump [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=403.11999999999995s)]
*  did that, his own monument, kind of a geographic monument to his presidency. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=408.0s)]
*  While it may not be likely that tanks will roll across the border into Canada, they do [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=414.4s)]
*  have to take American designs on Canadian territories and resources seriously. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ61vztOWXk&t=420.32s)]
