*  exclusive contract with their agency, Adore, which then led to a legal battle. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvWNiZpP38&t=17.36s)]

*  blocking the members' independent activities. I was obviously expecting the alternative results [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvWNiZpP38&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  but yeah, so I think it was like a moment where we were all really just like kind of in shock. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvWNiZpP38&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  Adore stated that it is deeply regretful that the members performed under a name other than New Genes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvWNiZpP38&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  and unilaterally announced a halt to their activities. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvWNiZpP38&t=67.84s)]
