Video Description: British Steel is launching a consultation that could see the closure of its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, in England, putting up to 2,700 jobs at risk out of a workforce of 3,500.
 
The company said the blast furnaces were "no longer financially sustainable" due to tough market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs.
 
The BBC understands British Steel was expecting a £1bn injection of government money to keep the business going, but was offered £500m.
 
The Prime Minister's official spokesperson said the government had made a "generous offer" to British Steel and it would continue to work with the company and its Chinese owner Jingye to secure its future.

# Thousands of jobs at risk as British Steel threatens closure | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM)
*  The Chinese owner of British Steel has this morning rejected a state rescue package [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=0.0s)]
*  which was proposed to safeguard thousands of jobs at a plant in Scunthorpe. The business secretary [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=5.28s)]
*  Jonathan Rennell said the government's 500 million pound offer on Monday was rejected by the Singhy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=10.48s)]
*  Group since it falls well short say the company of what they are looking for. The question is what [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  that means for the future of the plant. In the last hour Sarah Jones the industry minister gave [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=24.0s)]
*  this statement to the house. In the immediate term we must support the people who work at British [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=29.52s)]
*  Steel. Our contingency plans have kicked in to ensure all possible support is made available [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=35.12s)]
*  to British Steel's workforce. Both the DWP and the DFE will have teams on the ground [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=41.12s)]
*  shortly to engage with employees for as long as necessary. Indeed we have asked British [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=48.32s)]
*  Steel that officials are given direct access to British Steel sites to bring their support as [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=53.6s)]
*  close as possible to affected workers. Right so we've got a statement then from the government [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=59.12s)]
*  let's get some reaction from Scunthorpe. Our reporter there is Phil McCann he is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=66.8s)]
*  has been speaking to Charlotte Brumpton-Charles from the GB Union who is in talks with British [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=72.24s)]
*  Steel's management. Well this site behind me is home to the last two remaining blast furnaces in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=77.36s)]
*  the UK mass producing steel. What is not clear is whether today's announcement is the beginning [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=84.4s)]
*  of the end for this site or whether it is deal making brinkmanship. The BBC understands that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  the operators of this place, Jingay, were expecting a £1 billion injection of government money to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  keep the business going and to be able to afford to build two new electric arc furnaces. The [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  government we understand has offered half of that and the response from British Steel has been to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=106.48s)]
*  launch a consultation on jobs. Charlotte Brumpton-Charles is from the GMB trade union, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=110.48s)]
*  just tell me first of all what you make of this announcement today. It is obviously extremely [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  worrying news. The multi-union plan that we have prepared with Syndex offers an alternative [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=119.44s)]
*  solution than the three that have been put forward by the company today. We should be protecting and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  maintaining steel making here in Scunthorpe. As you say these are the last two blast furnaces [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  in the country. There is a question over national security as well as the devastation that that would [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=134.4s)]
*  impact on the community here in Scunthorpe. Who is calling the ball in now? Is it British Steel or [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=139.28s)]
*  is it the government to offer more? I think there needs to be movement on both sides here. We are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=144.16s)]
*  now calling for meetings with DBT and Treasury to go through the multi-union plan in depth and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=150.72s)]
*  offer the alternative solution needed to protect steel making and jobs here in Scunthorpe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much Charlotte. We heard today's decision, if it goes through, would mean the end [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=161.04s)]
*  effectively of mass-produced steel making in the UK. British Steel for its part has said that it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=166.56s)]
*  believes this announcement today is a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=171.44s)]
*  that the business faces. So that's the view from Scunthorpe. With me in the studio is our [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=177.12s)]
*  employment correspondent Zoe Conway. What do you think is going on here? Well British Steel are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=181.6s)]
*  talking about three options. The blast furnaces and steel making operations close by June or [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=188.08s)]
*  they delay that to September, presumably with a bit of help to keep it open. Or tantalisingly [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=195.28s)]
*  they're talking about it staying open beyond that and they're also saying that they want to talk [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=203.52s)]
*  about options with the government. So the word brinkmanship is being used I think with some [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=210.08s)]
*  justification. What's really going on here? Now what we do know is that the company has put forward [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=216.32s)]
*  a two billion pound plan for its future, a business plan. This is partly about helping it to decarbonise [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=222.8s)]
*  and the BBC understands that there was an expectation that the government would meet [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  half of that, so a billion pounds. Now what we also know is that what has been put on the table [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=237.28s)]
*  by the government is 500 million pounds and that's been rejected. So what is going on here? Is there [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=242.72000000000003s)]
*  now a giant haggle that's going to go on between ministers and the company? This is a company that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=247.6s)]
*  is losing money by its own admission every day. What the minister said in parliament a short time [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=254.4s)]
*  ago was that they had put conditions on the company, conditions had to be met and she said [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=261.76s)]
*  they hadn't been met. Now we don't know all the detail about that but I can say that what I'm [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=268.0s)]
*  being told is that this one billion figure was being discussed by the business and by the unions [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=272.64s)]
*  this morning. Right, just looking at her statement which has just popped up in front of me, she's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=279.44s)]
*  saying it has to safeguard as many jobs as possible and ensure the company's long-term commercial [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=285.12s)]
*  viability. They must provide the commitments we need and which taxpayers would quite rightly [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=292.0s)]
*  Is there a question mark over the viability of this switch to electric arc furnaces, the green [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  alternative? Well yesterday the chief commercial officer for British Steel gave evidence to the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  Business and Trade Select Committee and he was talking about this switch to decarbonisation and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  he was putting this two billion pound price tag on it so it's incredibly expensive. Now we know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  the government's got a 2.5 billion pound steel fund. What I thought was really interesting in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=320.0s)]
*  the Commons was that we had the deputy leader of reform Richard Tice calling on the government to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=324.96s)]
*  nationalise the scunthorpe plant, the minister didn't rule it out and I think the bigger context [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=330.4s)]
*  here which I think is really interesting is the issue about defence. Do we need these steel plants [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=336.8s)]
*  for strategic reasons for our defence? At the moment this plant is not providing lots of steel [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=342.96s)]
*  for the defence industry, it's more likely to provide steel for our rail lines but I think [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=347.76s)]
*  that's the context and that's certainly what MPs are talking about in Westminster at the moment [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=353.68s)]
*  is just the strategic importance of this. When you mentioned the two billion figure it suddenly [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=358.32s)]
*  occurred to me having been down at Westminster yesterday for the spring statement that there was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=363.92s)]
*  one of the growth elements of the package yesterday was that they're going to inject [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=369.44s)]
*  the same figure two billion pounds into capital investment in the country. Is there a feeling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=373.68s)]
*  within the steel community that they are a major part of the growth agenda and should be getting [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=378.8s)]
*  some of that money? Well certainly the unions would make that point that this is incredibly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=383.12s)]
*  important for the economy, that this steel is used in construction but I think that it's also [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=388.32s)]
*  about the livelihoods of people who consider that they've got incredibly good jobs, these are good [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=396.48s)]
*  jobs and this is a source of pride for a lot of people so this isn't just about numbers and it [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=403.68s)]
*  isn't just about strategic interest, it's also about people and I think that that's what we're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=409.76s)]
*  going to be hearing a lot about today is this whole community now on edge. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LRSUlmPTM&t=415.36s)]
