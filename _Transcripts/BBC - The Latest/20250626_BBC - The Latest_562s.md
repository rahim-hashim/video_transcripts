Video Description: Warning: Contains descriptions of sexual exploitation
This BBC investigation reveals exploitation and abuse in the booming global webcam sex industry, where live sexual performances are streamed to millions of men worldwide. 
With nearly 15 billion views across major platforms last year, the demand is enormous - and so are the consequences. 
In countries like Colombia, where webcamming can be a lucrative option amid poverty, models share disturbing experiences: streaming from cramped cubicles, being fined for toilet breaks, coerced into degrading acts, and in some cases, recruited as minors. 
This story offers rare access and powerful first-hand accounts, exposing the darker realities of one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global sex industry.

# Inside Colombiaâ€™s booming sexcam industry | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo)
*  Hi! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=0.0s)]
*  Adult webcam modelling, a booming industry estimated to be worth billions of dollars. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=5.0s)]
*  Welcome to my show! Nice to meet you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=11.0s)]
*  Now, Colombia has overtaken Romania as the country with the highest number of models. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=14.0s)]
*  Here, hundreds of thousands of women are streaming live sexual acts to men all over the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=20.0s)]
*  We revolutionise and improve the quality of life of thousands of women. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=27.0s)]
*  I earn monthly between $5,000 and sometimes even up to $10,000. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=33.0s)]
*  But at what cost? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=40.0s)]
*  There are 500,000 girls who are involved in these studies of slavery. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=42.0s)]
*  Is this a good way for Colombian women to earn money? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=48.0s)]
*  Or are they being exposed to new forms of digital exploitation? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=52.0s)]
*  Content can be explicit, it can be bollaristic, it can be about fetishes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=83.0s)]
*  I feel that the people who enter there don't have anyone to talk to, so they look for company in us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=91.0s)]
*  Most of these people come for content that is clearly explicit and sexual. Others don't. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=97.0s)]
*  Puky works independently, but many women choose to work in webcam studios, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=103.0s)]
*  which provide them with everything they need for their performances. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=109.0s)]
*  This is a webcam studio. There are thousands of them all over Colombia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=113.0s)]
*  In each of these rooms, a model is streaming adult content online for hours to men from all over the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=118.0s)]
*  The demand for this kind of content is huge and it's growing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=126.0s)]
*  Studios range from small, low-budget operations to large enterprises like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=132.0s)]
*  Father and son Juan Carlos and Anthony Rivera run a webcoming empire. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, so currently Colombia has become the number one country as far as number of models and number of studios. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=145.0s)]
*  This is an industry that has grown massively in the last few years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=153.0s)]
*  And it has transformed how adult content is consumed and monetized. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=158.0s)]
*  Between 2024 and 2025, the four largest webcam streaming platforms had more than 15 billion views. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=163.0s)]
*  The key component in our industry is the interaction, the interactivity. That's what really hooks the clients. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=172.0s)]
*  These financial opportunities are what every model we spoke with is drawn to, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=189.0s)]
*  in a country where nearly one-third of the population lives in poverty. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=195.0s)]
*  But we also had accounts of exploitation and abuse. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=204.0s)]
*  Sophie is among the women who told us about filming for up to 18 hours in cramped cubicles and fines for eating or going to the toilet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=218.0s)]
*  Sophie says the studio monitors who assist the models would make agreements with clients on her behalf. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=237.0s)]
*  One of them was being forced to do a sex act until she vomited. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=245.0s)]
*  The abuse in the industry is such that even the president of Colombia has recently spoken out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=260.0s)]
*  There are studios with bad practice that exploit their models. However, it is not the majority of studios. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=276.0s)]
*  There are managers who demand a lot from their models to make money, make money, make money. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=283.0s)]
*  We've heard testimony from women who were hired as children. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=290.0s)]
*  The studio's sidestepping age checks. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=294.0s)]
*  Kaynie says she's been webcombing since she was 17. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=297.0s)]
*  There are times when they ask for very strong things, like hurting yourself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=319.0s)]
*  Some people like it and they interpret it as children. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=324.0s)]
*  If I was a minor, I wouldn't recommend starting in that world. I was too young. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=331.0s)]
*  To present myself as a studio in front of the platforms, I only have to deliver my work. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=349.0s)]
*  To present myself as a studio in front of the platforms, I only have to deliver my work. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=357.0s)]
*  I think they don't do enough in that sense. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=365.0s)]
*  We've collected evidence of studios operating in 23 countries all over the world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=388.0s)]
*  And we've uncovered that these four companies, who have faced accusations of not doing enough to address abusers, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=395.0s)]
*  have links to webcam studios in at least 11 of these countries, from India to South Africa to the US. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=403.0s)]
*  Some studios use fake IDs to slot in models. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=417.0s)]
*  We spoke to a woman who streamed on BongoCamps, your platform, and she was under 18. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=422.0s)]
*  Do you think that's problematic? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=429.0s)]
*  So we make sure that on camera she looks like an adult, and she looks like a teenager. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=430.0s)]
*  And then we make sure that she looks like a teenager. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=435.0s)]
*  And then we make sure that she looks like a teenager. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=438.0s)]
*  And then we make sure that she looks like a teenager. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=441.0s)]
*  So we make sure that on camera she looks like an adult. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=444.0s)]
*  That's really hard though, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty hard, but we check IDs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=449.0s)]
*  Even before approving the account, we still check IDs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=451.0s)]
*  Chattabait and StripChat told us they are committed to a safe working environment. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=454.0s)]
*  Chattabait says they have categorically stopped efforts to use fake IDs, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=460.0s)]
*  and models are required to regularly submit live images of themselves for verification. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=465.0s)]
*  StripChat told us they have a dedicated in-house moderation team that operates 24-7 [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=473.0s)]
*  to prevent underage models broadcasting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=479.0s)]
*  They also told us they've updated key rules, including obligations for studios [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=482.0s)]
*  to ensure safe and comfortable working conditions for models. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=488.0s)]
*  Chattabait, StripChat and BongoCamps told us they are not direct employers, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=492.0s)]
*  and therefore don't intervene in the terms set between studios and models. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=498.0s)]
*  And Live Jasmine did not respond to us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=503.0s)]
*  The reality is that the demand for webcam content is enormous, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=508.0s)]
*  and attempts to shut it down are unlikely to succeed. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=513.0s)]
*  The solution of that would not be to shut down the industry or to shut down these platforms. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=517.0s)]
*  It would be addressing potential responsibilities that a platform could take, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=522.0s)]
*  potential ways in which they can work in fairer ways. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=528.0s)]
*  This is a complex industry. For some women, it brings independence, income, even empowerment. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=531.0s)]
*  For others, the money they earn comes at a heavy emotional cost. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=543.0s)]
*  I don't see myself in that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRMus9bouo&t=552.0s)]
