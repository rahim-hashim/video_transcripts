Video Description: Thailand is trying to rein in its free-wheeling marijuana market.
 
Its government has approved new measures that went into effect on Wednesday restricting the sale of the drug to those with a doctor's prescription, in the hope of helping regulate an industry some describe as out of control.
 
The south-east Asian nation's public health minister has also said that consumption of marijuana will be criminalised again, although it's unclear when that could happen.
 
Ever since the drug was decriminalised in 2022, there has been a frenzy of investment. There are now around 11,000 registered cannabis dispensaries in Thailand.
 
So far this year, 173 people accused of smuggling cannabis – nearly all from Thailand – have gone through the court system in the UK and received sentences totalling 230 years.

# Thailand's 'weed wild west' faces new rules as smuggling to UK rises | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE)
*  Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, one of Asia's busiest, and these customs officers are on the lookout. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=0.0s)]
*  Every day they get tip-offs, and it's nearly always young travellers with large new suitcases that they stop. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=8.0s)]
*  When they're opened, more often than not the customs officers find vacuum-sealed packages of marijuana, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=16.0s)]
*  grown in Thailand but destined for the UK. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=23.0s)]
*  We're now in one of several rooms where Thai customs keep suitcases that they've confiscated from mainly British travellers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=27.0s)]
*  We've been told there are around 200 here, all filled with marijuana. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=34.0s)]
*  That's probably around three tonnes taken in just the past month. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=39.0s)]
*  But these days there are so few regulations governing the production and distribution of marijuana in Thailand [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=42.0s)]
*  that those trying to take these cases out of the country face either very light penalties or no punishment at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=48.0s)]
*  It's a different story though when they leave Thailand. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=55.0s)]
*  Last month two British women were detained in Sri Lanka and Georgia, accused of carrying large amounts of Thai cannabis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=59.0s)]
*  Hundreds more have been arrested in Britain over the past year after coming back from Thailand with marijuana in their luggage. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=66.0s)]
*  They now face years in prison. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=74.0s)]
*  Some of these couriers are exploited, some of them are vulnerable, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=77.0s)]
*  and they're not considering the life-changing consequences for something they think is a low-risk issue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=81.0s)]
*  Do you think the couriers don't understand this, how serious it is if they get caught? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=87.0s)]
*  I don't think that they appreciate the risk until it's too late. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=92.0s)]
*  Thailand's decision three years ago to decriminalise marijuana set off an uncontrolled boom, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=96.0s)]
*  with dispensaries popping up on every street corner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=103.0s)]
*  Prices collapsed and the smuggling syndicates moved in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=107.0s)]
*  Now the Thai government has decided to act. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=112.0s)]
*  Last month the Health Minister promised that soon using marijuana will require a medical certificate with more regulations to come. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=115.0s)]
*  But just how easy is it to buy large quantities of marijuana here? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=124.0s)]
*  I decided to find out at this gathering of local growers who've been protesting against the proposed new regulations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=129.0s)]
*  Khemboi, if I wanted to buy 46 kilos of marijuana, could I just come to your farm and you just supply it to me? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=136.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=143.0s)]
*  Turns out it's not easy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=144.0s)]
*  This grower showed me the licence he needs to sell his crop and then only to licence shops. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=146.0s)]
*  He can't sell directly to British backpackers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=152.0s)]
*  What's needed, say those who've campaigned for decriminalisation, is not more regulations, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=156.0s)]
*  but action against the many unlicensed growers who flooded the Thai market with cheap marijuana. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=162.0s)]
*  If they just follow their own existing rules and enforce those rules, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=169.0s)]
*  we would probably mitigate a lot of the issue that they have right now, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=176.0s)]
*  which is the smuggling going outside and then also in terms of licensing our sale without the licence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=181.0s)]
*  So is this the end of Thailand's free-wheeling weed experiment? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=190.0s)]
*  No one really knows yet. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=195.0s)]
*  But what is clear is the original dream of a new industry of idealistic local cultivators has turned sour. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=197.0s)]
*  And now with pressure from countries like Britain, the government wants to rein it in. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdqD3bYYIkE&t=205.0s)]
