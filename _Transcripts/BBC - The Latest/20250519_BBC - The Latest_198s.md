# Israel launches major offensive across Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY)
*  Let's turn to the Middle East because Israel says it will allow a limited amount of food into Gaza ending a 78-day blockade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=0.0s)]
*  The decision comes after pressure from the United States further Israeli ground operations have also taken place today across Gaza with deadly airstrikes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=7.22s)]
*  Continuing hospitals say at least a hundred people including dozens of children have been killed in the last 24 hours [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=16.42s)]
*  Let's go to the border between southern Israel and Gaza our Middle East correspondent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=22.94s)]
*  We're a Davises there and we're adjusting the last few moments the Israeli military has said five trucks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=27.98s)]
*  Carrying aid have entered Gaza, but of course as the UN chief also saying that it's simply a drop in the ocean [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=33.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean five trucks carrying aid there apparently baby food and other vital aid it is a drop in the ocean [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=43.06s)]
*  UN spokeswoman told me this morning that five to six hundred trucks a day would be needed to even start to alleviate and address [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=50.78s)]
*  The problems of malnutrition and shortages that gaza's 2.1 million people face [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  So I think they'll be apart from laughing. This is a very serious matter five trucks are going to make absolutely no difference at all [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=64.54s)]
*  The UN has already hit back today saying that much more aid is needed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=72.42s)]
*  And that must be facilitated via the existing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=77.52s)]
*  UN staff and various UN bodies because that is the only way this aid is going to make a difference [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=81.16s)]
*  Earlier today we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=86.92s)]
*  He admitted that Israel has been widely criticized even by its closest ally the United States [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=90.0s)]
*  Israel was warned not to cross a red line and allow [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=96.72s)]
*  Starvation to be a big problem in Gaza [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=101.44s)]
*  but if [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu's answer is to allow as small as five trucks a day in and I don't think he can expect [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=104.96s)]
*  There not to be any more criticism. So perhaps Israel is intending to to wrap this up overcoming days [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=112.32s)]
*  But this is a very very small answer to what Gaza's overwhelming needs are and it won't satisfy his allies [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=118.28s)]
*  Internationally that's for sure. We're bringing up to date in terms of the military operation. We've been seeing for a number of days now [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=125.88s)]
*  Now you can probably hear in a distance [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=135.32s)]
*  We've been hearing and seeing all day the impact of Israeli artillery and airstrikes on Gaza much of northern Gaza behind me [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=137.2s)]
*  Bet Hanoum Gaza City, Jubalia. They've all been hit relentlessly throughout the day [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=145.56s)]
*  You can hear sometimes the smoke in the distance as those buildings are hit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=151.6s)]
*  What you can also see are the the trails of dust as Israeli armor moves towards Gaza City [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=156.6s)]
*  This is the start or the continuation if you like of operation Gideon's chariots [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=163.76s)]
*  It's Israel again according to Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=169.04s)]
*  Occupying the whole of Gaza. They're going to defeat Hamas completely. That is the Israeli military aim and a big [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=172.64s)]
*  Controversial part of that plan is to move much of Gaza's population [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=181.08s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people southwards towards relocation centers in the south [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=185.12s)]
*  But that military operation very much underway as we speak were Davis there on the border. Thanks very much indeed for the latest [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASGTtyzHLY&t=190.0s)]
