Video Description: Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected Poland's new president, the state electoral commission (PKW) said.
 
PKW said Nawrocki won 50.9% percent of the votes – ahead of Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski on 49.1% percent.
 
It's a sensational turnaround from the result of the first exit poll – published immediately after voting ended at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Sunday – that showed Trzaskowski winning on 50.3% to Nawrocki's 49.7%.
 
Trzaskowski had claimed victory after the first exit poll, while Nawrocki cautioned that the results were too close to call.

*  The war in Ukraine is being watched closely by neighbouring Poland, which has just held [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=0.0s)]
*  its pivotal presidential election. With all votes now counted, the right-wing historian [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=4.4s)]
*  Karol Nawrodzki is Poland's new president. The result is a major setback for the Prime [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=10.44s)]
*  Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU government. The state electoral commission said that Mr [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=16.56s)]
*  Nawrodzki won 50.89% ahead of Warsaw's Liberal Mayor Rafał Czarskowski on 49.11%. For more [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=22.48s)]
*  on this, let's speak to our correspondent who's in Warsaw for us, Adam Easton. Hello [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=33.28s)]
*  there to you, Adam. So this is a clear win then. There are no question marks about how [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=38.64s)]
*  tight it is or anything like that. It's an official result. The national electoral [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=43.92s)]
*  commission has just in the last few minutes confirmed that percentage, that lead by 1.7% [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=51.52s)]
*  victory, percentage points victory for Poland's right-wing historian Karol Nawrodzki. He will [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=59.6s)]
*  become Poland's new president. As you say, that's important because although the office is largely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=67.04s)]
*  ceremonial, he does have veto on legislation. And during the 18 months that the pro-EU Prime [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=72.56s)]
*  Minister Donald Tusk has been in power, he has been stymied by the current incumbent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=83.12s)]
*  Conservative president Andrzej Duda, who's blocked him in delivering many of his key campaign promises, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=89.12s)]
*  such as liberalizing the country's very strict abortion law, depoliticizing the judiciary. So [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=94.4s)]
*  Mr. Nawrodzki will continue to block Mr. Tusk's pro-EU program and his victory will also re-energize [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=100.08s)]
*  his supporters, Poland's main opposition, law and justice, Conservative opposition, who will now see [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=109.2s)]
*  that they are on their way to a return to power after 18 months when they were voted out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=115.28s)]
*  Parliamentary elections are not until 2027, but they will certainly see that they are now in the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=123.36s)]
*  ascendancy and Poland will be turning to a more conservative right-wing politics rather than [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=128.8s)]
*  cementing its place in the European mainstream with strong relations with Germany and France. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=136.24s)]
*  Who is, what more can you tell us about Mr. Nawrodzki? He's 42 years old, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  we've said he's an historian. What else can you add for us, Adam? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=148.0s)]
*  He's an historian because he's the head of the state national commission, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  remembrance commission, which investigates communist era and also World War II era crimes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=157.12s)]
*  He is a traditional conservative, Roman Catholic, he's got, he believes in strong, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=163.04s)]
*  sovereign Poland within the EU. He supports continued assistance to Ukraine, but unlike Mr. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=173.28s)]
*  Tsiolkovsky, he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO or the EU anytime soon because he thinks that's too [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  dangerous in the current climate of Russia's continued aggression. And he's also a big fan of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=185.28s)]
*  President Trump. He went, flew during the campaign for basically a thumbs up photograph in the Oval [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=192.48s)]
*  Office with Donald Trump, didn't do much more in terms of the meeting because he thought that would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  improve his chances. And so those sort of issues are anti-woke issues, freedom of speech issues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=204.96s)]
*  Adam? In fact, Donald Trump's... Adam, can I just jump in really quickly? He campaigned under the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=212.8s)]
*  slogan, Poland first, Poles first. How is that likely to be regarded with the EU? What sort of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  relationship could he have? He'll be much more pushy in terms of his relationship with Brussels, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  in terms of insisting on Poland, following it, what he believes it's in his national interests. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't want to cede any additional powers to Brussels. He'll be very tough on migration, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=240.72s)]
*  but there again, the Prime Minister Donald Trump is very much in favour of Poland. He's very [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=246.32s)]
*  tough on migration, but there again, the Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been very tough on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=252.72s)]
*  migration and that's becoming the European mainstream anyway. But certainly a more [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=256.4s)]
*  combative relationship with Brussels is to be expected under President Noworowski. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un9Fd8FNcRE&t=261.84s)]
