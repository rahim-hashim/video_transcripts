# Journalist accidentally added to US group chat on Yemen strike plans. #Yemen #US #GroupChat #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM)
*  It's stunning, isn't it, that a messaging app like Signal could be used to talk about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=0.0s)]
*  military plans and absolutely shocking that a journalist could accidentally be added to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=5.32s)]
*  this group of top national security officials. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=10.4s)]
*  It's obviously a pretty big security breach as well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=13.68s)]
*  President Trump was asked about it earlier and said he didn't actually know anything [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=16.46s)]
*  about this at all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  You're telling me about it for the first time. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=21.82s)]
*  These messages that he was able to read over several days in real time start off talking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  about possibly taking bombing action to protect shipping in the Suez Canal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=28.48s)]
*  And JD Vance, the vice president, is pretty skeptical because he says far fewer American [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=32.8s)]
*  ships use the canal than European ones. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=37.24s)]
*  So he writes in one message referencing Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=39.72s)]
*  He says, if you think we should do it, let's go. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=43.04s)]
*  I just hate bailing Europe out again. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=45.32s)]
*  And then the defence secretary responds saying, I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=48.56s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  Then the next day, the groups informed that the bombing raid has been a success and messages [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=57.36s)]
*  start flowing in from John Ratcliffe, the head of the CIA. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=61.42s)]
*  He said it was a good start. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=64.76s)]
*  Then you've got Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, just using some emojis. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  MAR, we assume, is Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=70.92s)]
*  He says, good job, Pete, and your team. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  Kudos to all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=76.92s)]
*  Chimes in Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and then the presidential envoy, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=77.92s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=82.68s)]
*  He's just got a few more emojis. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=83.68s)]
*  It's an astonishingly casual way of talking about a bombing raid which the Houthis say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=85.32s)]
*  killed 53 people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=90.24s)]
*  Now the White House has confirmed that the messages are authentic, so this journalist [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=93.16s)]
*  really was accidentally added to this group. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxGivtSajM&t=97.55999999999999s)]
