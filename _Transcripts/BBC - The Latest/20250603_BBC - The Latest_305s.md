Video Description: Portuguese and German authorities have started a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance.
 
Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in the Algarve during a family holiday on 3 May 2007.
 
The British toddler's disappearance sparked a Europe-wide police investigation, and is one of the world's highest-profile unsolved missing person cases.
 
On Monday, Portuguese police confirmed the search, carried out on warrants by German prosecutors, was across 21 different plots of land - between the resort Madeleine went missing from and where the prime suspect in her disappearance had been staying at the time.

# New searches in Madeleine McCann case by Portuguese and German authorities | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg)
*  Welcome back. German police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are carrying out new searches in Portugal this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=0.0s)]
*  The three-year-old went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=7.0s)]
*  The prime suspect in the investigation is Christian Bruckner, who is serving a prison sentence in Germany for the rape of an elderly woman in the same area of Portugal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=12.0s)]
*  Daniel Sanford is near the search site just to the east of Praia da Luz, and he has this update for us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=22.0s)]
*  Well, just to give you an idea of the geography, we're standing on a road that leads from Lagos in that direction to Praia da Luz in that direction. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=29.0s)]
*  And Praia da Luz was the resort where Madeleine McCann went missing 18 years ago when she was three years old. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=37.0s)]
*  She disappeared from a room in a holiday apartment where her family were staying. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=44.0s)]
*  And just behind me is a road leading down to the sea. And this is very much the focus of the search today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=49.0s)]
*  You can see there's Portuguese police blocking entrance to that road. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=57.0s)]
*  But what we've seen is four vehicles carrying German police heading down that road. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=61.0s)]
*  And they're the specialist search team that have come in from Germany. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=66.0s)]
*  We've also seen a Portuguese fire engine going down that road. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=69.0s)]
*  And that's in case the German police need to pump out any old wells as part of their search. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=73.0s)]
*  German police have got permission through the European search warrant system from the Portuguese prosecutor to go on to private land, to search on private land. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=79.0s)]
*  And there seems to be a focus around a disused farmhouse as part of the focus today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=90.0s)]
*  We've seen a large blue tent that German police have set up as their base for the search operation this week. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=95.0s)]
*  They've said that they'll be searching today through until Friday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=102.0s)]
*  So it's four days of searching. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=106.0s)]
*  We've not been told of any specific intelligence that the Germans are basing their search on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=109.0s)]
*  But we do know that Christiane Bruckner, the man that they say is their main suspect in what they call a murder investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=114.0s)]
*  is due for release from prison in September or possibly if he doesn't pay a fine until early 2026. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=123.0s)]
*  So less than a year for German police and prosecutors to get enough evidence to bring a charge against Christiane Bruckner and to put him on trial. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=133.0s)]
*  And I think that's probably the main reason for the searching this week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=143.0s)]
*  Not necessarily because they've got any very specific intelligence. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=148.0s)]
*  But they felt that they needed to come back and do another search through the disused buildings, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=151.0s)]
*  through the deep wells and water tanks and so on in this area. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=159.0s)]
*  The last time German police were in the Algarve they were very focused on a reservoir that's quite some distance from here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=163.0s)]
*  And that was because that was a place that Christiane Bruckner was known to go and camp. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=170.0s)]
*  And that was a very specific focus search. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=175.0s)]
*  This seems to be a much more generalised search this week. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=178.0s)]
*  And it'll go on until Friday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=181.0s)]
*  That's the latest from Prior Deluge with Daniel Sanford. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=184.0s)]
*  Let's bring you more on the investigation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=188.0s)]
*  We can take you live to Berlin and join our correspondent there, Jess Parker. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=190.0s)]
*  Jess, this is one of the world's highest profile unsolved missing person cases. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=194.0s)]
*  So much interest in this case again. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=199.0s)]
*  And a lot resting on the German police. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=202.0s)]
*  What is the latest that they're saying? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. A lot is resting on the German police. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=208.0s)]
*  It was five years ago that German authorities identified publicly Christian Bruckner, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=210.0s)]
*  or sometimes referred to as Christian B at the time, as a suspect in the case. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=218.0s)]
*  Daniel was just saying German investigators have classed this as a murder inquiry. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=224.0s)]
*  However, in the five years since Christian Bruckner emerged as a suspect, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=230.0s)]
*  he has never been charged and he, as we've been reflecting, denies involvement in the case. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=236.0s)]
*  Timing, I think, now is very important for the German authorities here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=242.0s)]
*  As we've been hearing, Christian Bruckner, he's in jail in Germany, in Lower Saxony, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=247.0s)]
*  for the rape of a pensioner in 2005 in Portugal's Algarve region. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=253.0s)]
*  That sentence is due to run out in September. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=258.0s)]
*  There are some question marks over an unpaid fine [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=261.0s)]
*  and whether that could keep him in jail a little bit longer, maybe until early next year. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=264.0s)]
*  But as a result, the German investigation has been characterized as something of a race against time [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=271.0s)]
*  as they look to potentially do one of two things. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=277.0s)]
*  Either keep building the case that they say they have, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=281.0s)]
*  although as I say they've never brought charges, against Christian Bruckner regarding Madeleine McCann, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=284.0s)]
*  or also to pursue an appeal on a separate case, which was heard last year at trial, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=288.0s)]
*  where Christian Bruckner was acquitted on five unrelated sex offence charges. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=294.0s)]
*  So those are some of the things that German prosecutors are dealing with right now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXre3VGD1Cg&t=300.0s)]
