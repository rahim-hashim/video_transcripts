# Could Trump actually reopen infamous Alcatraz prison? #Alcatraz #Trump #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY)
*  President Donald Trump says he wants to reopen Alcatraz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, that Alcatraz, the infamous prison on an island near San Francisco. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=3.64s)]
*  These ferries behind me transport one and a half million tourists there each year. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=8.68s)]
*  If President Trump has his way, the former federal prison turned National Park will once again house inmates. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=13.6s)]
*  He claims the U.S. is plagued by, quote, vicious, violent and repeat criminal offenders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=19.56s)]
*  and says he thinks that reopening a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz would serve as a symbol of law, order and justice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=25.12s)]
*  But here's the thing. Alcatraz was shut down as a prison back in 1963 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=33.56s)]
*  because it's so much more expensive to run than your average prison, as much as three times more by some estimates. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=38.64s)]
*  That's mostly because of its island location. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=45.64s)]
*  Alcatraz has been the subject of multiple Hollywood movies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=48.08s)]
*  Experts say the federal prison system actually has empty beds, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=51.68s)]
*  so there's no real need for a new facility, let alone a pricey one on an island. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=55.2s)]
*  Critics, including California Democrats, say this plan isn't serious. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=59.8s)]
*  They say it's more about political messaging than practical policy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y27opvr-3GY&t=64.16s)]
