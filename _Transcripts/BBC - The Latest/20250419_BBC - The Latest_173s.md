Video Description: Donald Trump has said the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv "make it very difficult" to reach a peace deal.
 
The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in "a specific number of days" but he wanted it done "quickly".
 
His comments came hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days.

*  He was echoing comments made earlier in the day by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=8.84s)]
*  who, on a trip to Paris, said the US would give up if there was no movement in a matter [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=13.0s)]
*  of days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=17.52s)]
*  From Washington, here's Jon Sudworth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=18.52s)]
*  Russian missiles continue to pound Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=22.72s)]
*  This attack left one person dead and injured more than 100. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=27.84s)]
*  But the man who once said he'd end the war on day one seems to be having second thoughts [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=33.2s)]
*  about ending it at all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=38.58s)]
*  If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=40.6s)]
*  to say you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, and we're going to just take [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=46.44s)]
*  a pass. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=51.0s)]
*  But hopefully we won't have to do that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=52.0s)]
*  The threat to walk away has come as a surprise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=55.12s)]
*  Talks between US, Ukrainian and European officials who met in Paris this week were said to be [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  going well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=63.94s)]
*  The first sign that something was wrong, though, came from one of those in attendance, America's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  top diplomat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=71.0s)]
*  But we're not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=72.0s)]
*  So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=75.92s)]
*  or not this is doable over the next few weeks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  If it is, we're in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=83.56s)]
*  If it's not, then we'll have to we have other priorities to focus on as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=84.84s)]

*  Progress on a minerals deal in which the US gets access to Ukrainian resources is still [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  being talked up by Washington as a demonstration of its long term commitment to the country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, Ukraine is increasingly troubled by the US president's outreach to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=104.56s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=109.48s)]
*  His envoy, Steve Witkoff, talks of a friendship with Vladimir Putin and of the compelling [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=110.48s)]
*  commercial opportunities with Moscow. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=115.58s)]
*  For now, Mr. Trump says he's still holding out hope of a peace deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=119.0s)]

*  us and I know when they're not. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=128.52s)]
*  And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=130.84s)]
*  And I think I see that enthusiasm. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  I think I see it from both sides. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OD4htggKpI&t=136.8s)]
