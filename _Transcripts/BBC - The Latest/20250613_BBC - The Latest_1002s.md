# Mid-East Crisis escalates - Iran rains missiles on Israel after attacks on nuclear sites | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU)
*  Iran has tonight launched retaliatory strikes on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's Revolutionary Guard says it attacked dozens of targets, including military centers and air bases. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv after an aerial attack on the Israeli city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=10.64s)]
*  Explosions have also been heard in Jerusalem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=17.2s)]
*  Tonight's bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran last night, which targeted military and nuclear sites. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=20.16s)]
*  Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=27.8s)]
*  The country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would inflict heavy blows in response. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=32.96s)]
*  Well, this was the scene in Tel Aviv in Israel just an hour or two ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=40.96s)]
*  There have been huge explosions in the sky over central Israel, although it is unclear what's from missile strikes and what is Israel intercepting them with its iron dome. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=46.28s)]
*  Tonight, Israel says it struck a nuclear facility in Isfahan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=57.48s)]
*  And that is in addition to last night's strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Netanz and also at Comanche. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=62.28s)]
*  Well, our first report tonight is from Lucy Williamson, who's in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=71.0s)]
*  In bunkers and stairwells, they listened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=78.36s)]
*  To Tel Aviv, under fire from Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=81.76s)]
*  Defenses scrambling above a city of civilians and military bases. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  From ballistic missiles arriving minutes after launch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=90.76s)]
*  Impacts felt inside shaking buildings. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=95.36s)]
*  For the third time tonight, missiles are being fired at Israel, fired at Tel Aviv. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  This is the response, Israel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  This is the response Israel was expecting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=109.76s)]
*  And all across the country, people are listening to the sound of Israel and Iran at war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=112.76s)]
*  Missile defense systems were also activated over Jerusalem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=119.76s)]
*  Israeli media reported several impacts across the country, including near military sites. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=123.76s)]
*  A direct hit to this building reportedly left people trapped inside. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=129.76s)]
*  Israel began striking Iran overnight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=134.76s)]
*  A nuclear enrichment site at Netanz, one of the first to be hit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=137.76s)]
*  A target for Israel's prime minister for decades. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=141.76s)]
*  Hit in what he said was a last chance to stop Iran making a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=144.76s)]
*  Air defenses, missile sites, nuclear scientists and military leaders, including the head of Iran's armed forces, wiped out in a series of nationwide strikes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=149.76s)]
*  An attack involving 200 fighter planes working with covert intelligence teams at a secret base inside Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=162.76s)]
*  These pictures from Israel's spy agency are said to show commandos firing at a missile launcher during this morning's attack. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=171.76s)]
*  Their prime minister said the clock on Iran's nuclear ambitions had run out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=179.76s)]
*  Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=184.76s)]
*  A targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=188.76s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=195.76s)]
*  For decades, the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=201.76s)]
*  In Iran, hundreds of protesters called for revenge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=210.76s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader said Israel had made an enormous miscalculation and that the consequences would bring it to ruin. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=213.76s)]
*  They should not imagine that they struck and it's over. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=225.76s)]
*  No, they started this. They launched a war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=228.76s)]
*  We will not allow them to escape unscathed from the major crime they have committed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=232.76s)]
*  Iran has also now reported unconfirmed signs of radiation at the Natanz nuclear site. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=243.76s)]
*  I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=249.76s)]
*  I reiterate that any military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region and beyond. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=255.76s)]
*  A former general in Israel's air force said there were limits to what military force could achieve. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=268.76s)]
*  I think we can say pretty much easily this was the most complicated and actually complicated, probably dangerous operation that Israel ever did in its history. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=274.76s)]
*  We have a huge military success, a huge one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=288.76s)]
*  Okay, what's the next step? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=292.76s)]
*  Are we going to transform it to something that will say, okay, the region is safe for the next 50 years, not having any nuclear threats from Iran? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=295.76s)]
*  Tonight, Israel was still striking across the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=306.76s)]
*  This explosion filmed in West Tehran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=310.76s)]
*  Others reported at nuclear facilities in Esfahan and Fordow. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=313.76s)]
*  Israel says Iran was secretly building a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=319.76s)]
*  Too big a risk, it said. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=323.76s)]
*  But Iran may now decide that negotiations won't protect it from attack and that a nuclear weapon will. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=325.76s)]
*  Well, the alerts have been lifted for now in Tel Aviv, but Israel's attack isn't over. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=336.76s)]
*  There's a drone just flying above us here and the threat, of course, hasn't gone as well. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=340.76s)]
*  Israel's prime minister tonight had a message directly for the Iranian people saying Israel's fight was not with them, it was with their government. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=346.76s)]
*  The time has come, he said, to stand up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=355.76s)]
*  And that strengthened the view that some people here have that Benjamin Netanyahu's goal is not just to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, but its regime as a whole. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=361.76s)]
*  Thanks so much, Lucy Williamson, there in Tel Aviv. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=373.76s)]
*  Let's assess the situation in Jerusalem as well. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=377.76s)]
*  Our correspondent, Ioni Wells, is there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=379.76s)]
*  What's the latest where you are, Ioni? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=381.76s)]
*  We saw a series of drones fly over Jerusalem, followed by some big explosions and bangs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=391.76s)]
*  Now, it's not clear if those were the sounds of strikes or interceptions by Israel's defense system. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=397.76s)]
*  Israel has said that the majority of drones and missiles that were fired by Iran were either intercepted or fell short. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=402.76s)]
*  Minutes before that, we had all received this emergency alert. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=410.76s)]
*  Sirens were going off here in the same way that they did at 3 a.m. this morning, urging people to go to shelter or remain very close to them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=414.76s)]
*  This was after Iran confirmed that it was launching retaliatory military strikes on central Israel after a series of Israeli strikes on Iran today. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=422.76s)]
*  Now, for now, that emergency alert has subsided. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=431.76s)]
*  People are being urged to remain cautious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=435.76s)]
*  But as the last 24 hours of evidence, that could change again very quickly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=437.76s)]
*  Ioni, thank you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=442.76s)]
*  Ioni Wells. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=443.76s)]
*  Well, this isn't the first conflict between Israel and Iran, but it is the most explosive. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=444.76s)]
*  The risks are huge. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=449.76s)]
*  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, is here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=451.76s)]
*  Frank. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=454.76s)]
*  Well, Jane, this conflict is bigger, more extensive and potentially more dangerous than anything that's gone before. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=455.76s)]
*  The targets hit range right across Iran. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=462.76s)]
*  It's the biggest assault on that country since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=466.76s)]
*  One of the principal targets was Natanz, around 200 miles south of Tehran. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=471.76s)]
*  Tonight, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says it's been destroyed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=476.76s)]
*  It was Iran's chief uranium enrichment facility. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=480.76s)]
*  That's a process that can have both peaceful and military purposes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=483.76s)]
*  Tonight, Israel said it also hit a nuclear site in Isfahan. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=487.76s)]
*  And in the western city of Kerman Shah, new footage of Israeli airstrikes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=495.76s)]
*  Missile bases have been struck across the country. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=499.76s)]
*  On top of this, key military figures have been assassinated. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=502.76s)]
*  Major General Hussein Salama, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=506.76s)]
*  Major General Mohammed Bagheri, head of Iran's armed forces, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=510.76s)]
*  and Brigadier General Amir Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=514.76s)]
*  Also targeted, at least six nuclear scientists. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=519.76s)]
*  So how is this being viewed by the Iranian public? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=522.76s)]
*  The mood in the country is really divided. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=526.76s)]
*  Some people, they're supporters of the Iranian establishment. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=528.76s)]
*  They are angry, they're furious, they want revenge. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=531.76s)]
*  However, there are some other Iranians, those who have been repressed [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=535.76s)]
*  in the past four decades by the Iranian regime, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=538.76s)]
*  they are quite happy that the top Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders are killed. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=542.76s)]
*  Now back in 2015, Iran was enriching uranium to just 3.6%, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=549.76s)]
*  enough for civil nuclear power. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=554.76s)]
*  Today, it's 60%, closer to what's needed for a bomb. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=556.76s)]
*  But it was Donald Trump, close ally of Israel, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=560.76s)]
*  who pulled the US out of a hard-won deal to curb Iran's enrichment. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=563.76s)]
*  Today, he's ordered more US naval forces to the Middle East, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=568.76s)]
*  amid fears that Iran could hit US bases. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=572.76s)]
*  And there's another risk, that Israel's operation could even backfire. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=575.76s)]
*  The military strikes from Israel are likely to expedite a thinking inside Iran [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=581.76s)]
*  about the fact that a nuclear bomb is the only real insurance [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=587.76s)]
*  that the Iranian leadership has against a major Israeli or US-led attack [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=591.76s)]
*  that targets the core of the leadership. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=598.76s)]
*  So look, in purely tactical terms, Israel, which don't forget is a nuclear power, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=601.76s)]
*  has achieved military success. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=606.76s)]
*  It struck deep into Iran and assassinated top commanders. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=608.76s)]
*  But this isn't the end. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=612.76s)]
*  If Iran's regime survives, it may well now race to build a bomb, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=614.76s)]
*  setting off a nuclear arms race across the Middle East. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=619.76s)]
*  Jane. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=623.76s)]
*  Frank, thank you, Frank Gardner. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=624.76s)]
*  Well, Israel's attacks come as the US and Iran are trying to reach a deal [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=626.76s)]
*  on Tehran's nuclear programme. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=631.76s)]
*  Talks are meant to resume this weekend. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=633.76s)]
*  President Trump has urged Iran to make a deal, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=635.76s)]
*  warning of even more brutal Israeli attacks if it doesn't. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=638.76s)]
*  Tonight, the Prime Minister, Sikir Starmer, spoke with President Trump. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=642.76s)]
*  The men say they agreed on the importance of diplomacy and dialogue [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=645.76s)]
*  to resolve this mounting conflict between Iran and Israel. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=649.76s)]
*  Tom Bateman reports. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=653.76s)]
*  A superpower at sea to defend its ally. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=657.76s)]
*  Tonight, the US confirmed it helped Israel shoot down Iranian missiles. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=660.76s)]
*  This sharp escalation after President Trump had been erring on the side of diplomacy. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=665.76s)]
*  As Israel attacked overnight, Washington warned Iran not to hit back [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=671.76s)]
*  at American bases, saying it wasn't involved. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=675.76s)]
*  But by this morning, Mr Trump was on the offensive, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=679.76s)]
*  saying Tehran's hardliners had lost the fight to get their terms on the nuclear deal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=682.76s)]
*  They're all dead now, he said, and it will only get worse. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=688.76s)]
*  There has already been great death and destruction, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=692.76s)]
*  but there is still time to make this slaughter [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=695.76s)]
*  with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal come to an end. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=697.76s)]
*  Tonight, the UN Security Council has been meeting in emergency session [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=702.76s)]
*  to discuss the crisis. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=708.76s)]
*  Amid the calls for de-escalation, the Americans warned about further consequences. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=710.76s)]
*  No government, proxy or independent actor should target American citizens, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=715.76s)]
*  American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=723.76s)]
*  The consequences for Iran would be dire. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=730.76s)]
*  We strongly and unequivocally condemn the barbaric and criminal attack. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=734.76s)]
*  A series of targeted assassinations were against senior military officials, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=740.76s)]
*  nuclear scientists and innocent civilians. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=746.76s)]
*  The Israeli leader has long pushed Mr Trump for a green light [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=751.76s)]
*  to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=755.76s)]
*  Timing was critical after Israel destroyed many Iranian air defences last year [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=758.76s)]
*  and wiped out much of the deterrent effect of Hezbollah on its own border. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=764.76s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu argued now was the time to strike. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=769.76s)]
*  But Mr Trump, via his envoy Steve Wyckoff, turned instead to rounds of talks with the Iranians. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=773.76s)]
*  Meaning this close but often fractious relationship was under even more strain. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=779.76s)]
*  Mr Trump told the Israelis publicly and privately he wanted more time for talks, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=784.76s)]
*  leading to a tense 40-minute phone call on Monday. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=790.76s)]
*  There's a chance of massive conflict. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=793.76s)]
*  We have a lot of American people in this area and I said, we've got to tell them to get out. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=795.76s)]
*  Mr Trump said he was losing confidence in the talks, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=800.76s)]
*  but as late as yesterday was still equivocating over an Israeli strike. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=803.76s)]
*  I'd much prefer an agreement. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=807.76s)]
*  As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=809.76s)]
*  because I think I would blow it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=813.76s)]
*  Might help it actually, but it also could blow it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=815.76s)]
*  It comes in a region on edge. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=818.76s)]
*  Some American embassies and bases are already partly evacuated. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=820.76s)]
*  At home, Mr Trump has been preparing for his big military parade. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=825.76s)]
*  His hope now is that his allies' deadly pressure pushes Iran towards a nuclear deal on his terms. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=829.76s)]
*  His opponents are already accusing him of enabling a reckless gamble, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=836.76s)]
*  risking America getting dragged into a war with Iran. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=841.76s)]
*  Tom Bateman, BBC News, Washington. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=845.76s)]
*  Well, in a moment we'll get the thoughts of Lis de Set, who is here with me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=848.76s)]
*  First, though, let's head to Washington and join Gary O'Donoghue, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=852.76s)]
*  and that's one of the key questions where you are, Gary. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=856.76s)]
*  Can the US avoid being dragged into this? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=859.76s)]
*  The administration's position has clearly evolved over the last 20 hours. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=862.76s)]
*  We started with the Secretary of State describing it as a unilateral action. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=866.76s)]
*  Now today Donald Trump talking about it being an excellent piece of action [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=871.76s)]
*  involving great American hardware, and indeed we're now learning that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=875.76s)]
*  Americans are involved in helping intercept these missiles coming in. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=879.76s)]
*  It comes with domestic risks for the president. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=883.76s)]
*  Yes, there's strong support for Israel, but there also is some kind of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=886.76s)]
*  strong animosity to any further involvement in Middle East wars [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=890.76s)]
*  and the 40,000 US troops that are in the region. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=894.76s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump, you know, he's always talked about promises made, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=898.76s)]
*  promises kept, and politics is about the deliverables. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=902.76s)]
*  If you look at Ukraine, if you look at the hostages in Gaza, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=906.76s)]
*  if you look at getting Iran to do a deal, I think this president is [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=910.76s)]
*  finding the process of delivering harder than he thought it would be. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=914.76s)]
*  Thanks, Gary, Gary O'Donoghue, and Lisa Set as our chief international [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=918.76s)]
*  correspondent, of course, and people watching, Lisa, will want to know [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=922.76s)]
*  what will happen, where will this go now? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=926.76s)]
*  But it is so unpredictable. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=929.76s)]
*  So unpredictable and so perilous. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=931.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel is making it clear he's waited a long [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=933.76s)]
*  time for this moment and he's not going to waste it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=937.76s)]
*  We have seen in the war across the region over nearly two years now [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=940.76s)]
*  that the guardrails are off. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=944.76s)]
*  So now, Mr. Netanyahu is saying he wants to destroy Iran's weapons-making [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=946.76s)]
*  capability. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=950.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=951.76s)]
*  How far will it go? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=953.76s)]
*  All we know on day one is that it's going to take days with all of the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=955.76s)]
*  dangers of escalation, both deliberate and accidental. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=959.76s)]
*  But there are Iranian hardliners who also have been waiting to have a go [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=963.76s)]
*  at Israel. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=967.76s)]
*  They believe they were held back last year, told to exercise restraint, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=968.76s)]
*  and now they literally are calling the shots. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=972.76s)]
*  So, day one, Israeli and Iranian civilians are being hurt and killed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=975.76s)]
*  There's growing fears about the danger of contamination and leakage. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=979.76s)]
*  And finally, Prime Minister Netanyahu has also been making clear, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=984.76s)]
*  as we heard in this programme, he wants Iranians to use this moment to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=987.76s)]
*  rise up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=991.76s)]
*  Many do want to see the back of the regime, but many don't. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=992.76s)]
*  And that, too, could be explosive. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=995.76s)]
*  Lisa, as ever, thank you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=998.76s)]
