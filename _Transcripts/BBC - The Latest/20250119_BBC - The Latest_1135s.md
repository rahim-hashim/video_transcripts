Video Description: Three hostages - who had been held by Hamas in Gaza for 15 months - are back in Israeli territory.

The released women - Doron Steinbrecher, Emily Damari, and Romi Gonen - are being treated in a Tel Aviv hospital, and are in a stable condition.

Hamas has said for every hostage released, 30 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails - it means 90 Palestinians are expected to be released soon.

The long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into force after a last-minute delay, but joy faded as Palestinians returned to their destroyed homes.

# Three Israeli hostages 'stable' after being freed, as Palestinian prisoners await release | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk)
*  Well, the pictures we saw earlier of the released hostages came at the end of a day full of striking developments. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=0.0s)]
*  Here are just a few of them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=5.44s)]
*  This is the moment the first hostages to be released by Hamas under the deal were transferred from captivity to the Red Cross. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=7.2s)]
*  What happened in Gaza City, at this point we can only catch a fleeting glimpse of them, but they appear to be able to walk [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=19.52s)]
*  unaided as they get into the Red Cross vehicle. We can see a number of what appear to be armed Hamas fighters surrounding them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=25.12s)]
*  Well, those pictures emerged some time after the exchange had taken place, but details were made public. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=33.6s)]
*  This is how Israelis who'd gathered in Tel Aviv reacted when they heard the news. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=38.32s)]
*  And this is the moment the mothers of the three hostages learnt they'd been handed over to the Red Cross. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, meanwhile, across Gaza, many of the hundreds of thousands of people who were displaced by the fighting have begun returning to their homes, many of which have been destroyed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=50.8s)]
*  These pictures show people walking back into the Jabalia area, which was targeted many times in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=57.8s)]
*  Israel says it was targeting militants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=64.8s)]
*  Well, our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, takes us through all today's developments as after 15 months of war, the ceasefire in Gaza began. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=67.8s)]
*  In the centre of Gaza City, a show of force by Hamas as they handed the hostages over to the International Red Cross. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=81.8s)]
*  In the white vehicles, Romy Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Demary, a British-Israeli dual citizen, were starting their journey back to freedom. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=88.8s)]
*  The men and guns were there to send a signal that whatever Israel says or wants, Hamas is still in charge in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=99.8s)]
*  That sight will infuriate Israelis. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=106.8s)]
*  Israeli TV showed a glimpse of one of the hostages in a pink top while the whole country was watching and waiting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=111.8s)]
*  This is the family of Romy Gonen. This day has been a long time coming. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=121.8s)]
*  The families and their supporters have campaigned constantly for a deal to get the hostages back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=126.8s)]
*  At first light, thousands of Palestinians in Gaza began trying to walk home. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=134.8s)]
*  This fragile ceasefire started almost three hours late. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=140.8s)]
*  With zero trust on either side, Israel continued its attacks here in Khan Yunis as it waited for the names of the women being released. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=144.8s)]
*  Gaza civil defence run by Hamas said 19 more Palestinians were killed by Israel during the delay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=155.8s)]
*  Hamas joined the celebrations trying to claim some kind of victory. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=163.8s)]
*  The Israelis have destroyed the offensive power Hamas used to attack them 15 months ago. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=168.8s)]
*  But the Americans say Hamas has nearly as many new recruits as Israel has killed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=174.8s)]
*  After so much bloodshed, celebratory gunfire did not make Jana flinch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=181.8s)]
*  May God have mercy on the oppressed and those who have passed and pity on us who survived. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=188.8s)]
*  And God willing, everyone will return home. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=194.8s)]
*  This celebration in Khan Yunis was filmed by a trusted Palestinian cameraman working for the BBC. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=198.8s)]
*  Israel does not let international journalists enter Gaza to report freely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=205.8s)]
*  Just over the border in Israel is the site of the Nova Music Festival, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=213.8s)]
*  where Hamas killed more than 380 people on the 7th of October and took 40 hostage. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=217.8s)]
*  This weekend, with the ceasefire coming, many Israelis made their own pilgrimages, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=223.8s)]
*  moving quietly around the photos and memorials to those who were killed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=228.8s)]
*  A short distance away is another memorial, the festival-goers' cars, hundreds of them destroyed in the attack. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=237.8s)]
*  Israelis here said they'd wanted a deal in which all the hostages were swapped for Palestinian prisoners at the same time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=245.8s)]
*  That's because they believed the war is going to resume. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=253.8s)]
*  They said it was unavoidable while Hamas still has armed men in Gaza. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=256.8s)]
*  They want to kill us. They want to finish us. So what is the good questions? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=261.8s)]
*  Look, look, this is the answer. This is what they want. Can we live like this? No. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=266.8s)]
*  A ceasefire by definition is a compromise between enemies, but since the October attacks, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=276.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has talked repeatedly about getting all the hostages back through total victory. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=282.8s)]
*  The complete annihilation of Hamas as a political and military force. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=290.8s)]
*  But right now, that is not what the Israeli people are being offered. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=295.8s)]
*  Tonight, thousands gathered in the square in Tel Aviv where the hostage campaign has based itself since the first weeks of the war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=300.8s)]
*  It's a night for hope and relief in Israel and Gaza and some trepidation about the future. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=310.8s)]
*  I spoke to our correspondent, Jonah Fisher, who is at Sheba Hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=317.8s)]
*  where the released hostages are now, and he told us more about the atmosphere there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=322.8s)]
*  It was quite a moment when the helicopter arrived here and then vehicles drove them into the building behind me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=326.8s)]
*  Obviously, the media is being kept at arm's length, but we have had footage released by the Israeli authorities [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=334.8s)]
*  of what has been going on inside the hospital behind me, really, really emotional scenes of Romy, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=342.8s)]
*  Doran and of Emily being reunited, not just with their families, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=350.8s)]
*  because of course their mothers went to meet them as they emerged out of Gaza, but from their friends as well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=355.8s)]
*  Hugging, lots of singing, crying, and of course, the whole family was there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=362.8s)]
*  This has been a very emotional day here at the hospital. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=369.8s)]
*  And there will have been preparations for what they go through next to try and recover from the emotional [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=374.8s)]
*  and the physical burden that they've had in the last 15 months or so? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=380.8s)]
*  Yes, there are clearly physical injuries which are already being addressed. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=385.8s)]
*  We saw Emily Demary, the British Israeli national, with bandages on one hand. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=391.8s)]
*  We know that she was shot as she was taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=397.8s)]
*  and it appears almost immediately that she came out of Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=403.8s)]
*  That was addressed by medics down there and no doubt will be looked at again here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=408.8s)]
*  We also know that Romy has most likely got injuries which need to be addressed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=415.8s)]
*  But in terms of their general health, all three of them were walking and they seemed clearly in buoyant moods. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=420.8s)]
*  In terms of what this means for them psychologically, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=427.8s)]
*  and there will be psychologists here available to work with them, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=431.8s)]
*  they will have to begin to try and address and to work through the situation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=436.8s)]
*  They will have no doubt experienced over the last 15 months being held captive in Gaza, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=442.8s)]
*  possibly in tunnels, being hidden away. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=448.8s)]
*  We don't know yet how they've been treated by their Hamas captors, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=452.8s)]
*  but from the accounts of other hostages, perhaps not very well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=456.8s)]
*  They may have and almost certainly have had a miserable time for that period in captivity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=460.8s)]
*  There will be physical and psychological things that will be being addressed by the team here at the Sheba Medical Centre. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=467.8s)]
*  This is a huge hospital, one of the biggest in the Middle East. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=474.8s)]
*  They will have all the specialists that they need on hand to start the process of coming to terms with what's happened to them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=478.8s)]
*  These clearly are the first three hostages to be released. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=485.8s)]
*  Tell us about the process now and how long this is going to take. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=489.8s)]
*  It's a complicated process and it's in many phases. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=494.8s)]
*  Effectively, the way it works is that a group of Israeli hostages are released [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=498.8s)]
*  and in return Palestinian prisoners and detainees are released as well. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=503.8s)]
*  Today we have 90 Palestinian prisoners being released, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=508.8s)]
*  30 for each of the Israeli hostages that were released. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=511.8s)]
*  There will be a series of releases over the following weeks. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=515.8s)]
*  This is a six-week temporary ceasefire. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=520.8s)]
*  During that period, there will be 33 hostages released by Hamas, if everything goes according to plan. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=523.8s)]
*  They are children, women, the elderly, the sick and the injured. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=531.8s)]
*  We're not expecting all of the 33 to have survived this and to still be alive. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=536.8s)]
*  Israel is being prepared for the fact that as well as live hostages being released, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=542.8s)]
*  it's likely that in some of the releases that followed, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=547.8s)]
*  it's going to be the bodies of Israeli hostages being returned as well as hostages who have survived. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=551.8s)]
*  Some of this is clearly difficult for the Israelis because these are some of the Palestinian prisoners [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=558.8s)]
*  who are being released are people that they would view as a serious potential risk to Israel. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=564.8s)]
*  Talk us through how people are receiving that side of things, the concept of the prisoner exchange. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=570.8s)]
*  This is something which Israel has gone through in the past. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=576.8s)]
*  The negotiations and the release of Gilad Shalita, a soldier who was captured and held in Gaza, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=581.8s)]
*  and then led to the release of more than 1,000 prisoners, many of whom went on to commit crimes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=588.8s)]
*  Indeed, one of them, Yahya Sinwa, became the leader of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=595.8s)]
*  People here are acutely aware that in return for getting these hostages back, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=602.8s)]
*  they are releasing people who have done bad things to Israelis. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=609.8s)]
*  On the long list, not people who are released today but set to be released, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=614.8s)]
*  there are people who have murdered Israelis, who have planted bombs, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=618.8s)]
*  that have blown up multiple Israelis at the same time. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=621.8s)]
*  Yes, that is the other side of this, the price which is being paid for each one of these hostages. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=624.8s)]
*  The potential risk for the future, if you like, that Israel is creating [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=630.8s)]
*  by letting these people with a record of violence free. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=636.8s)]
*  Jonah Fisher there. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=641.8s)]
*  As we've heard, among those released is British-Israeli dual national, Emily Demary. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=642.8s)]
*  The 28-year-old's family have roots in Beckham in South East London. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=647.8s)]
*  Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, has been speaking to some of her family. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=650.8s)]
*  Well, here in North London, there has been some joy amongst the family [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=655.8s)]
*  and supporters of Emily Demary that she has been released, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=659.8s)]
*  tempered by the fact that there are still hostages being held. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=663.8s)]
*  There's been a gathering to celebrate her release [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=667.8s)]
*  and also to call for the release of other hostages. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=670.8s)]
*  And I'm joined by a cousin of Emily Demary, Tony Moss. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=673.8s)]
*  Tony, just give me your reaction to the release of Emily this afternoon, this evening. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=678.8s)]
*  We're just overjoyed, lost for words. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=685.8s)]
*  Can't quite believe it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=687.8s)]
*  Didn't think it was going to happen and that it should be first out. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=689.8s)]
*  We just can't quite believe it. We're all so sad. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=692.8s)]
*  This is just the beginning. We need to get the other hostages out. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=695.8s)]
*  We could be happy today for Emily, Mandy and the family [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=698.8s)]
*  and the other hostages that have been released, but this is just the beginning. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=702.8s)]
*  We've got to get all the hostages out. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=706.8s)]
*  What does it mean to you after this long ordeal that Emily is now home? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=708.8s)]
*  Just huge relief, huge relief. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=713.8s)]
*  Just there's been an anxiety for 471 days, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=718.8s)]
*  a huge anxiety that we're all carrying around with us. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=721.8s)]
*  And we can let that go now, but only in respect of Emily. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=724.8s)]
*  But we've got to get the other hostages out. I know I keep saying that, but we do. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=728.8s)]
*  And what were your emotions when you heard the news and when you saw the pictures? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=733.8s)]
*  I broke down when I saw the pictures, when I saw the pictures [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=738.8s)]
*  only once Emily was in the hands of her mother Mandy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=741.8s)]
*  Because you saw how fragile it was when they were in Gaza, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=745.8s)]
*  surrounded by Hamas terrorists and mobs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=748.8s)]
*  That was still extremely fragile. Anything could have happened. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=751.8s)]
*  But once she was in the hands, back over the border [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=754.8s)]
*  and in the hands of her mother where she should have been, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=756.8s)]
*  then just huge relief. Then I broke down in tears. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=759.8s)]
*  And that photo of Emily smiling with her mum Mandy? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=763.8s)]
*  Amazing, absolutely amazing. Even though you saw she's got some fingers missing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=767.8s)]
*  She was shot on the day she was taken. They shot her dog dead and shot her fingers. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=770.8s)]
*  But she's still smiling, she's smiling. She's an amazing spirit, Emily. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=777.8s)]
*  And may that be hope for the other hostages and their families. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=781.8s)]
*  And what has been the discussion in the family chat group with Mandy? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=785.8s)]
*  There's only one thing under discussion. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=790.8s)]
*  This morning, first thing when we heard the news, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=792.8s)]
*  Mandy sent a message to the family WhatsApp group that she's packed a bag [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=794.8s)]
*  and she's waiting to hear where and when. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=797.8s)]
*  But she won't believe it until she's got her in her arms. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=801.8s)]
*  She refused to believe until it happened. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=804.8s)]
*  And what was the message when Emily was released? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=807.8s)]
*  Just, she's here, she's here. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=811.8s)]
*  You know Mandy's got this special thing with her daughter Emily [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=813.8s)]
*  about a hug for 40 seconds, because it takes 40 seconds [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=815.8s)]
*  for the dopamine to be released. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=818.8s)]
*  So she just was waiting for that hug for 471 days. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=820.8s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=824.8s)]
*  But now we need to hug the other hostages. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=826.8s)]
*  We need to get them out. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=829.8s)]
*  And for you and your family tonight, a bit of relief, a lot of relief really? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=832.8s)]
*  Huge, just huge relief. Huge relief for us. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=838.8s)]
*  What have the last months, more than a year, felt like? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=842.8s)]
*  Just hugely stressful. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=845.8s)]
*  Just anxiety, stress, turmoil. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=847.8s)]
*  Ended for us now, in respect to Emily. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=852.8s)]
*  But not for those other families. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=856.8s)]
*  So bring them home. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=858.8s)]
*  And what will your message be to Mandy, to Emily, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=860.8s)]
*  in that family WhatsApp group this evening? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=863.8s)]
*  We're going to carry on fighting and all the people you see around you, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=866.8s)]
*  there are so many people to thank, the tireless work that they do, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=868.8s)]
*  putting ribbons up, balloons, singing at spurs, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=873.8s)]
*  talking to politicians, writing to politicians. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=877.8s)]
*  There is so much more work to be done, and we will be continuing to do that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=880.8s)]
*  until all those hostages are delivered back home. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=884.8s)]
*  And those pictures, it seemed that Emily was in, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=887.8s)]
*  it seemed on the surface pretty good spirits. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=890.8s)]
*  It's just the start. Who knows what mental conditions she's in. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=892.8s)]
*  But she's alive, she was smiling. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=895.8s)]
*  This is the beginning, and thank God she's home to her mum and her brothers. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=897.8s)]
*  But I have no idea what condition she's really in, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=902.8s)]
*  and that's why she's gone to hospital, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=905.8s)]
*  and I'm sure they'll take amazing care of her. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=907.8s)]
*  And it will give hope to all those other families. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=909.8s)]
*  Well, some really positive emotions there felt by Emily DiMari's relations [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=912.8s)]
*  and supporters here who have been out with yellow balloons, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=918.8s)]
*  yellow ribbons, been at spurs matches. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=921.8s)]
*  These are the first three hostages to be released, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=924.8s)]
*  and the hope here from all the supporters is that there will be more. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=926.8s)]
*  Lucy Manning reporting. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=930.8s)]
*  Well, Palestinians have begun to return to Ra'far in Gaza, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=931.8s)]
*  where they've been making their way through the rubble. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=934.8s)]
*  Here's what some of them had to say about the ceasefire. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=937.8s)]
*  It is an indescribable feeling for Ra'far and the entire nation. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=940.8s)]
*  At first in Ra'far, we see the destruction, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=945.8s)]
*  destruction we have not seen before. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=948.8s)]
*  We were talking about a genocide, but it is more than genocide. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=951.8s)]
*  May God be with our people and grant them patience [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=955.8s)]
*  and have mercy on our martyrs and heal our wounded. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=959.8s)]
*  We hope that this truce continues, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=963.8s)]
*  and this is the end of the bloodshed, the torrent of blood, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=965.8s)]
*  which our people paid a heavy price for. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=969.8s)]
*  Our people gave a lot. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=972.8s)]
*  I entered this area nearly 20 to 25 days before the Jewish forces came here. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=975.8s)]
*  The houses were there where the people are standing. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=980.8s)]
*  Our hearts were just aching once we saw the scenes today. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=983.8s)]
*  Someone like my father, who is 75 years old, he'll get a stroke, he'll fall, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=986.8s)]
*  and who will compensate him? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=990.8s)]
*  My cousin who was martyred, my brother who died, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=992.8s)]
*  my cousin, my brother's house, my sister's house, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=994.8s)]
*  my cousin's house, the neighbour's house, who will compensate us? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=996.8s)]
*  Well, ceasefire means that aid deliveries are increasing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1000.8s)]
*  The World Food Programme sent this video of trucks moving across into Gaza from Ra'far. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1003.8s)]
*  BBC Arabic's Abdelbasser Hassan is on the Egyptian side of the Ra'far crossing. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1009.8s)]
*  This is Ra'far crossing from the Egyptian side, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1015.8s)]
*  and it is the first day of the implementation of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1018.8s)]
*  The first aid trucks have been seen entering Gaza this morning since the ceasefire came into effect. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1024.8s)]
*  The United Nations Food Agency says its aid trucks have entered into Gaza, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1031.8s)]
*  via two crossings, Zakeem in the north and Kerm Shalom in the south. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1037.8s)]
*  Other aid trucks have been seen entering the trip via the Ra'far crossing. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1042.8s)]
*  The first aid trucks carried life-saving wheat flour and ready-to-eat food parcels for people in the desperate need. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1048.8s)]
*  The World Food Programme says an X. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1058.8s)]
*  Gaza relies heavily on aid for food, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1061.8s)]
*  and in recent weeks just 40 trucks of aid were getting on average, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1065.8s)]
*  while pre-conflict around 500 trucks entered Gaza daily. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1072.8s)]
*  The ceasefire deal required 608 trucks to enter each day. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1078.8s)]
*  Let's bring you live pictures now from Ofar Prison, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1085.8s)]
*  where we're expecting the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of this exchange. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1088.8s)]
*  We're expecting around 90 Palestinian prisoners to be released, and that hasn't yet happened. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1092.8s)]
*  What we understand is happening is that the Red Cross is still examining those Palestinian prisoners inside Ofar Prison. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1097.8s)]
*  Israel is due to release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners over the course of the 42-day, or six-week, initial ceasefire, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1104.8s)]
*  according to the terms of the agreement. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1112.8s)]
*  Starting with those 90 on Sunday in exchange for the three Israeli hostages that we've been talking about [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1115.8s)]
*  who have now been released by Hamas and who are back inside Israel in the hospital, as you saw earlier. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1121.8s)]
*  But it seems that the initial exchange of the Palestinian prisoners has not yet happened. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_jjyt5mPjk&t=1127.8s)]
