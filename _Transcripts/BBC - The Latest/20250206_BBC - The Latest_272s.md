# Sweden mourns after deadliest shooting as gunman details emerge | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU)
*  Now, reports in Sweden say that several weapons believed to be rifles have been found at an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=0.0s)]
*  adult education centre in the country where a gunman killed 10 people. Swedish police [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  say they have still not established a motive for the attack, which took place on Tuesday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=11.48s)]
*  Will I speak to my colleague Kasha Madera, who's in Oroboros for us. Kasha, bring us [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=17.2s)]
*  up to date. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=21.8s)]
*  So Catherine, Swedish police have just been giving a press briefing in the building behind [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=25.28s)]
*  me and we're getting more details about that horrific attack on Tuesday at an adult education [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  campus just a few minutes away from here. And we're hearing about the level of violence [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=36.28s)]
*  that took place there. And I'm just going to go through some of the details and apologies [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=42.36s)]
*  to our audience because some of this is pretty grim. We know that of course 10 people were [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  shot dead in what is described as the worst mass shooting in Sweden's history. So according [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=51.68s)]
*  to the police briefing that has just taken place, the alarm of the mass shooting was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=58.2s)]
*  raised at 12.33 local time, so at lunchtime. Now, thankfully, there weren't as many students [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=64.2s)]
*  in this education campus. There were a number of schools within this facility because on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=70.6s)]
*  that day there was a national exam in the morning. So thankfully, there weren't as many [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=75.76s)]
*  people there. But those who were there were caught up in what was horrific, described [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=79.76s)]
*  as absolutely horrific and brutal. We know that police were, the alarm was raised at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=85.64s)]
*  12.30. Police were on the scene just over five minutes later and they went straight [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=92.64s)]
*  into the building. They describe what was an inferno with dead people, with screaming [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=97.84s)]
*  and with smoke. Of course, we've heard from some of the witnesses and the survivors, the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=105.48s)]
*  scenes of blood, the huge amounts of blood witnessed by them on that day. Many people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=110.48s)]
*  still traumatized as indeed this whole country is. Now, shortly after the police entered, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=116.12s)]
*  they noticed some kind of smoke rising. They perceived that someone is approaching and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=121.34s)]
*  they were being shot at. They describe how they see a perpetrator armed with a rifle-like [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=127.04s)]
*  weapon just over 10 minutes after the first response team is on site. So the shooting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=133.24s)]
*  was ongoing. And we just get a few more updates when the police are talking about being caught [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=139.88s)]
*  in what they describe as crossfire. But it's still details that they're just bringing to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  us. Now, just one thing that they say, which I'm going to bring you is that apologies because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=153.56s)]
*  this is lines just coming into us as this press conference is taking place. An extensive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=159.72s)]
*  shooting with rifle-like weapons against police patrols. And at the scene, police are saying [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  that they found around 10 empty magazines and a large amount of unused ammunition was [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=170.72s)]
*  found next to and at this point, the deceased perpetrator. And we're just saying that police [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  did not respond to the gunfire. They believe that the shooting began to be directed at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  police officers instead of at students and staff when they then entered into this educational [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=188.36s)]
*  facility. So a lot of detail coming through. But of course, Catherine, what we don't know [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  yet is of the motive and just apologies. We're just getting a few more lines because the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=200.4s)]
*  Syrian embassy here in Sweden have said that Syrians were amongst the victims. This is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=206.22000000000003s)]
*  stuff that is details that are just coming through. And we need to, of course, digest [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=212.36s)]
*  this information that is coming through and of course, verify it as well. But the Syrian [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=217.48s)]
*  embassy here in Sweden is saying that Syrians were amongst the victims. Now, important just [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=221.4s)]
*  to stress that this educational facility, it's an adult educational facility. It's a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=226.52s)]
*  place where people go to who haven't perhaps finished primary school or secondary school. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=231.8s)]
*  They go in and top up their educational qualifications and also where people go to learn [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=237.2s)]
*  Swedish as a foreign language for those people coming into this country. So, of course, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=243.52s)]
*  there is no motive yet and police are yet to identify and confirm the name of the perpetrator. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=248.72s)]
*  But the national broadcaster here in Sweden are describing him as 35 year old Ricard Anderson, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=255.72s)]
*  who had been unemployed for 10 years. But that is yet to be officially confirmed. Catherine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  Kasha, thank you. That's Kasha Madera live in Arabera for us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRE2c77xAU&t=267.96000000000004s)]
