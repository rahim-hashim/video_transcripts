Video Description: The Spanish government is calling for an international arms embargo on the Israeli government to end the war and the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.

"We must all agree on a joint arms embargo," Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares told journalists at the start of an international meeting on the crisis in the Spanish capital. "The last thing the Middle East needs right now is weapons."

Israeli airstrikes killed 30 Palestinians in the last 24 hours according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled health ministry. 

Small quantities of aid have entered Gaza but only a small fraction of what is required to prevent mass starvation.  There   is desperate need for food, water and medicine, with Gaza’s youngest children the most vulnerable.

# Call for arms embargo on Israel as Gaza’s children face starvation | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk)
*  Israel should face an arms embargo if it doesn't stop its attacks on Gaza, says the Spanish [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=0.0s)]
*  government, which is hosting a meeting in Madrid of Arab and European countries, including [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=5.72s)]
*  the UK, on how to end the war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=10.3s)]
*  Today Israeli airstrikes killed 30 Palestinians, while yesterday two members of the International [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Red Cross were killed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=18.52s)]
*  Some limited aid of 107 trucks did enter Gaza, but humanitarian organizations say that much [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=20.54s)]
*  more, up to 600 trucks a day, is what is desperately needed following 11 weeks of a blockade on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=26.880000000000003s)]
*  aid by Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  Fergal Kean reports now on the situation facing the youngest members of Gaza's population, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=35.08s)]
*  and there are distressing images. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=40.52s)]
*  We see it and we hear it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=46.64s)]
*  From far away, but in sound and color, an agony that cannot be denied. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=53.64s)]
*  Today a British doctor captured these images in the pediatric ward of Nasser Hospital. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=64.48s)]
*  The young and vulnerable. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=70.76s)]
*  There was abundant aid that could have helped them, but nearly three months of Israeli blockade [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=75.36s)]
*  kept it out of Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  How they were once and how they are now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=83.96s)]
*  These children are so malnourished that they're actually wasting away. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=87.44s)]
*  It's shocking to see this degree of malnutrition and it's because of the blockade. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  The hunger ward, where a colleague first met five-month-old Siobhán Assur. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=104.32s)]
*  Allergic to regular milk formula, the special variety she needed was running out under the blockade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=112.32s)]
*  When I change her, her body is very bad and dehydrated. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=122.0s)]
*  She's like a skeleton. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=126.88s)]
*  Whenever I look at her, I cry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=128.84s)]
*  I cannot bear how thin she is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=131.64s)]
*  Her condition stabilized. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  And a week ago, Siobhán was sent home from the busy hospital with a can of baby formula. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=143.4s)]
*  The situation is very dire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  We're staying in a tent and there are many insects. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  The insects come at her. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=158.28s)]
*  I have to cover her with a scarf so nothing touches her. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Even though Israel is now allowing some aid into Gaza, there's nothing like enough nutrition [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  for Siobhán. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=171.72s)]
*  Her mum says her weight has dropped again in recent days. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Currently, there is no food or nutrients. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=176.88s)]
*  The water is polluted and we force ourselves to drink it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=180.96s)]
*  We don't have food or bread. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  The shelter was hit by gunfire when people attempted to loot food nearby. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  When Siobhán hears the sounds of the rockets, she gets startled and she cries. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=196.1s)]
*  She understands these things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=204.38s)]
*  The sound of the tanks, warplanes and rockets are so loud and they are close to us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=206.54s)]
*  And if she was sleeping, she would wake up startled and crying. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=212.66s)]
*  The Israeli government said three days ago there was no food crisis in Gaza. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=220.14s)]
*  But that it was now allowing aid to prevent one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=225.14s)]
*  Life is hunger, fear and trauma. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=233.54s)]
*  Dr. Wasim Said is a British plastic surgeon who has just returned from Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=240.54s)]
*  He's treated many children, like six-year-old Noor, who suffered severe blast and burn injuries [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=257.98s)]
*  Lack of nutrition is making it much harder for wounds to heal, he says. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=262.26s)]
*  You could see people losing hope, you could see how depressed they were, the nutritional [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=266.98s)]
*  status of everybody was appalling. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  So grafts were not taking, wounds were not healing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=276.5s)]
*  Yet for all that he's seen, this British doctor wants to go back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  It's his human duty, he told us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=288.1s)]
*  None of this needed to happen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=289.98s)]
*  Every time you see a child you think of your own children and how, well, you try not to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=292.9s)]
*  at the time because it would be untrue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=301.38s)]
*  You couldn't work if you thought, what if this was happened to my daughter or heaven [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=304.26s)]
*  forbid or something like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=309.58s)]
*  Set against the raging war, a child's life is a fragile thing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=314.38s)]
*  But loved, dearly, from one heartbeat to the next. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=319.3s)]
*  Ferdal Keene, BBC News. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=326.3s)]
*  Well Israel does not allow international media organisations including the BBC into Gaza [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=331.74s)]
*  and we use trusted freelance teams on the ground. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's turn now to our correspondent Barbara Pletasha who's in Jerusalem for us and Barbara [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  some terrible scenes of suffering there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=345.06s)]
*  We know that some aid has got in, are we likely to see any improvement soon? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=347.9s)]
*  Well Israel says it has allowed around 500 lorries carrying food supplies into Gaza over [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=355.58s)]
*  the past week and some of that has been distributed but there's been a lot of chaos and insecurity. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=360.7s)]
*  Desperate people overwhelming bread bakeries for example and armed men looting some of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  the aid. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=371.14s)]
*  UN officials say that that's because so little has been let in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  They say this wasn't a problem during the ceasefire when Gaza was flooded with aid and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=375.54s)]
*  that needs to happen again. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=380.1s)]
*  But Israel is saying no, it's going to try something new, it's going to use a private [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=381.66s)]
*  company backed by the US to distribute food and arguing that this is going to prevent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=385.42s)]
*  Hamas from stealing aid and so reduce its influence. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=390.5s)]
*  But there's a lot of criticism about this plan, not least because this company doesn't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=393.54s)]
*  have the supplies and the structures that the UN has and so at best at the moment it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=397.94s)]
*  could only feed about half the population. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=402.88s)]
*  And then at the same time you've had this escalation in the war by Israel saying that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  it wants to finish Hamas off. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  You had the chief of staff today telling soldiers in fact Hamas has been greatly weakened, this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=412.64s)]
*  is not going to be an endless war. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=418.2s)]
*  But it really doesn't look like that in Gaza right now I have to say. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=420.88s)]
*  People are being squeezed into a smaller and smaller space and there have been many civilians [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=426.0s)]
*  killed during military operations over the weekend, Rita. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=430.82s)]
*  Thank you, Barbara Pletasha reporting there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0UCWS1lDxk&t=434.38s)]
