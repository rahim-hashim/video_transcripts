**BBC - The Latest:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8)
*  Well, let's talk about the aftermath of the weekend's US strikes on Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=0.0s)]
*  In Iran itself, the judiciary's news agency says three men accused of spying for Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=6.44s)]
*  have been hanged. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Reports also say Iran has arrested 700 people accused of having ties with Israel during [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=14.0s)]
*  the 12-day conflict. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=19.6s)]
*  With me is Parham Gabbadi from BBC Persian. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=21.12s)]
*  Parham, this is not something we're unused to with the Iranian regime putting people [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=24.84s)]
*  to death. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  What do we know about this instance? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  So it shows that how Iran is in a state of panic, Iranian authorities. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=33.24s)]
*  How can you arrest 700 spies in a matter of days? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  So it shows that Iranians, they want to show strength and that's what many Iranians have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  feared in the past few days, that the Iranian authorities, because they feel humiliated, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=48.24s)]
*  they will take revenge on their own people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=53.38s)]
*  But the point is that I was watching the Iranian state TV and they were lining up six men and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=56.06s)]
*  one of them was saying I was just a motorcycle delivery guy and he said that, yeah, what [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=61.34s)]
*  did you do? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=66.22s)]
*  Yeah, I was working for Mossad, delivering things here and there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=67.22s)]
*  So I mean, the infiltration, the collaboration should be at extremely high level, not just [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=71.26s)]
*  probably someone with a motorcycle because they knew in the past few days they've targeted, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=76.86s)]
*  so many nuclear scientists, high ranking commanders, some of them, one nuclear scientist survived [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=82.66s)]
*  one attack, was in hiding in one of the relatives house in a totally different city and he was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=89.3s)]
*  targeted there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  And that shows the level of intelligence that the Israelis had, that they even managed to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=96.02s)]
*  kill so many commanders on day one of the attack. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=100.72s)]
*  It's not just 700 people that you can easily find throughout Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=103.78s)]
*  But Iranians like Israelis, Iranian authorities like Israelis, they're celebrating, they're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=109.6s)]
*  claiming victory, they're in a celebratory mood. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=114.5s)]
*  But that's when you talk to people on the ground, the mood is far from that, especially [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  nowadays people have realized that Donald Trump is unpredictable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=125.66s)]
*  So they are saying that, you know, this war unexpectedly started, it came to an end quite [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=129.64s)]
*  unexpectedly, but we are not sure if it's going to start again tomorrow morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=136.24s)]
*  So they're still feeling very insecure. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=140.12s)]
*  This ceasefire for them isn't the time that they feel they can relax. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=142.62s)]
*  How much do they feel their leadership has been weakened by what has happened and what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  do they think the consequences of that might be? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=150.68s)]
*  So they feel it's volatile because, I mean, the ceasefire is holding, yes, Iran is not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  sending missiles and Israel is not sending fighter jets. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=158.12s)]
*  However, throughout Iran, in Zanjan, in capital Tehran, in the northern part of Iran, the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=160.84s)]
*  air defense system was activated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=165.16s)]
*  And again, that's another reason that many Iranians feel that this truce, this ceasefire [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=167.18s)]
*  is volatile because they see the sounds of, you know, air defense system in the system, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=171.88s)]
*  but they've lost their trust in the leadership. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=176.88s)]
*  They say that Khamenei, the supreme leader, was in the hiding since day one. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=179.0s)]
*  He just published some prerecorded videos, but he did not appear among his supporters [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=183.82s)]
*  even, even the closest to him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=189.68s)]
*  And the Iranian sky was defenseless. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=191.76s)]
*  Fighter jets, Israeli fighter jets, they maneuvered and they targeted all across Iran from north [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=194.6s)]
*  to south and east to west. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=199.14s)]
*  Parham, thank you very much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=200.88s)]
*  Parham Gabbadi from BBC Persia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqFSQRHjr8&t=202.32s)]
