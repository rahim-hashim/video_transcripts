*  Nearly four months since the fall of the Assad regime, Syria has appointed a new transitional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=0.0s)]
*  government. Despite a fragile security across the country, Syrians are experiencing political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=5.04s)]
*  freedoms they've been deprived of for five decades. But some fear the new Islamist-led [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=10.88s)]
*  government may be putting social and religious freedoms at risk. From Damascus, Lina Sinjab [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=16.22s)]
*  reports. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=21.16s)]
*  And action. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Behind the scene of a series in the making, Syrian soap operas gained fame across the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=24.16s)]
*  Arab world. They provide a reflection of society and its changing dynamics. After the fall [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=29.8s)]
*  of Assad, Syrians enjoyed political freedom, but fear for the social ones. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=36.6s)]
*  I received all the support and facilitation from the people in charge of the media and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=43.68s)]
*  the new government. But that doesn't mean anything in the long run. I am not optimistic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=47.96s)]
*  at all about the coming period regarding what we are seeing or experiencing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=53.0s)]
*  The Damascus University reflects the mixed background of Syria's society. Now, a new [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=59.8s)]
*  mosque is being built on campus without notice and without building permissions. Students [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=65.56s)]
*  don't think this is a priority. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=72.72s)]
*  We are not just Muslims in Syria. It is a diverse society with different sects. The [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=76.6s)]
*  The priority for us is to learn music, theatre, how to film. It is more important than building [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  a mosque. We already have prayer rooms for people to perform religious duties. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=85.76s)]
*  On the streets, there are a lot of warning signs. These preachers drive through Christian [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=92.44s)]
*  neighborhoods advocating for Islam through loudspeakers. Locals are not happy. The man [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=99.48s)]
*  arguing in this video tells the preacher, I am a Muslim and I don't want to hear your [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=107.48s)]
*  words. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=112.48s)]
*  Syria is known for its tolerant form of Islam, where the Sufi practice is more common. But [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=115.92s)]
*  even these Sufi worshippers are not safe. They were attacked and called infidels by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=121.44s)]
*  hardline Salafists. I asked an Imam if he worries a more radical Islam will take over. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=129.04s)]
*  It is impossible. Our society will not accept it. We have lived in harmony with different [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=136.44s)]
*  sects for years, even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly. No compulsion in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  religion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Syrians have been through a lot over the past decades. While the majority live in poverty, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=154.84s)]
*  they do enjoy religious and social freedoms. Now, some feel that these two are in the grip [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  of a new repressive Islamic order. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=165.84s)]
*  Lena Sinjab, BBC News, Damascus. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=168.84s)]
*  Lena spoke to me a little bit more about her time in Syria and what life is like now there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=172.4s)]
*  under the new regime. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=176.96s)]
*  It's incredible, something unheard of that people are experiencing. It's not only people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=179.08s)]
*  who have been liberated from prison. You feel that the whole country has been liberated. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=185.08s)]
*  Wherever you go, people are debating, talking, discussing, old and young, lots of events. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=190.0s)]
*  People feel that this is the first time in five decades they belong to the country, they [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=197.08s)]
*  have a say in the country, and they're not looking over their shoulder if somebody is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=201.6s)]
*  listening to them or if they're going to be in trouble if they speak their minds, basically. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=205.28s)]
*  There are concerns about their future freedoms, aren't there? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=211.16s)]
*  Certainly, because it's still not clear how the government is operating. They say one [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=214.68s)]
*  thing and the way they formed the government, they put the constitutional declaration, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=218.44s)]
*  it shows that there's only one man deciding who is president al-Sharah. There's no real [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=225.76s)]
*  inclusion of all spectrum of the society, only one woman minister represented. But also [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=230.76s)]
*  on a social level, although there hasn't been any written rules of imposing Islamic rule, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=237.2s)]
*  but there are lots of practices that are sending the signals that there is an Islamic influence [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=242.74s)]
*  especially Salafi one that could jeopardize the social freedoms that Syrians have always [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=248.72s)]
*  enjoyed. It's basically the whole way the society is inflicted because Syria is mainly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=254.08s)]
*  a secular city. There are more than 17 different sects and groups that are living really freely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=260.0s)]
*  together and in coexistence. Even the Sunni Muslims, they don't have a conservative or [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=266.6s)]
*  radical way of living. So women, even though if they are wearing the hijab, they are out [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=272.6s)]
*  in the public, they are in the souks, they are in the cafes, they are in their workplace. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=277.28s)]
*  And now you feel that there are new trend is coming in that being enforced not necessarily [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  by the government per se, but those affiliated to the government. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lacgrd8DYs&t=287.55999999999995s)]
