# What is the future of digital clones? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg)
*  Today I'm meeting a tech boss with an intriguing product, a virtual clone of himself. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=0.0s)]
*  Wayne's digital twin looks and talks just like him, answering potential customer questions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=8.88s)]
*  at a conference. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=15.8s)]
*  Hello Wayne, how are you? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=17.68s)]
*  Hey there, I'm doing great. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=21.92s)]
*  What's your favourite food? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=24.88s)]
*  And he's staying on message. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=26.64s)]
*  Ah, choosing a favourite is tough, but if I had to pick, I'd say the ability to create [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=28.88s)]
*  hyper-realistic avatars for real-time interaction is a real game changer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=35.76s)]
*  I asked him to try to sell himself as a product, so... [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=40.68s)]
*  Not your standard reply. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=46.08s)]
*  HeyGen is an AI video generator valued at $500 million. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  It creates AI-powered versions of you to act on your behalf online. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=53.32s)]
*  I can basically make a digital clone of myself and have him to do whatever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=59.08s)]
*  I maybe don't have time, but I know what should be done. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=64.28s)]
*  I just give him the knowledge and the goal and just go do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=67.08s)]
*  It's like telling an intern what to do. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=70.64s)]
*  He actually looks like he's delivering it quite convincingly, like a human would. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=72.6s)]
*  How have you done that? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=76.56s)]
*  So it's basically based on a real recording of myself and then we feed it to HeyGen AI [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=78.16s)]
*  to train and then they can talk in real-time like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=84.32s)]
*  So he knows what I look like, how I talk when I move, what kind of facial expression and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=88.12s)]
*  also my sound. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=93.0s)]
*  Clones, digital twins and AI agents are all products from the surge of start-ups promising [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=94.36s)]
*  to alleviate boring workloads and make you money whilst you sleep. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=100.56s)]
*  Ten people could be talking to you at once or 50 people, however many people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=105.28s)]
*  You can have these independent conversations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=109.08s)]
*  And so a question around that might be like, OK, but how do we know what it's talking about? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=113.0s)]
*  How do we feel confident and safe about the types of conversations it's having? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=117.12s)]
*  Well, it's only trained on data that I've given it, no other data. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=122.48s)]
*  So it can have these autonomous, agentic conversations, but in a kind of very controlled manner. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=127.44s)]
*  But we know that AI can hallucinate and make things up despite recent improvements. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=133.48s)]
*  What I like to focus on is AI twins that are based on a real human being that's tied to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=139.32s)]
*  that real human being and scale and augment and enrich the value of that real human being [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  in order to kind of create more returns to that human. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=149.76s)]
*  So that's what I'm a proponent of. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  There's lots of sort of ancillary things to this which are a little murky and potentially quite damaging. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=157.76s)]
*  If we gave our digital clones such agency, what if it makes the wrong decision? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=166.44s)]
*  It can trap you into sort of, you know, in this sort of, we call it effective echo chamber [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=171.72s)]
*  where it's just giving back what you want to hear. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=176.72s)]
*  Unlike humans, we disagree all the time, we ask questions, we challenge each other. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=179.6s)]
*  If you're always interacting with AI, it means that you can get stuck in this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=184.72s)]
*  So, and you know, the empathy that AI have is a pretend empathy because it doesn't have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=188.4s)]
*  real understanding of the human experience, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=193.16s)]
*  It's learned from, you know, written text, video, images and all of that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=195.84s)]
*  But it doesn't have real human experience. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=199.76s)]
*  It doesn't feel pain. It doesn't feel love in the way that human does. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=201.4s)]
*  It can pretend to understand it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=205.28s)]
*  But I think once you take the pretend for the real, that's when there is like issue that come up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=207.12s)]
*  But replicas are being designed to be increasingly true to life. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=212.64s)]
*  Some people talk like I might talk like this or move around a lot, whereas others are very [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  like controlled or like disciplined or whatever. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=221.0s)]
*  Do you look at the personal behaviour of someone in your AI model or is it all the same kind [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  of skeleton, if you like? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we are in the middle of being able to pick up those signals more and more. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And in the future, the avatar can, the model can predict, OK, we know Nick, we know how [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=236.04s)]
*  he usually talks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=241.0s)]
*  We can probably predict how Nick will talk when he is kind of angry or when he is very [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=242.28s)]
*  sad or when he is very excited. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Without even you showing us all of those, we will be focusing on making the avatar more [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=252.27999999999997s)]
*  expressive, more emotional. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=257.76s)]
*  What's next on your mind? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=260.08s)]
*  You can be digitally cloned and put your digital likeness to work for you too. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=261.88s)]
*  Helen Todd has been using her digital avatar, Helen 2.Odd, at conferences for the past couple [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=266.6s)]
*  of years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=272.92s)]
*  I love getting people's reactions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=274.08s)]
*  It's either like, oh my God, or like I want one, or somewhere in the middle. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=275.6s)]
*  But if I needed to add like communication layer or if I'm just not comfortable being [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=281.44s)]
*  on camera, like I can clone myself or if I'm brilliant but I'm a nervous wreck speaking, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=285.44s)]
*  I can clone myself and have my clone be a layer between me and the real person. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  But I think in the near future, everyone is going to have more hyper realistic clones. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=296.64s)]
*  There's a lot of people here trying to sell digital clones as a product or a service. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=301.68s)]
*  What would you say to the consumer here? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  I really love this book. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=308.56s)]
*  I think it came from Princeton called AI Snake Oil. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=309.64s)]
*  And you know, it's really captured the essence of it that people are trying to sell things [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=313.48s)]
*  that is like magical, amazing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  If you look at sort of the economic impact of AI, like the work from Darren Assamoglu [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  who just won Nobel Prize in Economic Science, he showed that the impact of AI on the economy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=324.26s)]
*  is actually very little. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=329.26s)]
*  And people can feel like, well, the AI can give them answer, but they should not forget [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=331.18s)]
*  that Google had also done something similar, maybe not give you a full essay, but can already [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  give people information at their fingertips. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=339.42s)]
*  But you see people watch cat video rather than go and try to understand quantum mechanics [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=342.62s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=347.06s)]
*  So having information, having intelligence at the fingertip doesn't always lead to sort [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=348.78s)]
*  of better life. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=353.38s)]
*  Like them or not, AI agents have arrived. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  What they mean for work, our relationships and our identity, we'll soon see. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=358.46s)]
*  If I could, I'd totally love pizza. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w21jw_yMjVg&t=365.53999999999996s)]
