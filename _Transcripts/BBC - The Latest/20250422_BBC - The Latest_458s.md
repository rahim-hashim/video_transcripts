# Pope Francis's funeral to be held on Saturday, Vatican says | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw)
*  Hello and welcome to the Vatican in Rome where it has been announced that the funeral of Pope Francis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=0.0s)]
*  will take place on Saturday. This as many thousands of people continue to come to the Vatican. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The Pontiff died on Monday morning at the age of 88. He suffered a stroke and then subsequent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=14.4s)]
*  heart failure. We'll take a look at these live pictures. These are the current scene now in St [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=21.44s)]
*  Peter's Square where mourners from around the world are arriving to pay their respects. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=27.2s)]
*  Well Pope Francis last appeared in public on Sunday for an Easter blessing in front of crowds [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=33.84s)]
*  and worshipers. That came after weeks of poor health and hospitalization with pneumonia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=39.6s)]
*  So let's briefly talk you through the choreography in the coming days and weeks because the death of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=47.04s)]
*  the Pope set off a chain of events that have been planned for many many years. Pope Francis' body is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=53.12s)]
*  now resting in a chapel at his St Martha residence. So take a look at these. These are some of the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=59.28s)]
*  official pictures we've received from there. The Pope will then be moved to St Peter's Basilica [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=65.6s)]
*  to lie in state on Wednesday morning. That is where his funeral will be held and the funeral mass [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=71.92s)]
*  will take place just outside the Basilica in St Peter's Square. Well as for the leadership [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=79.68s)]
*  of the church the vote to select a new pope will take place here at the Sistine Chapel in the coming [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=86.48s)]
*  weeks. Well over the coming hours we will look back at the life and legacy of the pope and look [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  ahead to the future of the Catholic Church. First though here's our Rome correspondent Sarah Ramesford. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Prayers for a pope who touched the hearts of many millions all over the world and who is being [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=109.84s)]
*  remembered here in Rome with real affection. Pope Francis had been ill for many weeks but his death [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=117.2s)]
*  was still a shock to many who had seen him right here just a day before outside St Peter's. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  He'd appeared after the Easter Sunday mass. His frailty after a long battle with pneumonia was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=131.68s)]
*  clear to see but this is a holy year for Catholics and being with them at Easter was hugely important [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  to the pope. As his death was announced and bells tolled over the Vatican, Catholics shared their [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=145.28s)]
*  Catholics shared their memories. He put a lot of effort into people inside and outside the church [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=158.96s)]
*  realized that we can communicate and help each other and that's the most basic and important [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=165.44s)]
*  thing that he left behind communication and giving each other a hand to help. In one of many ancient [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=170.16s)]
*  rituals to come the pope's apartment has been sealed, his ring smashed, the papal seat is now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=177.44s)]
*  officially vacant until a conclave and an election and the flags here have been lowered [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=184.48s)]
*  for nine days of official mourning. Far from Rome in Argentina the loss is felt keenly. This is the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  country where Pope Francis was born to Italian immigrants, one reason why he always urged [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  compassion for migrants across the world. He was more than a pope, he was a politician, he was [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=210.88s)]
*  humanitarian, he represented even the ones that didn't believe in God and made everyone feel so [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  hurt. In London too at Westminster Cathedral there were prayers, candles and even tears. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  I think he was wonderful, his simplicity, his kindness, his care of people. I loved the fact [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=235.04s)]
*  that he lived in the hospital and didn't want to sleep in all the smart places you know that they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  gave him and that he was a very simple man. The pope's last testament has now been revealed, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=247.28s)]
*  remembering those who prayed for him and offering up his own suffering for peace in the world [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=253.52s)]
*  and fraternity among peoples. It included his request to be buried not in the Vatican [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=260.0s)]
*  but in a church where he liked to pray in central Rome and a pope of famously simple tastes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=266.72s)]
*  wants his tomb marked only with his name. Well as I mentioned earlier the passing of a pope sets off [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=274.0s)]
*  a chain of events, a series of events which are carefully planned, orchestrated and choreographed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=282.64s)]
*  and to talk more through all of this I'm joined by our former Rome correspondent Mark Lowen and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=289.44s)]
*  Mark you have covered these events before, tell me exactly what we can expect over the coming days [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=294.32s)]
*  now that we know the date of the funeral. Well the first thing to take to be planned is tomorrow [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=301.2s)]
*  morning, Wednesday morning when the pope's coffin will be moved to St Peter's Basilica where it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=305.92s)]
*  will be lying there for a few days for pilgrims and the faithful to come and visit and see him [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=313.76s)]
*  in the open casket. That will continue until Saturday when the funeral is planned for 10am [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  local time that is 0900 BST and that funeral will be attended by royalty, by heads of state, we [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=327.44s)]
*  already know that Emmanuel Macron the president of France has said he will be there, President [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=335.12s)]
*  Trump will be there with Melania as well the first lady, there will be leaders from across the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=338.72s)]
*  world going to that funeral. The coffin at the end of the funeral will be moved to the Basilica [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  di Santa Maria Maggiore which is on the other side of Rome and that is where Pope Francis said he [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  wants to be buried. Now he will become the first pope to be buried there and not in the Vatican [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=354.72s)]
*  for more than a century. It is a church, it is a basilica which he feels very close to, he would [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=359.92s)]
*  always stop to pray there at the end of a papal visit for example to pray to an icon of Mary [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=364.72s)]
*  and he has left quite detailed instructions of how he wants to be buried in a simple tomb, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=370.48s)]
*  he wants to be put in a coffin made of wood and zinc and there have only been six popes actually [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  who have been buried outside the Vatican so that's quite consequential and then there will be a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  little pause of about nine days in which there will be people coming here to pay their respects, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  to mourn him and then the conclave begins which is the process in which the cardinals, the cardinal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=392.0s)]
*  electors, around 138 of them will come here to Rome and they will go inside the Sistine Chapel, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=398.88s)]
*  inside the Vatican, inside Vatican City behind us and there they will begin that process, that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=405.36s)]
*  deeply secretive, deeply holy process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church. And there [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=410.96s)]
*  will be so many hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, mourners and tourists expected here over the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=415.92s)]
*  coming days. Yeah I mean when John Paul II died who was also an incredibly popular pope, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=422.0s)]
*  it was thought that there were over a million pilgrims and faithful who came to Rome to pay [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  their respects, to see his open casket. Pope Francis was a superstar pope in the eyes of many, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  we're already seeing thousands of people coming here. If we look down at St Peter's Square we [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  can see people beginning to kind of go towards the Basilica of St Peter's Basilica even before [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=446.24s)]
*  the casket goes inside that building. We will expect huge crowds here, he is somebody who [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  who draws the crowds in their masses. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx8OsWgF-uw&t=456.08000000000004s)]
