# Trump’s trade war will damage growth OECD warns | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc)
*  We start with a warning over the state of the global economy in the wake of President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's tariff trade war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=5.44s)]
*  As investors and businesses around the world struggle to keep on top of the latest developments [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=7.98s)]
*  of Donald Trump's trade policy, one influential organization has unequivocally said that tariffs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=12.96s)]
*  will be bad for global economic growth and living standards. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=18.92s)]
*  The leading economic think tank, the OECD, has cut its forecasts, saying the global economy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=23.68s)]
*  will only grow by 3.1% this year. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=29.0s)]
*  The biggest changes will be felt in the United States' neighbors, with Mexico's economy set [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=32.96s)]
*  to shrink by 1.3% this year, which compares to growth of 1.2% in the previous forecast [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=38.08s)]
*  made in December. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  And Canada will still grow, but only by 0.7% rather than the 2% that was previously predicted. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=47.16s)]
*  This is all based on the assumption that President Trump goes ahead with tariffs of 25% on all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  goods from both neighbors at the start of April. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=61.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, the US has also been downgraded to growth of 2.2% this year and 1.6% in 2026. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=64.96s)]
*  Today, Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has called for economic collaboration rather [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=72.96s)]
*  than confrontation on his first overseas trip since taking office last week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  During a press conference with the French President Emmanuel Macron, Mark Carney said [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  that Canada must reinforce ties with reliable allies in the face of economic turmoil. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe works enthusiastically with Canada, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=95.64s)]
*  the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=102.72s)]
*  possible relations with the United States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  Canada is a reliable, trustworthy and strong partner of France, which shares our values [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  and lives them through action during this age of economic and geopolitical crises. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  In the US itself, fears over a possible recession continue. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  The latest retail data shows sales rising at just 0.2% last month, which is less than [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=135.64s)]
*  expected suggesting the economy is growing at a rather moderate pace. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=141.56s)]
*  This all coming ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=146.16s)]
*  Let's head over to New York now and speak to our North American Business Correspondent [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=149.64s)]
*  Michelle Fleury. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Michelle, are people drawing a link between this week's retail sales growth and Donald [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=154.4s)]
*  Trump's policies? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=160.16s)]
*  Tanc, I think economists are looking at the data and they're asking themselves the question, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=163.16s)]
*  is this as a result of these policy shocks that we're seeing at the moment or is it something [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=168.2s)]
*  a trend that was kind of already in train before we started to get these mass layoffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=174.0s)]
*  at the federal level and also the escalating trade wars? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=179.7s)]
*  And I think the conclusion is it's a little mix of both because if you take today's retail [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  sales figures, there was a sharp drop in January. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=187.48s)]
*  That was really before we saw kind of some of these policies at the federal level go [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=190.52s)]
*  into effect. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=195.84s)]
*  But then if you take what's happened in February, the lack of a strong kind of reversal or a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=197.14s)]
*  rebound suggests that that's where you get the uncertainty of policy starting to kind [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=201.56s)]
*  of affect what consumers are doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=207.38s)]
*  You saw a sort of slightly cautious approach, particularly when it came to dining out and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=210.44s)]
*  going to bars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=214.2s)]
*  Indeed, and of course most economists will tell you that tariffs are a lose-lose for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=215.6s)]
*  both sides. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=221.32s)]
*  Donald Trump himself has even acknowledged they could be economically damaging. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=222.32s)]
*  I suppose the question, the open question is how much damage he thinks they're actually [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=226.44s)]
*  worth. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you've heard Donald Trump and some of his cabinet members say that the prize [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  at the end will be worth it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=238.72s)]
*  There are various economists sort of stepping out there and saying they question that kind [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=241.36s)]
*  of wisdom. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  And there are people saying actually when you get trade wars, the kind of damage that's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=249.0s)]
*  done maybe will not be offset by sort of some of the deregulation or tax cuts that the Trump [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=253.24s)]
*  administration is promising further down the road. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=258.48s)]
*  What's been interesting is obviously we've seen a lot of volatility on financial markets [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=262.44s)]
*  and there was some question as to whether the markets could perhaps rein in the president [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=267.64s)]
*  when it comes to his kind of escalating trade war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=271.68s)]
*  Now a short time ago I spoke to Desmond Lashman, he's a senior fellow at the American Enterprise [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=274.0s)]
*  Institute. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=279.24s)]
*  He's also a former deputy director at the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=280.24s)]
*  he said he believes the US markets could force Trump to change course on tariffs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=283.84s)]
*  Well we've already had very large losses. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=289.44s)]
*  We've had something like 10% of the value of the stock market wiped out in a matter [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=292.32s)]
*  of three weeks, which is a very rapid move. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=296.76s)]
*  Something like five trillion dollars of wealth has evaporated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=300.0s)]
*  My expectation is if the stock market falls another 10% or so, Trump will have no alternative [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=305.44s)]
*  but to make a U-turn because there'll be a lot of pain from the stock market losses and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=312.56s)]
*  that in fact can feed into the economy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=320.0s)]
*  We've already seen consumer confidence very weak. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=323.52s)]
*  If you have a 20% decline in the stock market, consumers are going to pull back, the economy's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=326.84s)]
*  going to slow down, Trump's holes are going to sag. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  He'll have no alternative but to make a U-turn on his policies. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=336.96s)]
*  So there you have that bet. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=341.84s)]
*  He thinks that the markets could force Trump back to the negotiating table sooner rather [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=344.64s)]
*  than later. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=348.64s)]
*  Whether or not that happens, the Federal Reserve still has a big challenge ahead of it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=350.12s)]
*  They meet this Wednesday to set interest rates. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=354.76s)]
*  Nobody expects a change in the level but they are dealing with the tricky challenge and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=356.88s)]
*  that is worrying about inflation on the one hand but also a potential slowdown on the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=360.72s)]
*  other. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=364.68s)]
*  Indeed, we await the outcome of their latest meeting happening on Wednesday. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=365.68s)]
*  Michelle Flurry in New York, thank you very much. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBSQqZyebc&t=368.96s)]
