Video Description: Two Israeli soldiers have been killed, and six others injured, in a shooting at an army checkpoint in the occupied West Bank.
 
The attack took place in the Palestinian city of Tubas, and comes as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said a nearby camp in the city of Jenin is going in a “catastrophic direction”, as the Israeli military continues its operation there.
 
The army said it has killed 50 people there so far, but Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the operation is aimed at ethnic cleansing, and has called on the US to intervene. 
 
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is set to become the first foreign leader to meet President Donald Trump at the White House in his second term later on Tuesday, at a critical juncture for the Gaza ceasefire.

# Two Israeli soldiers killed in West Bank shooting | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw)
*  Let's take you to the Middle East now. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed, six others injured in a shooting attack on an army checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=0.0s)]
*  It took place in the north in the Palestinian city of Tubis and it comes as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=8.0s)]
*  You'll know that Ms. Amra has said a nearby camp in the city of Jenin is going in a catastrophic direction as the Israeli military continues its operation there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=15.0s)]
*  The army says it's killed 50 people there so far. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=24.0s)]
*  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the operation is aimed at ethnic cleansing and has called on the US to intervene. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=27.0s)]
*  We have some latest pictures for you from the scene of today's attack at that army checkpoint. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=34.0s)]
*  And to remind you as well, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is right now in the United States and he's going to be meeting with President Trump later today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=40.0s)]
*  We are again at a critical juncture for the Gaza ceasefire and the next phases of that as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=48.0s)]
*  So let's take you to Jerusalem and join our correspondent there, Wera Davis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=55.0s)]
*  First, Wera, can you put into context for us what is happening in Jenin at the moment? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=59.0s)]
*  Yeah, for all the relative calm in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire and the occupied West Bank, things have been going from worse to worse. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=65.0s)]
*  According to local sources, more than 70 Palestinians have been killed since the start of January. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=74.0s)]
*  As a result, mainly of the increased Israeli military activity against armed gangs like Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian militants in the city of Jenin. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=80.0s)]
*  Israeli troops for several days now have been surrounding what's known as the Jenin refugee camp, destroying buildings and trying to flush out the militants in their woods. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=92.0s)]
*  In other nearby parts of the West Bank, as you've just been saying there, there have been casualties over the last few weeks, including in the last few hours. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=102.0s)]
*  The Israeli military patrol was ambushed. Several people were injured. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=111.0s)]
*  And our understanding is that two soldiers have been killed as well as the attacker. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=115.0s)]
*  So a lot of tension in the occupied West Bank, but perhaps isn't getting as much attention as it might get because, of course, of the ongoing war in Gaza, despite the ceasefire there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=120.0s)]
*  And while we're talking about that and the ceasefire, where are what are the expectations in Israel of this meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump due to take place in about nine hours time? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, some Israeli media outlets are calling it the most important meeting between a president and a prime minister for decades. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=143.0s)]
*  That might be slightly overdoing it, but it shows what is at stake. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=149.0s)]
*  And of course, now we're coming to the end of the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza that's had tangible benefits. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=152.0s)]
*  The release of 18 hostages, more than 500 Palestinian prisoners, more aid getting into Gaza, injured people getting out of Gaza, general support on both sides for a continuation of the ceasefire. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=158.0s)]
*  But Mr. Netanyahu is perhaps reluctant. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=170.0s)]
*  He's certainly got ministers to the right of him who want the war to resume because their argument is that Hamas is not yet militarily defeated and that has to be achieved before the war can end. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=173.0s)]
*  Yet Mr. Trump, we know, wants the war to finish because he's got wider and bigger plans in the region, particularly trying to get some sort of historic deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=184.0s)]
*  So even though Mr. Trump is a very big ally of Israel and I'm sure the mood music publicly will be very good, there are tensions between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=195.0s)]
*  And that sort of move to the vital second phase of the ceasefire is what is at stake. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=205.0s)]
*  Waryl, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us from Jerusalem. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=213.0s)]
*  Let's speak now to Dr. Doron Avital, who was a former Knesset member and former Israeli Special Forces commander as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=216.0s)]
*  Dr. Avital, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=223.0s)]
*  Waryl, just saying that some in Israel say this meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump is one of the most important historically that we've seen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=225.0s)]
*  Not everyone agrees, but what's your view? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=235.0s)]
*  How important do you see this meeting in Washington today as being? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=238.0s)]
*  No, I think it's critical. I think it comes in a critical junction in terms of the situation in Gaza, in terms of the hostage deal, in terms of the public opinion in favor of the hostage deal, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=242.0s)]
*  and in terms of the political constraint in Israel, and in terms of the bigger picture in the Middle East concerning Trump's vision, not only his vision, but the corridor about Saudi Arabia normalization. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=252.0s)]
*  Important points at stake, three points, the Gaza hostage deal and the fate of Gaza, Saudi Arabia normalization, and of course Iran that all the time looms in the background. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=263.0s)]
*  Does the Israeli public at the moment support the continuation of the ceasefire and the next phases? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=273.0s)]
*  I think they do. I think they do. You can hear different voices, but my feeling does very emotional release of the women soldiers and then other captives. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=280.0s)]
*  It really did something to the Israeli public. They really realized maybe for the first time how close in such a short distance the hostages are there and the possibility of seeing them back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=292.0s)]
*  I think there would be a real outcry in Israeli public if this won't go forward. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=302.0s)]
*  And everybody understands the political constraint that Netanyahu is in, but I think there would be no forgiveness for him if it would seem as if we decided to break out of the framework of the deal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=307.0s)]
*  My feeling the public is for the hostage. But Dr. Avetel, in terms of those political constraints you mentioned, if hardliners like Ben Gavir and Smotrich resign, can the Netanyahu coalition government continue to stand? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=320.0s)]
*  Not for long. I mean, he is ensured by the opposition, but Yael Apid, the head of the opposition and Benny Gantz, the other leader in the opposition camp, that they would stand behind him in this deal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=335.0s)]
*  But in the long run, when you have to deliver the budget, by the way, also the Orthodox, not the religious Zionists, the Orthodox parties proclaimed that they declared that they would be behind the deal. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=349.0s)]
*  But in the long run, if the extreme right-wingers, Smotrich and Ben Gavir, leave the government, in the long run we'll go to election, it will be the collapse of the coalition. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=359.0s)]
*  This is his fear. So he is maneuvering. His maneuvering space is very limited now between Trump, between the constraints here, between the public, very little maneuvering space. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=369.0s)]
*  Therefore, I think Trump is in a position to dictate to them, with which of his aid, how to go forward. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=380.0s)]
*  Can I ask you, Dr. Avital, about what is going on in the West Bank, which is how I started my conversation with Wira and the UN saying, you know, there is a dangerous escalation, there are catastrophic direction that the Janine refugee camp is moving in. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=388.0s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority Foreign Affairs Department have said civilians are being displaced under armed threat, entire neighborhoods are being destroyed with explosives. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=402.0s)]
*  They say there is a flagrant violation of international law taking place by the IDF in the occupied West Bank. What is the objectives of the IDF at the moment? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=412.0s)]
*  First of all, we have to realize that Janine in the Northern Samaria was a hotbed of terror also before the 7th of October. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=423.0s)]
*  And now it's picking up in a dangerous direction. It's true that there were a few more weeks ago there was an attempt to introduce the Palestinian Authority, the security forces of the Palestinian Authority, that they would instill some order and try to contain those terrorist acts. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=431.0s)]
*  There is a fear that the energy that if there is a ceasefire and it continues in Gaza, that the energy of terror would go to the Northern Samaria. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=448.0s)]
*  So Israel is sort of a preemptive move, try to contain it. I don't think the displacement is something, it's also a local displacement in order to maneuver and to conduct the military operation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=458.0s)]
*  We don't have to read more than this to that, but the Northern Samaria is an issue. We saw it today and we are trying to contain it. I hope it would work. Yes, it's a problem. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wGyZAgRTw&t=471.0s)]
