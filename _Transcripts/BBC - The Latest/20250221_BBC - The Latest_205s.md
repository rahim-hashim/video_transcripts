Video Description: Apple has removed its highest level data security tool from customers in the UK, after the government demanded access to user data.

Advanced Data Protection (ADP) means only account holders can view items such as photos or documents they have stored online through a process known as end-to-end encryption.

But earlier this month the UK government asked for the right to see the data, which currently not even Apple can access.

Now the tech giant has decided it will no longer be possible to activate ADP in the UK.

It means eventually not all UK customer data stored on iCloud - Apple's cloud storage service - will be fully encrypted.

# Apple pulls data protection tool after UK government security row | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8)
*  Apple is taking the unprecedented step of removing its highest-level data security tool [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=0.0s)]
*  from customers in the UK. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Viewers might remember in the last couple of weeks we covered this story after the UK [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=9.92s)]
*  government demanded access to user data and we explained that possibly it would lead to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=16.36s)]
*  Apple taking this step of moving its highest-level data security tool. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=21.76s)]
*  This is called Advanced Data Protection. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=27.2s)]
*  Let's find out a little bit more about this story and go to our senior technology reporter [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=31.48s)]
*  Graham Fraser who's in Glasgow. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=35.46s)]
*  First of all explain for us what this data security tool does. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=38.8s)]
*  Well as you say this tool is called Advanced Data Protection. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=42.96s)]
*  It's an opt-in service for Apple customers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=47.86s)]
*  It applies end-to-end encryption on all their photos and documents if they wanted to. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=49.92s)]
*  Now only the account holder would have access to this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  Not even Apple had access to it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=59.72s)]
*  Now a couple of weeks ago it emerged that the UK government had asked for the right [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=62.72s)]
*  to see this data. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=67.0s)]
*  This was served under the Home Office under an Act which was compelling firms to provide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=68.52s)]
*  information to law enforcement agencies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  At that time Apple did not comment but they have consistently said that they will not [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  back doors to their encryption services because that could allow so-called bad actors, namely [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=82.4s)]
*  hackers to also find a way in. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  Now as of today the tech giant said it's no longer possible to activate Advanced Data [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=90.84s)]
*  Protection in the UK and for existing customers of it it will start to be pulled away from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  them and will no longer have access to it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=103.4s)]
*  Apple have said they're gravely disappointed that this security feature will no longer [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  be available to UK customers and they added that as we've seen many times before we have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=110.72s)]
*  never built a back door or master key to any of our products and we never will. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=115.6s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=120.44s)]
*  Well it means that eventually no data stored on the iCloud in the UK will be encrypted. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=121.44s)]
*  It will therefore be accessible to Apple and it will also be made shareable to law enforcement [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=126.92s)]
*  agencies if Apple were issued a warrant. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=132.04s)]
*  Has there been any response yet from the government Graham and what do you think this means for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=135.44s)]
*  Apple's business here in the UK? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=140.32s)]
*  Well there has been no response yet to this breaking story by the UK government. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=142.4s)]
*  We have had response from Professor Alan Woodward who is a cyber security expert at Surrey University. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=148.16s)]
*  He said it was a very disappointing development which amounted to an act of self-harm by the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=155.16s)]
*  government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=160.64s)]
*  He went on to say that all the UK government has achieved in this is to weaken online security [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=161.64s)]
*  and the privacy of UK based users and he added that it was naive of the UK government to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  think that it could tell a US technology company what to do globally. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  In terms of Apple's business well obviously we will have to wait and see what impact it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=180.32s)]
*  will have. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=186.0s)]
*  Some customers of course will choose Apple products so that they could have access to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  this encryption and they no longer will be able to have this on their accounts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  We will find out in the coming months what impact it will have on their business. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ANw3Fhnbv8&t=198.16000000000003s)]
