*  We start with our breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump has told the BBC that the UK is way out of line [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=1.6s)]
*  when it comes to trading with the US [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=6.72s)]
*  and that tariffs might be imposed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=8.92s)]
*  But he said his main aim is the European Union, which he has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=11.52s)]
*  warned will face import taxes soon, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=14.96s)]
*  accusing the EU of not buying anything from the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=18.28s)]
*  Let's have a listen to what President Trump told [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=22.92s)]
*  our correspondent, Nomi Iqbal, during a press [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=25.12s)]
*  at Joint Base Andrews. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=27.84s)]
*  They don't take our cars. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=57.84s)]
*  They don't take our farm products. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=59.36000000000001s)]
*  They take almost nothing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=60.96s)]
*  And we take everything from them, millions of cars, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  tremendous amounts of food and farm products. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  So the UK is way out of line. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  And we'll say the UK, but European Union, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=70.88000000000001s)]
*  is really out of line. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=75.44s)]
*  UK is out of line, but I'm sure that would, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=76.48s)]
*  I think that one could be worked out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=79.28s)]
*  But the European Union is, it's an atrocity, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  what they've done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=86.84s)]
*  What's the relationship with the EU? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=87.84s)]
*  Well, Prime Minister Starm has been very nice. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=91.44s)]
*  We've had a couple of meetings. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=93.68s)]
*  We've had numerous phone calls. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=95.0s)]
*  We're getting along very well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=96.76s)]
*  We'll see whether or not we can balance out our budget. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=98.72s)]
*  With the European Union, it's $350 billion deficit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=101.72s)]
*  So obviously, something's going to take place there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=108.04s)]
*  Well, those comments from President Trump on the United [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=110.36s)]

*  Despite sharing a free trade pact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=139.32s)]
*  And he hit China with a 10% tariff, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  in addition to existing levies brought in by Joe Biden. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=146.0s)]
*  All three countries have vowed retaliation, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  prompting concerns of a trade war and rising prices. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  But on his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=157.44s)]
*  we will make America great again, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=160.56s)]
*  and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=162.84s)]
*  The issue of tariffs is likely to be discussed [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqWcmB1FTk&t=167.76000000000002s)]
