Video Description: Australian PM Anthony Albanese wins re-election but it is unclear yet if he has a majority, local networks say based on early vote counts.

Early results suggest Albanese and his Australian Labor Party benefited from swings across the country away from Peter Dutton's Liberal-National Coalition.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk)
*  Let's bring you some breaking news just into us from Australia now. The state broadcaster ABC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=0.0s)]
*  News have been reporting that the incumbent Labour Party have certainly won power in a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=6.32s)]
*  nationwide federal election. This means that the incumbent Labour Party with the Prime Minister [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=11.68s)]
*  Anthony Albanese will be staying in power. That news just into us from ABC, the Australian state [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=16.56s)]
*  broadcaster, projecting that the incumbent Labour Party have certainly won power in today's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=23.2s)]
*  elections. Let's go to my colleague Steve Lyne who's following all the developments from Sydney. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Steve, what more do we know? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, this news coming in a lot sooner than we were expecting. ABC, the local news network here [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=38.24s)]
*  that typically calls elections are the ones that have announced this just a short while ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=43.04s)]
*  And Anthony Green, the voice of Australian elections for the last 30 years. This is his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=48.0s)]
*  last election where he's calling the results and he has come out to say that he projects that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=52.08s)]
*  Labour and Anthony Albanese will be returning to government. Now we can get some immediate reaction [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  right here in Sydney with my guest Dr Peter Chen from the University of Sydney. Peter, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=63.36s)]
*  great to have you on at this and for being ready to go. It's quite a surprise. It all took us by [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  surprise. We knew in previous elections at nine o'clock between nine and ten they had been called [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=73.92s)]
*  but this came even before E30. Yes, it's quite a surprise because there have been a lot of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=78.64s)]
*  speculation that it might have been a close fun thing with commentators speculating that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=82.56s)]
*  Labour was likely to form government again but possibly a minority government and would need [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=88.48s)]
*  to get the support of the cross benches. So the rapidity to which this has been called and news.com.au [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=92.64s)]
*  part of the Murdoch stable, we're calling it just after a quarter past eight which is only [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=99.28s)]
*  about 15 minutes after the polls are closed in Western Australia. So I had to put my beer down [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=105.04s)]
*  which is something Australians don't often do. Thanks very much for making it back here. We [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  were speaking to you earlier as well about some of the issues surrounding this election but just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  to come back to what this result has come to us so quickly, Anthony Green who's been calling [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=122.0s)]
*  elections here in Australia for 30 years and not one he's going to want to have gotten wrong [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=128.16s)]
*  seeing as it's his last. No that's right and going into the election we saw that for the ALP [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=133.04s)]
*  they had about seven seats where the margin that they held them by was three percent or less and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=140.48s)]
*  the coalition came in with about 12. So based on the polling close to the election day it did look [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  like the ALP were going to hold those seats and possibly grab a few more and the election was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=151.84s)]
*  really the coalitions to lose and certainly we've seen that it's likely that the ALP is picking up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  a couple of Greens held seats in Queensland. The coalition are losing seats, the independents and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=164.96s)]
*  particularly the teal type independents seem to be doing well and even though the LNP had lost votes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=170.16s)]
*  out to the right wing to One Nation and the Trumpets for Patriots those preference will come back to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=177.6s)]
*  them but even with those preferences it looks like they haven't managed to sneak back into [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=183.28s)]
*  government and that would have been a continuity of a government that they would previously [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=187.6s)]
*  been in before the election of the Labor Party for about nine years. So it's going to be a big [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  disappointment for Peter Dutton who also it looks like possibly might lose his own seat and obviously [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=197.92s)]
*  your viewers will be reminded of the outcome in the Canadian election where the the centre left [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=205.04s)]
*  party the Liberals came back into power and the key opponent who was on track to win that election [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  only a few months prior lost his own seat in that process. Yes and we'll get into a bit about what [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  caused that and what perhaps had an influence here as well in Australia. We're just looking at some [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=223.44s)]
*  live images here we're just showing our viewers from the headquarters of the Labor Party Anthony [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Albanese's party they'll certainly be in good cheer for this outcome and for it to come so quickly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=232.96s)]
*  What do you think they will put down as what got them over the line or what really spurred them on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=238.88s)]
*  to win this election? Yes well they're likely to say it was their kind of positive agenda that was [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=244.08s)]
*  focused on things about cost of living and housing but I think deep down in their heart of hearts they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  have to recognise that we did have a somewhat lacklustre election. Only a few months ago it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=254.08s)]
*  seemed certain that Anthony Albanese was going to lose the election and that Peter Dutton was going [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=260.16s)]
*  to win but Peter Dutton's negatives I think have really counted against him and Labor has to recognise [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=264.8s)]
*  that they had an opponent who on some levels was very politically canny, very sophisticated in some [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=272.48s)]
*  areas but had a lot of negatives and the big one of course was with younger people and with women. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFlHP3U2Bk&t=278.56s)]
