Video Description: The deaths of 15 people including paramedics in a convoy in Gaza have been blamed on Israel's military, according to the UN.

Mourners gathered at a funeral on Monday after the bodies were found in a mass grave.

The Israeli military said its troops had fired on vehicles "advancing suspiciously" without headlights or emergency signals and that a Hamas operative and other militants were among those killed on 23 March, but it did not offer any comment on the accounts of bodies being gathered up and buried in the sand.

Meanwhile, the US has said it expects "all parties on the ground" in Gaza to comply with international humanitarian law but declined to confirm whether it was carrying out its own assessment into the deaths.

*  We're going to return to events in the Middle East. The UN's children's agency UNICEF says at least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=0.0s)]
*  322 children are reported to have been killed in the two weeks since Israel's bombardment resumed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=6.08s)]

*  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said they've received no response from Israel to their request [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  for information on the attack that killed 15 aid workers in Gaza. The UN says eight Palestinian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=23.28s)]
*  Red Crescent medical workers, one UN staff member and six civil defence workers were killed. Five [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=29.44s)]
*  ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle were hit one by one in the Al Hashashin area on March [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=36.4s)]
*  23rd. I've been speaking to our Middle East correspondent Dan Johnson in Jerusalem and I [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=43.52s)]
*  asked him what justification Israel is giving for targeting a humanitarian convoy. Israel's version [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=47.92s)]
*  of this incident is that it was opening fire on Hamas fighters, that it was targeting somebody [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=55.36s)]
*  in amongst those vehicles who it believed had been part of the October the 7th attacks on Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=62.88s)]
*  It says that it killed a Hamas figure as part of this incident but we don't know where his body is, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=69.68s)]
*  if that is true. His body is not amongst those that have been recovered in the last 48 hours by the UN [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=76.32s)]
*  and other international organisations, the Red Crescent and others who are involved in this, who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=83.04s)]
*  had medics and rescue teams caught up in this. We don't know if his body was taken by the IDF and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=88.0s)]
*  is perhaps being held. The Israeli military's justification for this attack is that they were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=95.12s)]
*  taking out what they describe as a terrorist and that the medics who were caught up in this were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  just inadvertently in the way but Israel is being accused once again of being careless with the live [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  innocent Palestinians, indeed Palestinian response emergency workers who should have had the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=113.36s)]
*  protections of international law and the Geneva Conventions. Although we understand they had not [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=118.88s)]
*  pre-cleared their access to that area, they were responding to reports of firing and injuries in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=124.32s)]
*  that area close to Raffa but they weren't able to guarantee safe passage with the Israelis when [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=131.2s)]
*  their ambulances and firetruck came under fire. It's taken a long time for the details of this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  incident to come out, more than a week before their bodies were found buried in sand and the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=142.16s)]
*  international organisations involved are saying that the fact that their vehicles and bodies were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=147.84s)]
*  dug into the sand, were buried, is part of Israel's attempt to cover up exactly what has happened [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=155.04s)]
*  here. There are calls for an investigation that the Israeli authorities haven't even guaranteed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=160.0s)]
*  that that will take place yet but they have said they didn't just randomly open fire on ambulances [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=164.56s)]
*  and emergency teams. They say that those vehicles were moving suspiciously, that they didn't have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=170.32s)]
*  their headlights or emergency lights illuminated and that it perhaps wasn't clear to the soldiers [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=174.64s)]
*  exactly what vehicles they were opening fire on. The international agencies are saying that those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=179.92s)]
*  vehicles were clearly marked and it should have been obvious to the soldiers that they were not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  part of this conflict. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JL0ybSVSU&t=187.84s)]
