# Canada's PM Mark Carney calls snap election | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk)
*  So let's turn to Canada because the new Prime Minister is expected to announce a snap election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=0.0s)]
*  He has been visiting the country's Governor General and he has just come out so let's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=5.32s)]
*  cross over live now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=10.64s)]
*  A few months ago I was at a rink in Edmonton where I'd learned to play hockey. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=11.64s)]
*  That's about as far as you can get from the grandeur of Rideau Hall. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=17.2s)]
*  And I was there because I was putting up my hand to run for the leadership of the Liberal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=22.56s)]
*  Party of Canada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=26.82s)]
*  And I was doing that because I knew our country needed to take action. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=28.94s)]
*  We needed to act to fix our economy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  We needed to act to fight the Americans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=38.42s)]
*  We needed to act to deal with Donald Trump's terrorists. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=42.14s)]
*  Nine days ago, our new government made a pledge and we immediately took action. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=46.84s)]
*  This week, we have signed a new agreement on national defence with Australia to protect [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=59.24s)]
*  Canada. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=67.76s)]
*  We have strengthened our relations in terms of security with France and the United Kingdom [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=68.76s)]
*  to protect Canadians. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=76.36s)]
*  We have launched discussions on new trade agreements with the United Kingdom. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  We are eliminating attacks on foreign and consumer businesses for farmers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And the division that it was creating amongst Canadians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=98.16s)]
*  Because we are stronger together. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=103.16s)]
*  We reversed the increase in the capital gains tax so that builders are encouraged to take [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=107.86s)]
*  risks and be rewarded when they succeed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=112.44s)]
*  When I met with the premiers in Ottawa on Friday, we agreed to eliminate barriers to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  trade and mobility inside our country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  And the federal government is leading by committing to legislate the end of all federal [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=126.24s)]
*  barriers to inter-provincial trade by July 1. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=131.92s)]
*  Together we will push to create one Canadian economy by Canada Day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=136.76s)]
*  Because we are stronger together. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  This past week, we acted to protect workers using the proceeds of our retaliatory tariffs [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=147.6s)]
*  against America's unjustified trade actions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=152.84s)]
*  We acted to unlock major infrastructure projects and get them moving rapidly, including clean [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=157.4s)]
*  and conventional energy, critical minerals and new trade corridors with reliable trading [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=162.56s)]
*  partners. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  We acted to create new supports for farmers and businesses during this trade war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=170.76s)]
*  We expanded dental care for millions of more Canadians. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  And we took all of these actions and more to create the foundation to build a stronger [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=180.84s)]
*  Canada. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=187.56s)]
*  There is so much more to do to secure Canada. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=189.28s)]
*  To invest in Canada. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=193.12s)]
*  To build Canada. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=195.44s)]
*  To unite Canada. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=197.32s)]
*  That's why I'm asking for a strong, positive mandate from my fellow Canadians. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=200.04s)]
*  I have just requested that the Governor General dissolve Parliament and call an election for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=206.72s)]
*  April 28. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=213.52s)]
*  And she has agreed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=215.0s)]
*  We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=219.6s)]
*  unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=224.96s)]
*  Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=231.04s)]
*  President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=237.16s)]
*  He wants to break us so America can own us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=244.6s)]
*  We will not let that happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=251.36s)]
*  We're over the shock of the betrayal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=254.8s)]
*  We should never forget the lessons. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=258.16s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=261.76s)]
*  We have to look out for each other. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=265.04s)]
*  So incredibly strong words there from Mark Carney. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=273.24s)]
*  We're facing the most significant crisis in our lifetimes because of President Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=276.64s)]
*  Addressing directly the tariffs that President Trump has imposed on Canada and also this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=282.0s)]
*  concept that President Trump sees Canada as America's 51st state. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=287.68s)]
*  Let's listen back in. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can take away. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=296.56s)]
*  And the best way we can deal with this crisis is to build our strength here at home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  And help people who will be hit hardest by these tariffs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=310.12s)]
*  That's the right thing to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=314.92s)]
*  That's the fair thing to do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=317.24s)]
*  That's the Canadian thing to do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=319.88s)]
*  That's what makes us strong. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=322.88s)]
*  As part of that strategy, today I'm proposing a middle-class tax cut to help all working [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=326.76s)]
*  Canadians get ahead. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=332.08s)]
*  We will cut the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=335.24s)]
*  For a middle-class tax cut that will benefit a two-income family by up to $825 a year. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=340.2s)]
*  So Mark Carney, they're announcing that he is calling the snap election in Canada for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=349.12s)]
*  the 28th of April. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=359.8s)]
*  He wants a strong mandate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=362.48s)]
*  A leader of the Liberal Party. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  He wants to increase the strength of that party. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=366.72s)]
*  I'm asking Canadians for a strong, positive mandate to deal with President Trump. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=376.88s)]
*  And to build a new Canadian economy that works for everyone. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  Because I know we need change. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=388.0s)]
*  Big change. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=390.88s)]
*  Positive change. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=393.2s)]
*  You see, my generation was fortunate. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=395.84s)]
*  For us, there were more opportunities and life was more affordable. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  You had to work hard, but you could get ahead. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=404.74s)]
*  That was the bargain. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=408.9s)]
*  But for the generations that have followed, they're working just as hard or even harder [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=412.28s)]
*  than we did. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=417.64s)]
*  But they're struggling to pay the rent, to put groceries on the table and to save for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=419.5s)]
*  their kids' educations. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=425.0s)]
*  So Mark Carney, they're calling that snap election and really not mincing his words, being very, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=436.38s)]
*  very critical about Donald Trump saying that he wants to break us, as in the Canadian country, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=442.38s)]
*  so that America can own us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=449.18s)]
*  He's saying that the country is facing the most significant crises in our lifetimes and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=452.5s)]
*  laying the blame for that at Donald Trump's feet. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  So 28th April is when Canadians go to the polls and Mark Carney will be hopeful that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=467.9s)]
*  his Liberal Party will get a stronger mandate. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=476.18s)]
*  Of course, the main opposition, the Conservative Party, will be hoping that they will pick [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=480.1s)]
*  up votes, but they were ahead somewhat in the polls when Justin Trudeau was the leader [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=485.34s)]
*  of the Liberal Party. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=490.7s)]
*  That is a big bounce in the polls for liberals since Mark Carney took over. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=492.74s)]
*  When you've never fixed anything. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=497.82s)]
*  It's easy to be negative about everything when you've never built anything, when you've [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=500.9s)]
*  never had to make a payroll. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=506.82s)]
*  But negative slogans aren't solutions. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=511.06s)]
*  Anger is in action. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=516.1s)]
*  Division is in strength. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=518.1s)]
*  Negativity won't win a trade war. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=520.86s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=525.34s)]
*  Negativity won't bring down the price of groceries. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=528.8s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=532.5999999999999s)]
*  We have seen where negativity and division have led the United States. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  We are stronger when we are united. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  They are going to weaken because they are no longer. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=550.5999999999999s)]
*  So, we are united in this period of crisis. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=557.6s)]
*  I love Canada. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=565.6s)]
*  Our country has given me everything. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=567.76s)]
*  I stood up in Edmonton two months ago and I'm standing here today because I want to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=572.0s)]
*  give it all back to Canada. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=577.52s)]
*  So that every Canadian kid, whether they're growing up in Nanaimo or Montreal or St. John [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  or Scarborough or Inuvik has the same opportunities that I had, the same hope, the same confidence [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=587.28s)]
*  in a brighter future. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  It's time for all of us to come together and be strong. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=599.28s)]
*  So I'm asking for your vote so we can be Canada strong. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=604.8s)]
*  Canada for all. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=611.8s)]
*  Vive le Canada. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  And with that, I'll be pleased to take your questions. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Prime Minister. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  We'll begin our question period. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  We'll take 15 minutes of question. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=622.4399999999999s)]
*  One question, one follow-up. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Merci. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  On our question. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  Tanda McCharles with the Toronto Star. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  Sir, why are you throwing the country into an election in the middle of a tariff war? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  And if you think it's so necessary now, then why not make it longer so Canadians can really [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  see if you represent the change you claim to represent? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=644.08s)]
*  Well, a couple of things, Tanda. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=647.08s)]
*  First, is that we have put in place a tremendous amount of change in the nine days that I have [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=649.08s)]
*  been Prime Minister. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=656.08s)]
*  That includes changes to taxes, including the announcement today of a middle class tax [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=657.08s)]
*  cut. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=663.08s)]
*  But very importantly, we put in place protections for workers. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=664.08s)]
*  So we made a commitment right from the start that we would use all revenues from retaliatory [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=668.72s)]
*  tariffs to protect our workers. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=675.72s)]
*  And we put in place changes to the EI system in order to do that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=677.72s)]
*  I note that Mr. Poliev has taken that money and said he will use it for a tax cut and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=681.72s)]
*  care about workers being in place. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=687.72s)]
*  We put in place protections for businesses through this period. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=689.72s)]
*  We have shown the scale of our ambition in terms of creating what Canadians have asked [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=694.36s)]
*  for. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=700.36s)]
*  And I've heard this time and time again across this great country. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=701.36s)]
*  Canadians want one Canadian economy, not 13. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=704.36s)]
*  They want us to break down those barriers. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=707.36s)]
*  So we brought together the First Ministers, the Premiers of the provinces. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=709.36s)]
*  We hammered out a consensus about achieving that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=713.36s)]
*  We're picking up on the model that Nova Scotia and others have put in place. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=716.36s)]
*  We're making a commitment at the federal level to legislate the removal of all these [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=722.0s)]
*  barriers by Canada Day so we can have free trade by Canada Day. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=726.0s)]
*  So we've done a lot, I could go on, but we've done a lot in the nine days to put in place [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=729.0s)]
*  many of the foundations. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=734.0s)]
*  But what's important is that the government has a mandate from the Canadian people to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=735.0s)]
*  finish the job, to finish the job of building that Canadian economy, to finish the job of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=742.0s)]
*  diversifying our trading partners, and to have a strong mandate to stand up to Donald [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=747.64s)]
*  Trump and the Americans and negotiate the best deal for Canadians. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=753.2s)]
*  And that's what I will do. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=758.2s)]
*  After that meeting Friday night, you said you linked Pierre Poliev's conservatives to [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=761.2s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump's approach to cutting taxes, regulations, foreign aid. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=766.7s)]
*  Mr. Poliev's just staked out his own platform pitch to Canadians right now, today saying [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  that he will stand up to Trump, that a liberal is still just a liberal. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  So on what basis can you fairly compare the Canadian conservatives to Trump-style Republican [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  conservatives? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, first, the comparisons are quite easy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  You look at the language, the language mirrors, and the track record of language stretches [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=791.1s)]
*  back over years. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=796.08s)]
*  It's not a recent phenomenon, so straight from the language number one. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=797.08s)]
*  Secondly, from the intention. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  So Elon Musk stands up and says, and the Trump administration eliminates foreign aid. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=803.88s)]
*  Within a few days, Pierre Poliev flies in and out of Nunavut and says, I'm going to eliminate [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=809.5799999999999s)]
*  foreign aid. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=816.9399999999999s)]
*  By the way, he doesn't talk to the premier, he doesn't talk to local indigenous leaders [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  while he's there. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=822.16s)]
*  Not our approach, obviously. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  So a series of words plus proposals which are uncannily familiar with the proposals [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=827.66s)]
*  of the Trump administration, very different from our approach, very different from our [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=836.42s)]
*  approach, for example, to building a housing market, both offering much greater supply, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=840.9s)]
*  very different from our approach. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=850.24s)]
*  I'll give you one last example because I know there's a long lineup of questions. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=851.3399999999999s)]
*  Today, we announced that we are going to expand dental care. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=856.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, the dental care program that was put in place several months ago now serves 1.8 [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=860.78s)]
*  million Canadians. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=866.86s)]
*  1.8 million Canadians have received dental care under this program. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=867.86s)]
*  These are people who could not afford dental care previously. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=872.9s)]
*  Pierre Poliev pretends they don't exist. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=876.38s)]
*  We've just expanded the potential pool by another 4.5 million Canadians who also are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=879.94s)]
*  in that situation. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=885.38s)]
*  That is a very different approach to Canada. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=886.58s)]
*  That's a Canada that brings Canadians together, protects all, and that's the Canada we're [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=889.54s)]
*  offering. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=893.66s)]
*  Good afternoon, Prime Minister Ashley Burke, CBC News. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=894.66s)]
*  You've repealed the capital gains tax changes and you're promising this middle-class tax [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=898.38s)]
*  cut, but you're also making new spending commitments. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=902.88s)]
*  So how do you plan to pay for that and what kind of cuts will you have to make to keep [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=905.74s)]
*  up with your promise of a deficit below 1% of GDP? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=910.28s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=914.34s)]
*  One is that we are looking at driving efficiency in government, in other words, productivity [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=916.02s)]
*  in government by flipping around the approach to government, which is to concentrate on [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=922.34s)]
*  the outcomes. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=927.02s)]
*  So as Mark Carney there going into quite domestic policies and what he wants to do, and no doubt [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=928.02s)]
*  we'll get much, much more details as Canada goes into full campaign mode ahead of, during [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=935.7s)]
*  that election campaign. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=941.42s)]
*  We now know that the election date, the snap election date is the 28th of April. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=942.64s)]
*  We have a number of guests just to dissect this a little bit further. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=948.9799999999999s)]
*  I'm very pleased to say we are joined by Mark Carcassol, who's a correspondent for the Canadian [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=951.78s)]
*  Broadcasting Corporation. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=958.62s)]
*  Mark from CBC, welcome to the BBC. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=960.42s)]
*  Lovely to speak to you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=963.66s)]
*  Just in terms of what we're seeing today, arguably it's not such a surprise that Mark [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=965.3399999999999s)]
*  Carney is calling this snap election. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=971.3399999999999s)]
*  He will have his work cut out though in making Canadians get to know him. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=974.9s)]
*  He certainly will. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=980.42s)]
*  And yeah, this is no surprise. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=981.42s)]
*  In fact, we've joked around here in the newsroom at CBC that this is essentially the worst [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=982.42s)]
*  kept secret in Canadian politics at this point. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=986.0999999999999s)]
*  Everyone kind of knew it was happening this weekend and everyone knew that an election [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=988.7399999999999s)]
*  was coming in the springtime. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=991.54s)]
*  But he definitely will have his work cut out for him. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=993.8s)]
*  There are several aggregated public opinion polls that have been done by pollsters across [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=995.8s)]
*  this country who have shown that in a matter of mere weeks to months, the Liberal Party [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1001.24s)]
*  under Mark Carney, their new leader, has pulled ahead of Pierre Paul Yev in the Conservative [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1007.12s)]
*  Party, which at one point had a strong, strong lead in these polls, certainly. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  But five weeks in politics is an eternity. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1016.4799999999999s)]
*  And a lot can change in five weeks, as it did to get us to this point. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1022.0s)]
*  So certainly you can tell by the things that he did in his nine days as prime minister [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1025.0s)]
*  and the things that he's promising to do if he gets elected prime minister again on April [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1032.0s)]
*  28th, that Mark Carney knows, as you mentioned, Tasha, he certainly has his work cut out for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1037.0s)]
*  him. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1041.4s)]
*  He has a lot to do. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1042.4s)]
*  There are a lot of people who, while they may like the Liberal Party, do not necessarily [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1043.4s)]
*  trust Mark Carney because he is a prime minister who was not a sitting member of parliament [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1048.04s)]
*  to begin with. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1053.44s)]
*  He found what many seem to feel was a loophole in getting into the Liberal leadership race [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1054.52s)]
*  and becoming prime minister that way. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1060.26s)]
*  So he has to prove that he is prime minister worthy. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1061.76s)]
*  He has to prove that essentially that he can do this the right way. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1064.44s)]
*  And as he has mentioned several times, and this has sort of become the main plank for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1067.52s)]
*  all the parties now in our upcoming election, he has to prove that he can stand up to Donald [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1073.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1077.44s)]
*  Canadians are a little bit frightened. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1078.44s)]
*  They're worried. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1079.68s)]
*  There are these incoming tariffs at the start of April. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1080.68s)]
*  There are open threats to our sovereignty coming from the U.S. president. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1084.04s)]
*  So people are very concerned and they feel as though many Canadians feel as though we're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  currently on a rudderless ship. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1093.72s)]
*  We have a prime minister who stepped down. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1094.94s)]
*  Our parliament was already prorogued, has been prorogued since the start of the new [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1097.28s)]
*  year and no one really knows where we go from here. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1100.16s)]
*  So the country wants strong leadership. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  Mark, on that point that he wasn't elected, I did actually and we will bring Professor [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1105.6799999999998s)]
*  Lander in who has been with us throughout all of this press conference by Mark Carney. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
*  But Mark, just that idea that he wasn't elected, Professor Lander corrected me in saying that, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1114.6799999999998s)]
*  well, he actually did go through a sort of an election for the leadership. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  So he's been through a little bit of the politics and personally has a mandate by being elected [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1124.84s)]
*  as the leader of the Liberal Party. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  But you still feel that there's still a little bit of ambiguity as to whether that was the [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1134.24s)]
*  right way to do it? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1139.64s)]
*  It's certainly not illegal in any way. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1142.44s)]
*  But the thing is, is that yes, he was elected by members of the Liberal Party. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1145.68s)]
*  However, that is not a poll of the wider Canadian public. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1149.36s)]
*  That is a poll specifically of members of the Liberal Party, card carrying, membership [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1152.76s)]
*  paying members of the Liberal Party. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1158.72s)]
*  They elected their leader. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1161.9199999999998s)]
*  And yes, in Canada, we do not elect prime ministers. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1162.9199999999998s)]
*  We vote for our individual MPs. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1166.36s)]
*  Our system is essentially modeled after your Westminster system, Tasha. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1170.06s)]
*  But because he has not been elected prime minister by the wider Canadian public, there [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1174.94s)]
*  is a lot of people who just feel a little bit iffy about him and are not quite sure. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1179.52s)]
*  And I think many people will be grateful for the opportunity to have a full, wide federal [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1189.24s)]
*  It's not something that people necessarily look forward to most times, most years. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1190.32s)]
*  But I think this time around, people will very much look forward to having that wide, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1194.24s)]
*  for lack of a better term, public opinion poll here. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1199.92s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1202.56s)]
*  So, Mark, you're going to be busy during that election time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1203.56s)]
*  Mark Harkosol during the campaigning, a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1206.64s)]
*  CBC. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1211.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1212.44s)]
*  So let's bring in our previous guest, Professor Moshe Landa, senior economist at Concordia [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1213.44s)]
*  University in Montreal. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1218.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for staying with us. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1219.92s)]
*  As we watch Mark Carney coming out there, he was really strong, wasn't he? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  He was saying Canada's facing the most significant crisis of our lifetime. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1226.76s)]
*  He said that America wants to break Canada's so that they can own us. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1231.52s)]
*  Are you surprised by the strength of his words? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1235.16s)]
*  No, he's had nine days to write that speech. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1237.5600000000002s)]
*  So he's going to have to come out of the box. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1240.8000000000002s)]
*  As Mark was just saying before he brought me back in, he hasn't faced the Canadian public [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1243.28s)]
*  yet in an elected office. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1247.8s)]
*  So if this is going to be the first time that Canadians are hearing him speak beyond just [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1249.92s)]
*  his role as the previous governor of the Bank of Canada, then you can't come out and mince [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1254.04s)]
*  words. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1257.68s)]
*  You can't say, let's hope that somewhere over the next five weeks we figure out what it [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1258.68s)]
*  is that we want to do. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1261.76s)]
*  Here's our plan. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1263.2s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1264.2s)]
*  Here's the threat we see and here's how we're going to address it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1265.2s)]
*  I think he did a very good job. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1267.4s)]
*  His French was a little iffy, but I think that's forgivable. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1268.68s)]
*  I have to say our producer is French and he was, yes, raised a little bit of eyebrow [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1271.92s)]
*  on terms of the pronunciation. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1276.44s)]
*  But of course, we know that Canada is a bilingual nation. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1277.96s)]
*  Just just in terms of the how he was perceived in Canada as the head of the Bank of Canada, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1281.4s)]
*  the central bank of the country, was he popular? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1289.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't know the Bank of Canada governors have any sort of popularity or [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1293.4s)]
*  curating. I often ask my students, does anybody know who the current Bank of Canada governor [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1297.3200000000002s)]
*  is? And I get blank looks and sometimes I even have to remind myself what the current governor [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1302.52s)]
*  looks like when I see him on TV. I'm like, oh, right, that's him. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1306.12s)]
*  It's an extremely powerful position. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1309.0s)]
*  It's independent of the government. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1311.2399999999998s)]
*  They have a mandate to keep inflation between one and three percent. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1312.76s)]
*  Other than a couple of years after COVID, they've been extremely successful going back [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1315.4799999999998s)]
*  to the early 1990s. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1318.76s)]
*  But the fact is that they're unelected and other than appearing every six or seven weeks [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1320.76s)]
*  to give a speech about what they're going to do with interest rates, they're mostly [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1324.36s)]
*  touring among the business leaders of Canada and giving speeches there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1327.7199999999998s)]
*  But it doesn't really resonate with the Canadian public. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1331.2399999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure that anybody's going to really remember him other than just, yeah, I seem [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1333.48s)]
*  to recall he did a good job. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1336.8400000000001s)]
*  He needs to effectively reintroduce himself, especially in this kind of political framework [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1338.68s)]
*  in his role as the leader of the Liberal Party. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1343.8000000000002s)]
*  Just technically then, what happens? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1347.16s)]
*  We heard there from our correspondent, our colleague at CBS, CBC, rather, describing [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1348.6000000000001s)]
*  that your system, the Canadian system echoes, mirrors the UK system. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1353.5600000000002s)]
*  Of course, the King Charles is the head of state in Canada. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1358.2800000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1363.48s)]
*  So we have about 340 some odd writings similar to what you would have in the UK, just not [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1364.0400000000002s)]
*  as many because we don't have as many people. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1368.76s)]
*  Everybody is going to vote for who they want to be their member of parliament. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1370.6000000000001s)]
*  And so the Liberals, the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, which would kind [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1373.64s)]
*  of be similar to your Lib Dems, a little bit left of centre, but maybe not with the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1377.5600000000002s)]
*  pro-marketry that has its history. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1381.88s)]
*  It's maybe a little more of our Socialist Party are going to have representatives in [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1384.44s)]
*  every writing. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1388.44s)]
*  There's a separatist movement in Quebec that's probably going to offer up some candidates [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1389.72s)]
*  as well. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's whoever the leader is of the largest party is going to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1394.6s)]
*  be asked by the governor general, the King's representative, to form a government. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1398.52s)]
*  And so it's very, very similar. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1401.72s)]
*  And unlike the US system, we're not directly voting for Mark Carney. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1403.8s)]
*  But it is true that similar to the UK, I think in a lot of cases, the personality of the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  leader tends to reflect into the local politics. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1412.6s)]
*  And so even though you're supposed to be voting for who you want to represent, it's hard to [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1416.6s)]
*  ignore the fact that we have three leaders essentially to choose from. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1421.56s)]
*  And that's going to strongly influence, I think, the way the vote goes as well. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1424.52s)]
*  And so just briefly, if you would, just when it comes to the main opposition candidates, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1427.4s)]
*  how do they test themselves and how do they look like when it comes to Mark Carney? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1434.92s)]
*  Because we know that we already said he's a smooth talking, he's confident. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1440.12s)]
*  What about the other two? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1443.08s)]
*  So the leader of the NDP party is Jagmeet Singh. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1444.92s)]
*  He has been leader for some years now. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1447.64s)]
*  I don't know that he's a credible prime minister. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1450.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just very difficult to be able to form a government that far to the left in Canadian [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1452.28s)]
*  politics. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1456.8400000000001s)]
*  The Liberals are going to be the centrist group of the bunch. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1457.48s)]
*  Pierre Poilieff is the leader of the Conservative Party. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1459.88s)]
*  He's been there for some time now. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1462.6000000000001s)]
*  He's a former minister in the previous Conservative government. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1464.1200000000001s)]
*  He will certainly appeal to the base in the Canadian Prairie provinces, which tend to [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1467.56s)]
*  lean a little more right. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1471.56s)]
*  He's going to have to work really hard to win over the major centres in Toronto, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1472.84s)]
*  Montreal and Vancouver. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1476.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think whoever is going to form the next government really needs to win a lot of those [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1478.36s)]
*  writings to make the numbers add up. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1482.36s)]
*  I don't know that any of them have necessarily the power to create a majority government. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1484.84s)]
*  So we could be facing another minority government here where you're being propped up. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1488.52s)]
*  Moshi, thanks for being with us on BBC News. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsi4LzvHhk&t=1491.6399999999999s)]
