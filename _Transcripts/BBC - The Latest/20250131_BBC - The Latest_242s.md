# Families displaced by the war in Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0)
*  To Ukraine now, and it's nearly three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=0.0s)]
*  country. And as attention turns to what a possible end to the conflict could look like, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=4.76s)]
*  for many displaced families the search for their loved ones continues. Our Eastern Europe [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=9.8s)]
*  correspondent Sarah Rainsford has been to meet one woman whose parents are amongst an [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=14.16s)]
*  estimated 60,000 missing soldiers and civilians who've disappeared following the occupation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=18.6s)]
*  of a vast area of the east of the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=24.5s)]
*  From occupied southeastern Ukraine, a message of reassurance and love. From parents to a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=30.0s)]
*  daughter separated by Russia's invasion of their country. Lyudmila shows me her phone [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=40.0s)]
*  full of memories of a couple full of energy and life. In September 2023, Oleg and Tatyana [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=47.0s)]
*  were detained by the Russians and disappeared. For four months Lyudmila had no information [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=57.0s)]
*  at all. Then Russian soldiers dumped her mother at a hospital in a coma. She died without [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=65.0s)]
*  ever coming round. It's just so tough to think what they did to her and why. My mum was 51, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=72.0s)]
*  she loved life, then everything was cut short. She was such a radiant person, for me she's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=86.0s)]
*  still alive. Her father Oleg has still not been found. If God forbid something happens [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=94.0s)]
*  to my dad, it will kill me. When the Russian army took over Lyudmila's town, many Ukrainians [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=104.0s)]
*  there protested. But gradually the resistance in Melotopol was crushed as the Russians began [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=114.0s)]
*  rounding up those suspected of siding with Kiev. Lyudmila now knows her mother was charged [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=121.0s)]
*  with espionage. But despite all these official papers from the Russian side, she's no closer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=131.0s)]
*  to knowing where Tatyana was held, how she came to die or what has happened to her father. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=137.0s)]
*  Ukraine's police force is trying to find Oleg and all this country's missing civilians. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=144.0s)]
*  This officer didn't want to be identified but he did show me how they work. The police [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=150.0s)]
*  officer here is just explaining how they use facial recognition software to try to find [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=157.0s)]
*  some of the missing. They have Lyudmila's father's photograph on their database and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=162.0s)]
*  they've been looking for him, thinking perhaps the pro-Russian or the Russian authorities [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=166.0s)]
*  might post something online and that might be one way of finding him. But there's been [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=171.0s)]
*  no trace at all of Oleg. Sometimes the missing do turn up. Lenid was also detained by the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=175.0s)]
*  Russians in Melotopol. Three months later he showed up in hospital, his body, evidence [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=184.0s)]
*  of what he'd been through. His family, now abroad, tell me Lenid then vanished again [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=191.0s)]
*  for a whole year. He's now facing trial in Russia, accused of taking photographs of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=198.0s)]
*  military that had occupied his town. He'd been in the most terrible conditions. He said, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=205.0s)]
*  Mom, in the word, I was in hell. He said, when I was a kid you used to talk about heaven [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=213.0s)]
*  and hell. I was in hell. It is stories like Lenid's, however tough, that give Lyudmila [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=221.0s)]
*  hope. That her father too is somewhere in a basement or a Russian prison cell and still [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=230.0s)]
*  waiting to be found. Sarah Rainswood, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSncrtsVND0&t=237.0s)]
