Video Description: Bereaved families are calling on the UKâ€™s online regulator to shut down a "vile" website which promotes videos of the deaths of their loved ones.
 
The website, which we are not naming, has more than three million members and contains thousands of graphic photos and videos of real-life killings and suicides as well as executions carried out by extremists.
 
From Monday, Ofcom gets new powers to crack down on illegal content, but it may not be enough to close the site.
 
The site's admin team have said they would give their "full attention" to any Ofcom requests.

# Bereaved families call for 'death website' to be shut down | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us)
*  Now, bereaved families in the UK want the communications watchdog Ofcom to take action [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=0.0s)]
*  against a website which hosts videos showing the deaths of their loved ones. The site promotes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=5.88s)]
*  graphic images of murders, suicides and terrorist executions. The family's call comes on the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=11.4s)]
*  day Ofcom gets the power to investigate and find platforms that host illegal material. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=17.72s)]
*  Here's our correspondent, Angus Crawford. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=24.32s)]
*  Shootings, stabbings, decapitation, execution. Imagine a site showing the very worst of humanity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=27.8s)]
*  And it exists right here. The videos are horrifying, far too graphic to show you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=36.84s)]
*  But it's not hidden on the dark web. This site is easy to find and it's got more than three [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=42.76s)]
*  million members. One of those videos is of David Haynes, brutally murdered by ISIS. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  This is his brother, Mike. It's horrifying, horrifying. David's execution, uncensored, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=55.48s)]
*  is easy to find on the site. People that host these websites are absolute scum. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=62.76s)]
*  Some videos get hundreds of thousands of views. Parents and mental health experts are worried [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=74.6s)]
*  about the ramifications of a gruesome video circulating. The death of Ronnie McNutt, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=80.28s)]
*  who ended his life on a live stream, one of the most popular, horrifying his friends. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=85.24s)]
*  It made me angry that people were doing this. It made me angry that people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=91.72s)]
*  were using these images of my friend on his worst day. Panic and the sound of gunshots. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=95.56s)]
*  Upsetting for family and friends of the dead, but what about the impact on young users? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=101.32s)]
*  The shooter was 17 years old. We know a teenage school shooter in Tennessee in January was a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=106.6s)]
*  member of the site. We also know that the Southport killer, Axel Ruda-Cubana, searched for this kind of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  content. Another user was Luton teenager Nicholas Prosper, who killed his mother and two siblings. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  He was arrested on his way to attack his old school. There's just so much content. Those who [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=128.76s)]
*  study online radicalisation say it's dangerous. The idea that you could watch that online and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=135.56s)]
*  watch that multiple times will over time desensitise you to that type of content. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  The worry is then that engaging in extreme violence, so we've seen a lot of mass shootings [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=146.36s)]
*  in the US, what might have seemed like an impossible solution to how someone might be feeling [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=151.88s)]
*  would then become something that feels like a viable option. From today, the full powers of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=158.6s)]
*  the online safety act come into force. Ofcom can finally take action, but will it? The administrators [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=164.44s)]
*  of the website told us, we routinely receive reports from many government agencies and industry [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=171.8s)]
*  watchdogs. Any reports they send will have our full attention. Every second that we delay in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=177.96s)]
*  shutting this site down, we are endangering our use. That kind of content, no one needs access to. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=185.56s)]
*  I want to make sure that that website doesn't function, specifically because of my friend. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-3GObY_Us&t=194.76s)]
