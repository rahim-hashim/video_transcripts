*  Turkey braced for record temperatures. Much of the Mediterranean remains in the grip of a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=44.8s)]
*  fierce heat wave. Last week's was named Cerberus after the mythological three-headed dog that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=50.879999999999995s)]

*  after the ferryman who transported souls there. In Venice, the tourists have still come, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=62.88s)]
*  but are enduring almost unbearable temperatures. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=68.72s)]
*  The heat is really harmful for us because the temperature in the gondola reaches 50 degrees. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=75.6s)]
*  We've already tried to measure it. In fact, I'm one of the few who use the cover so as not to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=80.64s)]
*  feel the heat from the gondola that goes up your legs, it goes through your feet. It really burns. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=85.68s)]
*  A shifting Gulf Stream is drawing hot air from North Africa into Europe, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=91.2s)]
*  and also causing near record temperatures across North America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Wildfires have been raging for months in parts of Canada, where more than 10 million hectares of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=101.2s)]
*  forest have been destroyed in just six months. The previous record was seven million in an entire [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=106.72s)]
*  year. While in the US, more than a third of the population are now living under extreme heat [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=114.0s)]
*  advisories. In Arizona, the temperature hit 43 degrees Celsius for the sixth day running, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=120.56s)]
*  nearing a record. It's currently not predicted to go below that point for weeks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=127.2s)]
*  And it's not only affecting the land. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=132.96s)]
*  Water temperatures in the ocean around Florida are off the charts. They're in the 90s, very warm, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=135.6s)]
*  and it's not only in Florida. Something like 40 percent of the planet is seeing a marine heat [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=141.04s)]
*  wave right now. That's very serious for the animals that live in the ocean. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, south of the border in Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, temperatures are topping 40 degrees. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=152.48s)]
*  The heat is strong. If you walk three blocks, you get exhausted. It heats you up, and you get too [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=162.32s)]
*  much sun. It has been hotter than other times. Man-made climate change is widely accepted to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=168.32s)]
*  be behind events that are only going to get more frequent. Having a heat wave in the summer isn't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=176.32s)]
*  unheard of, but what's really becoming unusual is the collection of these events, so the frequency [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=182.56s)]
*  and also the simultaneous occurrence around the globe. So, unfortunately, this is not surprising [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=188.24s)]
*  what we're seeing. It's exactly what we expect from shifting the baseline temperature towards [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=194.56s)]
*  a higher level and therefore shifting the odds towards more extreme heat events. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=199.28s)]
*  In the coming days, Sardinia could hit 48 Celsius, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=206.8s)]
*  just shy of the hottest ever temperature recorded in Europe. That was set in Sicily last year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=210.8s)]
*  The way things are going, it is a record that will not last for long. Joe Inwood, BBC News. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e95Baixs0MY&t=217.68s)]
