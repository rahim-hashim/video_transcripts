# Why isn't Glastonbury Festival happening in 2026? #GlastonburyFestival #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg)
*  If you didn't get to Glastonbury this year, you're going to have to wait till 2027 to get here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=0.0s)]
*  But why? Every five years, organisers choose to have a fallow year to give the land a rest. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=4.48s)]
*  They say it's to avoid causing irreparable damage to the working pastures of the farm. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=9.52s)]
*  The last time the festival had an official fallow year was in 2018, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=13.52s)]
*  and in 2020 and in 2021 it was cancelled due to the pandemic. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=17.04s)]
*  Co-organiser Emily Evers said living in harmony in the land is vital for the festival, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=20.8s)]
*  and so is giving everyone a little time to switch off. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=25.2s)]
*  Break also gives people in the nearby village of Pilton a chance for a breather as well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=27.84s)]
*  Now an army of staff and volunteers are already hard at work turning the site back into a working [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=31.92s)]
*  farm. But it is a big task with over 140,000 people on site for the weekend. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=36.96s)]
*  And anyone heading home expect big queues and delays on the journey back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VcOBQT4cWg&t=42.08s)]
