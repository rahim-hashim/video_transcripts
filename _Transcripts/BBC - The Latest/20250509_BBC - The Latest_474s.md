The Pope was joined by cardinals for prayers, the morning after his identity was revealed to the world.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI)
*  We're going to head straight to the Vatican. My colleague Marion Mishiri is standing by Marion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Lewis, thank you very much indeed. Yes, welcome to the Vatican where Pope Leo XIV has been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=8.24s)]
*  celebrating Mass with Cardinals at the Sistine Chapel following his election on Thursday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=14.72s)]
*  These are the recent pictures of the new Pope entering the Sistine Chapel leading his first [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=20.08s)]
*  Mass as Pontiff. He began his homily in English saying he knew he could rely on every Cardinal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=30.4s)]
*  to walk with him on his new mission. The Pope has said the Church must do more work in places [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=36.32s)]
*  where there is a lack of faith and said that he hopes his election can help the Catholic [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=41.36s)]
*  Church bring light to the dark nights of this world. Well, Pope Leo will be the 267th occupant [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=45.92s)]
*  of the throne of Saint Peter, so what do we know about the first American to fill the role of Pope? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, 69-year-old Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago to parents of Spanish [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=59.52s)]
*  and Franco-Italian descent. He was ordained in 1982 and moved to Peru three years later. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=66.88s)]
*  He then became a naturalised Peruvian citizen spending 10 years as a local parish pastor [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=73.76s)]
*  and teaching at a seminary in northwestern Peru. He became well known to Cardinals in the Vatican [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=79.68s)]
*  because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for bishops. Pope Francis made him [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=85.36s)]
*  the Bishop of Chicleo in Peru in 2014 and then he became Archbishop in January 2023. Within a few [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=91.2s)]
*  months Pope Francis had made him a Cardinal. Well, joining me here is Anna Rowlands, Professor [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=98.88s)]
*  of Catholic Social Thought and Practice at Durham University who's been on succumbment to the Vatican [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  for two years and I have to say you met the new Pope last night. What was that like? I did, which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  was a surprise and an accident. How was it an accident? How does one meet the Pope accidentally? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=115.6s)]
*  Well, my colleague who's a very senior woman in the Vatican, one of the most senior women in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=120.32s)]
*  Vatican to be appointed by Pope Francis was charging at high speed across Saint Peter's Square [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=124.16s)]
*  and I bumped into her and she said to me, run! And I said, why? And she said, just run! So at that point [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=128.56s)]
*  I realised I was following her back to the Palazzo that's just behind where we're talking now [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=133.84s)]
*  and that's where she lives in one of the apartments and where the former Cardinal Prevost lived as [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=138.24s)]
*  well. So rather sweetly, just as Pope Francis had gone back to pay his bill at the guest house just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=143.44s)]
*  after he became Pope, Pope Leo XIV went back to the community in the Palazzo where he lives to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=148.4s)]
*  greet people personally, to give them a blessing and to spend a little time talking. There you are! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=154.64s)]
*  That's Sister Natalie as well. There you are speaking to him and what did he say to you? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=161.2s)]
*  So well, I had a chance to congratulate him and also to assure him of prayers but also to thank [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=164.48s)]
*  him in particular for the powerful words that he spoke from the balcony and to express the gratitude [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=170.16s)]
*  on behalf of the crowd. So many of that crowd would have loved to have had the chance I had last night [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=175.6s)]
*  to greet him personally so I felt responsible to bring him the gratitude and the joy of that crowd. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  What were the powerful words that stuck out for you from last night? So peace, nine times he mentioned [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=184.64s)]
*  the word peace and he wants to be a peace builder, a bridge builder he said both for the church, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=190.64s)]
*  whether a divisions in the church but also for the world. The second key message was love, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=196.0s)]
*  the completely unconditional love of God for all people and he talked about bringing peace and love [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  for the whole of humanity but also for the whole earth. So that message very much from Benedict [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=207.04s)]
*  and Francis that's focused on our climactic situation as well as our kind of human situation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=212.8s)]
*  of brokenness. So I think he wants to focus on peace building, on a kind of unifying project, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  overcoming polarization and to be basically a pope of a just peace for our times. Powerful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=224.72s)]
*  Will he succeed given the geopolitical headwinds, given the way in which the Catholic Church has [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=231.28s)]
*  been moving over the last few years? Yes, I think that there's a very good chance he will. He came [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=236.4s)]
*  out dressed like Benedict speaking like Francis. That was the first sign of I think his unifying [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=240.4s)]
*  mission to thread together literally in the threads he was wearing to thread together these [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=246.72s)]
*  papacies and I think that for the church is very significant as a sign for the world, also an [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=251.52s)]
*  important sign. His first visit as I understand it outside the Vatican will be to the Regina Chaley [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=256.8s)]
*  prison just down the road from here. Interesting. Yeah he's an Augustinian so he brings that focus [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  on intellectual life but also service of the poorest and the most marginalized. That is a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=266.48s)]
*  heady literally combination and I think very interesting to have an Augustinian pope for a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  moment when as we saw the other month JD Vance quoting Saint Augustine on Christian nationalism. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=276.8s)]
*  What will an Augustinian pope say to an Augustinian moment? Well what indeed. Anna it's a pleasure to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=282.8s)]
*  talk to you. Thank you very much for sharing your photos as well. Not at all. You and Pope Leo the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  14th. Now let me just if I may show viewers at home some of the Italian newspapers from this [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=291.68s)]
*  morning and unsurprisingly all of them showing the new pope on the front page. This is Il Giornale, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=298.08s)]
*  Leone d'America, the Lion of America, a play on the pope's name. La pace sia con te. I don't know [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=305.04s)]
*  if you can see that from the Avenida publication. Peace be with us. Sorry con noi. La pace sia con [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  noi. Peace be with us. And here we have La Stampa, Il Papa dei due mondi, the pope of two worlds. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=320.08s)]
*  And I think a reference there to the fact that Pope Leo is American born, North American born, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=330.56s)]
*  but also a naturalized Peruvian citizen. So also has strong connections with Latin America. And [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=336.88s)]
*  finally La Repubblica, Il Papa Americano, the American pope. Absolutely brilliant front pages [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=342.4s)]
*  there. All of them showing Pope Leo the 14th on that balcony. Well, Louis Prevost is the brother [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=349.44s)]
*  of Pope Leo. He's spoken about the moment he found out his sibling was the new head of the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=355.76s)]
*  Roman Catholic Church. Have a listen. It was like, oh my God, it's Rob. It's never going to be the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=361.04s)]
*  same. What are we going to do? Yes, it's Rob. Yeah. I used to, I still do it, you know, play with guns, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=368.64s)]
*  knives, bows and arrows. He would play priest. How boring. Come on, Rob, let's go. No, can I give you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=378.56s)]
*  communion? And we just teach him, you're going to be the pope. You want to be the pope. Here we are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=385.92s)]
*  today. He knew from an early stage he wanted to be a priest. And he did. Got out of grammar school, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  went right to the seminary. He was always like a servant to the people, trying to help the people [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=400.64s)]
*  build churches down there and schools. He's more down the middle. Okay, let's see how we can take [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=407.68s)]
*  what Francis did, massage it a little bit. As pope now, he's just reinforcing the fact that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=415.92s)]
*  God and Jesus said, follow me and you'll be saved. Evil will not win. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=424.8s)]
*  That's the brother of Pope Leo XIV. And the mood, the atmosphere here in the Vatican is one of such [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  hope. I spoke to a few people as I was walking into work this morning and they asked me if I was a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=440.64s)]
*  journalist. I said, yes, I am. And they said, are you happy about Pope Leo? And I said, yes, are you? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=445.76s)]
*  And they all unanimously said to me, yes, we are so happy. We're so excited. And that really is the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=451.12s)]
*  feeling that one gets from walking around within St Peter's Basilica and the area around the Vatican. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=457.6s)]
*  There is such a feeling of hope, of renewal, of a look towards the future for the Roman Catholic Church. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv3fkRIsNI&t=464.96000000000004s)]
