Video Description: The US Supreme Court has issued a 6-3 ruling that will curb judges' power to block President Donald Trump's orders nationwide.
 
The case stems from President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants
Trump calls the decision a "giant win" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said it will stop the "endless barrage" of injunctions against the president's agenda.
This ruling did not directly tackle the constitutionality of Trump's order, a case likely to end up before the top court at a later date

# President Trump hails 'giant win' after Supreme Court curbs judges' power to block orders | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo)
*  We begin in the US where in the last hour the Supreme Court has issued a ruling with consequences for the Trump administration's plans to limit birthright citizenship. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=0.0s)]
*  The Court has ruled with a 6-3 majority that the power of federal judges to place on hold government decisions should be limited. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=10.5s)]
*  That's a ruling on the legal process but not the specific birthright policy which may well get to the Supreme Court separately. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=19.5s)]
*  But in practical terms it does leave birthright citizenship long assumed to exist in the United States in doubt now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=27.5s)]
*  Well our North America correspondent Nomi Iqbal explained to me the significance of what we've heard from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=35.0s)]
*  It's a big win for President Trump no doubt. There are some technicalities just to get through if you can bear with me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=42.0s)]
*  So the actual opinion is more than 100 pages about 119. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=49.0s)]
*  And just to remind our audience on the first day back in office President Trump signed an executive order. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=55.0s)]
*  And that order was aimed at ending automatic citizenship rights for nearly anyone born on US territory and that's commonly referred to as birthright citizenship. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=62.0s)]
*  Now it's in the Constitution which establishes the principle of birthright citizenship but Donald Trump doesn't agree with that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=71.0s)]
*  He wanted to limit that. When he issued that executive order there were instant lawsuits from judges in district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=78.5s)]
*  Basically issuing nationwide injunctions that blocked that order from taking effect. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=87.5s)]
*  They described it as blatantly unconstitutional. So Trump's Department of Justice challenged that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=93.5s)]
*  So here we are now. So whilst this is not about directly about birthright citizenship the question essentially was can a single judge block an executive order for the entire country? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=100.0s)]
*  And the Supreme Court is saying no they can't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=113.0s)]
*  And so what that is that is a win for President Trump in the sense that he loves to govern through executive orders but his executive orders are always blocked by lots of lower courts. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=117.0s)]
*  So essentially this will make it easier for him to push through his executive orders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=128.5s)]
*  Now what that means for birthright citizenship. So if you are someone here in the US on a visa or you are an illegal immigrant or an immigrant or what have you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=133.5s)]
*  and Donald Trump does not want your child to have birthright citizenship we don't know yet what that means. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=144.5s)]
*  It's pretty unclear at the moment and I mean the lower court could step back in they could issue a new injunction based on the state claims. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=150.0s)]
*  It's pretty complicated. But just to give you the comment by Justice Barrett who wrote the majority she says the executive order on birthright citizenship shall not take effect until 30 days after the date of this opinion. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=158.0s)]
*  So that delay in some ways gives time for another way to challenge the order. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=174.5s)]
*  So at the moment we are still sort of working through it and trying to understand what it all means but I suppose the headline is that this is a victory for President Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=179.5s)]
*  You were just taking us through Nomiya the implications for birthright citizenship but from my reading of what you just said there this extends to all those other sorts of areas [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=190.5s)]
*  and we see the the flurry the avalanche of executive orders from this president all of the time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=202.0s)]
*  So presumably does this cover all of those potential areas? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=206.0s)]
*  In theory yes I think I think it does because you know just to give you some background on this basically conservatives and liberal justices [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=212.0s)]
*  there's always been this sort of argument that one district should not be able to unilaterally decide policy for the entire country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=222.5s)]
*  I just want to comment just to give you a comment from Elena Kagan who is a liberal justice she said back in 2022 it can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=231.5s)]
*  and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process something that the conservative justice Clarence Thomas also agreed on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=244.0s)]
*  And the problem with injunctions also is that they enable what's known as sort of forum shopping so basically you file a lawsuit in a jurisdiction where there might be a more favourable ruling. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=253.0s)]
*  And the Trump administration's argument is that this is blocking our executive orders that he's been elected into office he loves to govern through executive order rather than going through Congress so he wants his policies to be implemented. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=266.5s)]
*  But those who back injunctions just to give you that side of it they say that it's needed because otherwise the power of the executive branch could go unchecked. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=279.5s)]
*  And for many who are critical of President Trump who are concerned by his agenda they see these injunctions as the only legal mechanism to prevent his agenda from being implemented. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=291.0s)]
*  Well that was Nomi Eqbal and Nomi talking about analysis of it being a big win for Donald Trump that's exactly what he has said he has just posted on Truth Social reacting to what the Supreme Court has decided saying it is a giant win. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=305.0s)]
*  In the United States he then goes on to say even the birthright citizenship hoax as he describes it has been indirectly hit hard it had to do with babies of slaves not the scamming he says of our immigration process and then congratulates the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOY4OOXPcjo&t=320.0s)]
