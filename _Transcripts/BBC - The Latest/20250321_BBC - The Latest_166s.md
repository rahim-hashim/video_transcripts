Video Description: Sudan's army has announced that its fighters have recaptured the presidential palace in the centre of Khartoum from the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
 
In recent weeks the army has stepped up its campaign in the city, which it lost at the start of the war in 2023.
 
Reclaiming Khartoum would be a huge victory for the army and a pivotal moment in the conflict. But the RSF still controls large parts of the country â€“ including much of the west.

The two-year civil war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN.

# Sudan army retakes presidential palace in Khartoum | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4)
*  The Sudanese army has recaptured the presidential palace in central Khartoum from the paramilitary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=0.0s)]
*  rapid support forces amid intense fighting. The strategic building was seized by the RSF which [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=5.76s)]
*  took control of the capital when civil war erupted nearly two years ago. This is a major victory for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=11.6s)]
*  the army which has been making significant advances against the RSF in recent months. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=17.2s)]
*  Our Africa correspondent Barbara Plet-Usher has more from Port Sudan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=22.32s)]
*  So this is a very crucial battle for control of the capital. It kind of centered in this. The army [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  has been advancing on Khartoum from the outlying areas over the recent months and now in recent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=32.32s)]
*  days it has been inching through central Khartoum blocked or obstructed by sniper fire from the RSF [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  but now that it has seized the presidential palace it effectively signals the end of the RSF's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=45.84s)]
*  control over the capital although it's still in other parts of the city fighting there. This area [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=53.04s)]
*  is a place where all of the financial institutions, the government ministries are so it's very [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=60.0s)]
*  strategic. It's also the palace quite a symbolically important building because it has historical and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=64.56s)]
*  political culture consequences and significance. So this is a major victory for the army. As I said [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  that doesn't end the fighting in the capital or parts of it but it does show that the army has [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=78.08s)]
*  taken a major step towards re-imposing itself on the seat of government which it has lost for two [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=82.96s)]
*  years. And the impact of this civil war has been huge hasn't it in terms of numbers of people killed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=89.2s)]
*  but also the sheer numbers who've been displaced by it. Oh yes I mean even in greater Khartoum which [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  includes the central part of the city but also outlying districts about three and a half million [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=102.24s)]
*  people have been displaced during this war. The number now is about 12 and 13 million around the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=106.24s)]
*  country. There's a hunger crisis in large parts of it. There's famine been declared in several [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  displacement camps that will probably expanded. There's been enormous destruction which we were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=118.0s)]
*  witnessing in Khartoum as we were looking at areas that the army had already reclaimed. And there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  is you know no power no electricity and a lot of death tens of thousands of people have died so [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=129.12s)]
*  the the consequences of the war mean that it is not going to be over anytime soon but also just [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=135.2s)]
*  the military dynamics because although the army looks as if it's going to regain control of the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=142.24s)]
*  capital that doesn't end the war. The RSF is controlling parts most of the west of the country [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=146.96s)]
*  large parts of the south of it. This could have significant impact on the direction of the fighting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=152.0s)]
*  going forward from here but there's been no sign that either side is ready to talk about peace or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=158.56s)]
*  end to this conflict. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IBsiH87p4&t=164.16s)]
