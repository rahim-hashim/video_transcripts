# What did Donald Trump achieve on his four-day visit to the Middle East? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y)
*  This week, the US has been doing deals across the Gulf region, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  as in recent months have Donald Trump's family businesses. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=4.0s)]
*  This is completely unprecedented. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=8.0s)]
*  We've never had a situation where a president has gone on a foreign trip abroad [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=10.0s)]
*  and only gone to countries where he has a personal financial interest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=15.0s)]
*  President Trump decided to begin the first major trip of his second term in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=21.0s)]
*  He signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal and said the US had no stronger partner. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=26.0s)]
*  Compare that to Joe Biden in 2019, who before winning the presidency, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=31.0s)]
*  vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=36.0s)]
*  That was because of the murder of Saudi journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=39.0s)]
*  a murder US intelligence concluded was ordered by Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=44.0s)]
*  And while as president, Joe Biden would choose to meet the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=50.0s)]
*  even so, Donald Trump's visit significantly warms US-Saudi relations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=55.0s)]
*  I like him too much, the president said of Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=60.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's business empire likes Saudi Arabia too. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=64.0s)]
*  The Trump Organization is run by the president's eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=68.0s)]
*  And before and after their father's election victory last year, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=73.0s)]
*  real estate deals in Saudi Arabia were signed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=76.0s)]
*  There's also the president's son-in-law and former adviser, Jared Kushner. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=80.0s)]
*  A private investment fund that he runs received a two billion dollar investment [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=85.0s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, which is controlled by the Saudi state. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=90.0s)]
*  The Saudi state, remember, is led by Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=95.0s)]
*  And this parallel deal making with the US administration and with the president's businesses [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=99.0s)]
*  is not restricted to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=104.0s)]
*  From there, the president flew to Qatar. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=107.0s)]
*  In April, a new Trump International Golf Club just outside Doha was announced. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=110.0s)]
*  A state-owned firm, Qatari Dia, put out a press release detailing its involvement, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=115.0s)]
*  along with the Saudi real estate company, Dar Global. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=120.0s)]
*  Eric Trump is quoted. He talks of being incredibly proud to work with both. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=123.0s)]
*  Later, though, the Trump Organization sought to clarify that the deal itself was with the Saudi firm, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=128.0s)]
*  but not with Qatari Dia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=134.0s)]
*  There's this too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=136.0s)]
*  Qatar has offered to gift a Boeing 747-8 for Mr. Trump to use during this term in office, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=137.0s)]
*  and the president's keen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=143.0s)]
*  I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, no, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=145.0s)]
*  But I thought it was a great gesture. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=151.0s)]
*  To senior Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, this amounts to premium foreign influence with extra legroom. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=154.0s)]
*  To prominent conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=160.0s)]
*  President Trump promised to drain the swamp. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=163.0s)]
*  This is not, in fact, draining the swamp, he says. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=166.0s)]
*  Or there's the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=169.0s)]
*  It's led by Pam Bondi, who Trump appointed as attorney general, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=171.0s)]
*  and who's a former lobbyist for the Qatari government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=175.0s)]
*  Multiple U.S. media reports say she's now provided a memo [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=178.0s)]
*  explaining that accepting the jet would be permissible. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=182.0s)]
*  Though that memo hasn't been made public. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=185.0s)]
*  And while the Qatari plane was being debated, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=188.0s)]
*  in Qatar itself, deals with the U.S. kept coming, including on defense and trade. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=191.0s)]
*  There was a steak dinner, too. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=197.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump called Qatar's ruling emir an outstanding man. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=199.0s)]
*  For Qatar, just as for Saudi Arabia, this messaging is progress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=203.0s)]
*  In 2017, during his first term, Trump had criticized Qatar, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=207.0s)]
*  claiming it had been a funder of terrorism at a very high level. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=211.0s)]
*  The last stop of the trip was the UAE. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=215.0s)]
*  It brought more deals with the U.S. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=218.0s)]
*  Trump's family businesses have been busy in the UAE, too. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=220.0s)]
*  There's a plan for a Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=224.0s)]
*  And then there's the Trump family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=228.0s)]
*  A state-backed fund in Abu Dhabi is using it to facilitate a $2 billion deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=232.0s)]
*  The crypto venture's website lists President Trump as chief crypto advocate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=238.0s)]
*  And two co-founders of this venture are Zach Witkoff and Alex Witkoff. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=243.0s)]
*  They're the sons of Steve Witkoff, who's listed as a co-founder emeritus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=248.0s)]
*  He's also a real estate investor, a golf buddy of Donald Trump's, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=253.0s)]
*  and the president's special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=257.0s)]
*  This three-country trip has, for some, raised concerns, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=261.0s)]
*  but the White House rejects them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=265.0s)]
*  It's told the BBC President Trump just secured trillions of dollars [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=267.0s)]
*  of investments into the U.S., which will create good-paying jobs [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=270.0s)]
*  and bolster economic growth, as we have repeated time and again [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=274.0s)]
*  there are no conflicts of interest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=277.0s)]
*  It's true, large deals with the U.S. government and U.S. business [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=280.0s)]
*  have been signed this week. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=283.0s)]
*  It's also true that Trump's business empire has changed its approach [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=285.0s)]
*  to potential conflicts of interest. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=289.0s)]
*  During Donald Trump's first term, the Trump Organization said [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=291.0s)]
*  it would no longer pursue overseas business ventures. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=294.0s)]
*  This time around, there's a commitment to no new transactions with foreign governments. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=298.0s)]
*  That is not the same and leaves plenty of space for deals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=304.0s)]
*  But Eric Trump has offered reassurances, promising a series of comprehensive [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=308.0s)]
*  ethical measures aimed at proactively addressing potential conflicts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=313.0s)]
*  But not everyone's convinced. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=317.0s)]
*  When Trump was elected for the second time, we were told that measures [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=320.0s)]
*  would be introduced to reduce conflicts of interest. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=323.0s)]
*  Yet, in practice, we've seen quite the opposite. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=326.0s)]
*  Rampant foreign entanglements, rampant conflicts of interest, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=329.0s)]
*  leading people to question whether what the president is doing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=333.0s)]
*  is in his interests or the national interest. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=337.0s)]
*  To those who question that, this is the White House response. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=340.0s)]
*  I think it's frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=344.0s)]
*  that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=347.0s)]
*  He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=351.0s)]
*  real estate empire for public service. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=355.0s)]
*  But while President Trump isn't running his businesses while in office, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=358.0s)]
*  he does still own them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=362.0s)]
*  And as a senior fellow at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute says, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=364.0s)]
*  even if he's not running the company, he profits when the company does well. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=368.0s)]
*  When he leaves the White House, the company is worth more. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=372.0s)]
*  His personal wealth goes up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=375.0s)]
*  All of which is why, once more, for better or for worse, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=377.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is taking the U.S. presidency well outside of accepted norms. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRR8UV8s_Y&t=381.0s)]
