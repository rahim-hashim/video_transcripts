Video Description: Billionaire Elon Musk has said he regrets some of the posts he made about US President Donald Trump during their war of words on social media.
 
"I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far," he said on his platform X.
 
The two were embroiled in a public fallout, after the Tesla owner called Trump's tax bill a "disgusting abomination".
 
The budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators.

# Elon Musk 'regrets' some Donald Trump posts | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o)
*  Now, after their bitter social media fallout, the Tesla boss Elon Musk has apologized for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=0.0s)]
*  posts he made about US President Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=6.4s)]
*  Writing on his platform X, Mr. Musk says, I regret some of my posts about President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=9.52s)]
*  Donald Trump last week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=15.8s)]
*  They went too far. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=17.8s)]
*  The backdrop here is, of course, the bitter war of words that culminated in the tech billionaire [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  suggesting without evidence that President Trump appears in unreleased files related [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=24.58s)]
*  to the late sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=30.02s)]
*  The situation has inevitably cast major doubts over Mr. Musk's various business interests [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  with the US government. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=38.94s)]
*  Well, to look at this story, I'm now joined by our business presenter, Sally Bandock. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  And Sally, how surprising is this latest post from Elon Musk? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=45.7s)]
*  Well, I would say it's not that surprising. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=49.86s)]
*  As you've just read out there, his post on X was, I regret some of my posts about President [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=53.58s)]
*  Trump last week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=60.76s)]
*  They went too far. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=61.76s)]
*  What kicked the spat off in the first place between these two men was his initial criticism [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  of what President Trump calls my big, beautiful bill, which is his really critical policy [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=70.1s)]
*  move that's currently going through the Senate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=75.8s)]
*  It needs approval in the Senate so that he can go ahead with what many argue is President [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=79.04s)]
*  Trump's biggest change in tax and spend, which will have huge implications for the US economy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  And Elon Musk was really critical of whether that was a good idea or not, accusing the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  president of putting the US economy in a perilous state because the level of debt would be far [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=97.0s)]
*  too high. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  And that's where it all started. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  But then we are all well aware, aren't we, of just how toxic that very public argument [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=104.7s)]
*  became between the two of them, mudslinging on Truth Social and X and where it sort of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  ended up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=117.7s)]
*  So now, with the days that have gone by and all the commentary and the analysis, Elon [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=118.7s)]
*  Musk is saying, I regret some parts, not all of it, but some of it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=124.48s)]
*  We're not sure which parts he regrets just yet, are we, Sally? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=129.22s)]
*  In terms of what was at stake for Elon Musk, we talked about the massive government contracts [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=132.92s)]
*  his companies have in the US and of course, Tesla's share price also took a hit after [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=138.18s)]
*  the spat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=143.82s)]
*  Just talk to us about what was at stake for him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=144.82s)]
*  Yeah, and what's still at stake, let's not forget, this does not mean by any means that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=147.14s)]
*  these two are going to start to be very good friends again by any means. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=151.46s)]
*  But for Elon Musk, his companies, we've got Tesla, of course, the electric vehicles company, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=156.36s)]
*  we've got SpaceX, got Starlink. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=161.7s)]
*  They all do a huge amount of business with the US government. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=164.42s)]
*  If I give you one example, SpaceX has been awarded almost $21 billion in US government [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=168.42s)]
*  contracts since 2008. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  That was according to analysis by BBC Verify. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=178.7s)]
*  And on Thursday last week, when this argument was just going beyond belief on social media, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=182.1s)]
*  Tesla shares went into freefall, dropping some 14%. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=189.42s)]
*  If we look at the share value now, they're down around 5% in the last five days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  And that's tens of billions of dollars in value wiped off the market capitalization [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=197.98s)]
*  of Tesla. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=203.22s)]
*  But there's very important things at stake here for Elon Musk. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=204.56s)]
*  So Tesla, at the end of this week, is actually going to be testing a batch of its robo taxes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=208.26s)]
*  in Austin, Texas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  He needs regulatory approval for that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  And also these other government contracts, Starlink, etc. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=220.05999999999997s)]
*  SpaceX I've mentioned, it's a very important relationship with the US government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=224.88s)]
*  But it's not something that can be unraveled quickly. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=229.76s)]
*  For example, the contracts SpaceX has with NASA, with the US government, that would take [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=232.16s)]
*  a lot of unraveling legally. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=237.76s)]
*  So it's not easily undone despite what's going on between President Trump and Elon Musk in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=239.2s)]
*  terms of their personal views and opinions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  But we'll see how this plays out going forward. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=248.06s)]
*  Because of course, Elon Musk has said in that latest post on X, he does regret some of his [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=250.94s)]
*  comments. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=255.7s)]
*  But as you say, Catherine, we don't know which ones, we don't know which details. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=256.7s)]
*  And this will go on and on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  So there'll be more to come to be continued. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=262.3s)]
*  And let's look forward to Sally. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=264.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=266.34s)]
*  That's our business presenter, Sally Bandock there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHZchlXQ80o&t=267.34s)]
