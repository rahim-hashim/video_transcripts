Video Description: Two weeks after US President Donald Trump declared the 12-day war between Iran and Israel was over, a seemingly fragile ceasefire appears to be holding.
 
Discussion over the extent of the damage to Iran’s nuclear sites from US strikes continues, with conflicting reports coming from the White House.
 
There are also reports Iran has turned to China in the hopes of acquiring advanced military capability, including J-10C fighter jets.

*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  It violates our security. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=3.2s)]
*  We need to expand. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=6.4s)]
*  As a military strategic plan or a former plan, you don't want politicians telegraphing what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  your next moves are going to be. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=13.08s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=14.4s)]
*  A peacekeeping force does not exist with a ceasefire. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=19.88s)]
*  Welcome to this week's Security Brief with me, Regina Vidyanathan and Mikey Kay. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=28.56s)]
*  It's been two weeks since President Trump announced on True Social that there was to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=33.76s)]
*  be a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after that 12-day conflict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=38.4s)]
*  Days earlier, American bombers targeted three Iranian nuclear sites in what many feared [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=43.28s)]
*  would be an escalation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  But as that ceasefire continues to hold, there are questions about what comes next, what's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=50.2s)]
*  the current state of Iran's nuclear capabilities and what will those reported talks between [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=54.88s)]
*  Iran and the US actually achieve? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  With me to discuss all of this as ever is our resident analyst, former senior officer [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  and assault helicopter pilot in the British military, Mikey Kay. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=68.56s)]
*  And as always, he will deliver his brief as he would to his generals. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Mikey, we're going to be taking a look later at Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=77.04s)]
*  We will. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=82.84s)]
*  But I wanted to start by asking you about some of the other significant developments [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=84.0s)]
*  when it comes to what's been going on with Iran and the military there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Regina, something that's really jumped out of me over the last week or two is what [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  we call the conventional warfare aspect. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=97.08s)]
*  So conventional means ordinary stuff like fighters, ships, tanks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=99.64s)]
*  And the most notable rumblings for me have been concerning the Chinese-made J-10C fighter jet. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=104.92s)]
*  And the Iranians are basically eyeing this up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the J-10C looks like. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=114.4s)]
*  This is the Chinese-made J-10C. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=116.4s)]
*  It's China's Chengdu J-10C fighter jet, also known as the Biggerest Dragon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  So they've given it quite an interesting name. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=124.48s)]
*  It's come to prominence following its use by Pakistan in the recent Kashmir conflict [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=127.04s)]
*  with India. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=130.68s)]
*  And really, it's a proven ability now to go toe to toe with Western-made, highly capable [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=131.68s)]
*  fourth generation fighters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=137.72s)]
*  So the J-10C is what's called multi-role. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=139.8s)]
*  So it can carry air-to-ground missiles, it can carry air-to-air missiles, or it can carry [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=142.36s)]
*  a combination of both. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  So just to be clear, Iran is eyeing these up, thinking of buying a load. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=152.8s)]
*  And the specifics are interesting here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=154.12s)]
*  So let's take a closer look, slide please, of the J-10C. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=155.8s)]
*  This is obviously a view from front on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=160.12s)]
*  Of note, you've got a fixed refueling probe to the top left of the picture. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  You've got canards, which are the smaller wings towards the front of the airplane that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=167.68s)]
*  makes the aircraft highly maneuverable. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=171.28s)]
*  But what's really interesting for me is what's inside that nose cone. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  So this jet has what's called, and I'm going to try and get my lips around this, active [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=177.6s)]
*  electronically scanned radar. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=182.12s)]
*  It's called an ESA radar. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=183.84s)]
*  What that basically means is it's a radar that can detect and track air-to-ground targets, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=185.52s)]
*  but at the same time, it can conduct electronic warfare missions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=191.84s)]
*  Now this is interesting because what it's doing is it's combining the capabilities of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  what usually require multiple platforms to do that into just one aircraft. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=201.52s)]
*  So just to put that into perspective, let's go slide. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=206.08s)]
*  This is a UK Typhoon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=208.8s)]
*  This is scheduled to have an upgrade on the ESA radar, but it doesn't quite have it currently. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  Whereas if we go and look at, next slide please, these two aircraft on the right, we have the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  F-22 US made Raptor. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=223.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a fifth generation aircraft. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=226.0s)]
*  That's got an ESA radar. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=228.04s)]
*  And on the left there, you've got the French Rafale. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=229.6s)]
*  That's referred to as a 4.5 generation aircraft because it doesn't quite have the fifth generation [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=232.12s)]
*  bits on it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=237.16s)]
*  So those two have it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=238.68s)]
*  The Typhoon has yet to receive it, but Iran are now looking at a capability which is equivalent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=240.32s)]
*  effectively to the radar that those two aircraft that you can see on the screen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=245.76s)]
*  So that's really stood out for me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=249.16s)]
*  Now, why are Iran looking at this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=251.52s)]
*  Well, part of Iran's fixed-wing air defence capability was historically US made and procured [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=254.0s)]
*  during the reign of the Shah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=259.48s)]
*  So pre-1979 Islamic State Revolution. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=261.12s)]
*  Let's take a look at the Iranian F-14. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=265.2s)]
*  This is the Tomcat. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=268.28s)]
*  Now, obviously, spares and maintenance are going to become an issue here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=269.28s)]
*  Post-1979, the US are not going to have any form of packages with Iran that give them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=272.72s)]
*  that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=277.16s)]
*  So the limitations meant that the shelf life of operating these jets were coming to an [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=278.16s)]
*  end anyway. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=282.32s)]
*  But if you add to that the degradation of these US made jets from recent IDF strikes, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=283.64s)]
*  it's no surprise really that Iran are looking for a new capability. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=288.12s)]
*  And can I just ask you, who has these AESA nosed jets then? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=292.64s)]
*  Which other countries? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=297.12s)]
*  Well, so as you saw from the slide, I don't know if we can go backslide on that, but the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=298.12s)]
*  French Rafale, which we saw on the left of the screen outside, I don't know if we can [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=301.2s)]
*  bring that up, and also the F-22 Raptor you can see on the right there, French made Rafale [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=304.52s)]
*  on the left. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  They do have these radars. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  The UK Typhoon is scheduled to have it, but is yet to receive it just yet. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=311.56s)]
*  What's in the mix as well as the J-10C for the Iranians is also the Su-35. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=315.88s)]
*  If we can go to a slide, I think we've got a picture of that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=320.64s)]
*  This is Russian made Su-35 Sukhoi. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=324.08s)]
*  I'm estimating that's going to be in the mix because Iran haven't confirmed or denied that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=327.28s)]
*  it's purchasing around 40 of the J-10Cs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=331.56s)]
*  But Iran has already ordered 24 of these jets from Russia a couple of years ago, but they're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=335.24s)]
*  yet to be operational. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=339.32s)]
*  If Iran sees that there's some form of delay in the production of these aircraft, then [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=341.12s)]
*  they might just flick to China for the J-10Cs. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=345.8s)]
*  OK, so that's the military changes going on, but of course in the conversation since those [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=349.12s)]
*  strikes there's also been a conversation around the Iranian government. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=355.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've seen a lot of rhetoric coming out of the US, not necessarily from [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=359.32000000000005s)]
*  the Trump admin, but from senators, from US media about regime change. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=364.12s)]
*  This is something I'm really quite passionate about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=370.08s)]
*  I spent three tours in Iraq and was personally involved in the assessments of the Afghan [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=371.84s)]
*  National Army in Afghanistan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  What I learned being in Iraq from 2003 to 2005 and 2006 is any regime attempts that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  create a security vacuum have been historically catastrophic, and we've seen that in Iraq. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=386.96s)]
*  The US is Paul Bremner. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=393.12s)]
*  He was put in as the head of the transitional authority just after the invasion of Iraq in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  2003. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=398.88s)]
*  He effectively fired all of Saddam's army, and what that did was it created a security [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=400.12s)]
*  vacuum that wasn't replaced, so a security vacuum being army and police, for example. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=404.12s)]
*  That wasn't replaced. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=409.08s)]
*  That allowed al-Qaeda in Iraq to thrive, who then morphed into Islamic State in Iraq, that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  then morphed into Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and then ultimately became the Islamic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=415.08s)]
*  State. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  And then from further experience of assessments on the Afghan National Army, even with all [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  of the resources, mentoring and equipment capability that was given to the Afghan National Army, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=424.96s)]
*  mostly by the Americans, there is no guarantee that success is going to come from that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=429.84s)]
*  And as we saw in Afghanistan with the Taliban now in power, it speaks for itself. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting, isn't it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=439.4s)]
*  Because it's not just about dropping bombs in certain places. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  But let's talk about some of the other targets. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=443.23999999999995s)]
*  We're going to get onto the nuclear sites in a minute. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=445.12s)]
*  But we understand that the Israelis also targeted Evin Prison, where the Iranian government [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=448.23999999999995s)]
*  had been holding political prisoners. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=455.4s)]
*  We long have reported on accusations that the Iranian government is trying to stifle [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=457.64s)]
*  any sort of dissent. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=462.24s)]
*  A lot of women have been taken to the streets over the years as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=463.24s)]
*  Just tell our viewers why Evin Prison is so significant. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=466.56s)]
*  For me, this was a massively counterproductive move that came, I think, on around day 11 [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=470.28s)]
*  of the 12-day conflict. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=475.64s)]
*  And the reason why I think it's counterproductive is, if we can go slide, we can see some battle [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  damage from this video. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  This is video footage of the damage created by the IDF airstrikes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=484.48s)]
*  71 prisoners were reportedly killed in the strikes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=488.16s)]
*  But these people inside this building were anti-regime. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=491.44s)]
*  They'd been put there because they were dissidents and they were anti-regime. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  And it just makes no sense that if there's an idea of creating regime change from within, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=499.36s)]
*  this would totally oppose that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=505.92s)]
*  And I think the estimates from talking to people who are dissident inside Iran, this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=507.72s)]
*  really didn't help their cause. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=513.68s)]
*  It's all really complex, isn't it? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=515.7199999999999s)]
*  And of course, one of the things that was talked about was the US's involvement, which [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=517.0s)]
*  was just over two weeks ago on a Saturday night where those B-2 bombers targeted three [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=523.3599999999999s)]
*  Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=529.66s)]
*  Before we go into the fallout from that, just remind us of those three sites. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=532.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's good. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=536.28s)]
*  It's been a couple of weeks now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=537.56s)]
*  But if we can go slide, we can just take a look at a quick, quick map towards the top [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  of that slide, you've got Tehran, the capital, and then the three main sites are almost directly [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=543.56s)]
*  south. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=547.4799999999999s)]
*  So you've got Fordow just below Tehran. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  This was the main target of the US. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  It's an enrichment facility that had over 2000 centrifuges deep underground. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  It had surface-to-air missile systems around it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=559.16s)]
*  So the Iranians obviously wanted to protect it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  Most of the bunker busters, the GBU-57, which I'll talk about in a second, were placed on [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  Fordow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=568.56s)]
*  was also a target of the B-2s, but not to the extent of Fordow. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=569.76s)]
*  And then you've got Isfahan just below that, which is the nuclear research center. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=573.92s)]
*  And that was hit by Tomahawk land attack missiles. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  But if we can go slide, we can take a closer look on the Fordow facility. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=582.64s)]
*  This is what they call battle damage assessments, BDAs, the main target of the B-2s and the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=586.64s)]
*  GBU-57s, that massive ordnance penetrator or MOP as they were talking. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=592.16s)]
*  And you can basically see to the white building on the right, if you go to the left of that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=597.36s)]
*  shot, you can see three craters in the top bit of the shot. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=602.36s)]
*  And then that's the grouping just below that was on the left-hand slide. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=607.96s)]
*  Now you're not seeing massive craters. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=611.4s)]
*  The GBU-57 has a 13,600-kilogram head on it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=613.2s)]
*  It's 30,000 pounds. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=619.12s)]
*  That's a huge bomb, but it doesn't explode on the surface. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=620.76s)]
*  It goes deep into the ground, the terrain, about 200 feet. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=622.88s)]
*  So most of the explosions would have occurred under that, as I said, mostly on Fordow. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=626.76s)]
*  And then you have Isfahan that was attacked by sea-based US warships carrying what's called [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=633.1600000000001s)]
*  the T-Lam, the Tomahawk land attack missile that travels subsonic, but it can go really [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  low. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=643.28s)]
*  So it's really hard to detect by radar. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=644.28s)]
*  Mikey, I was in Washington the night that President Trump came out with some of his [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=645.52s)]
*  top team to announce that the US had targeted those sites in Iran. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=650.4s)]
*  In that short address that he delivered to the nation, he claimed that those sites had [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=656.16s)]
*  been obliterated. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=661.28s)]
*  He said that Iran's nuclear capabilities had effectively been taken out for a long time. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=662.28s)]
*  Since then, we've heard different views on that and the length of which they have been [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=668.24s)]
*  decimated for. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=672.48s)]
*  What do we know at the moment now? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=674.76s)]
*  Well, let's just go back to... [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=676.44s)]
*  I watched on set Trump's press conference with the Joint Chiefs General, Dan Cain. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=678.6s)]
*  Don't mention the word obliterated. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=684.88s)]
*  That's not a term we use in military parlance. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=686.24s)]
*  It's way more nuanced than that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=688.2800000000001s)]
*  It's about destroying, degrading, deterring. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=689.76s)]
*  But when the Joint Chiefs came out, his assessment was way more nuanced, but didn't quite align [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  to obliterated. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=700.12s)]
*  Then came that intelligence leak and the headlines from that leak were that the centrifuges [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=701.12s)]
*  were mainly intact, over 2,000 of them in Fordow. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=706.12s)]
*  They're used to enrich uranium. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=709.0s)]
*  60% was what the IA said back in May. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=711.36s)]
*  90% is the key metric. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=714.2s)]
*  But also there was that 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium-235 that the IAE came out [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=716.32s)]
*  with in May to report. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=722.8s)]
*  And the Intel leak effectively said that that had been moved. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=724.76s)]
*  So the assessment of Iran's program had been, according to the intelligence leak, put back [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=727.48s)]
*  by a matter of months. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=732.0s)]
*  But the White House responding, the White House Fox saying that the top secret assessments [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=733.6s)]
*  were, quote, flat out wrong. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=737.64s)]
*  However, we then saw Rafael Grossi, who's the head of the IAEA, the International Atomic [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  Agency. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=743.12s)]
*  And he has since said that the US strikes on the three facilities we've just seen had [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=744.12s)]
*  caused severe but not total, quote, unquote, not total damage. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=749.96s)]
*  So contradicting Trump's obliterated comment and also saying that Iran could start enriching [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=753.76s)]
*  again in roughly months. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJFxhr8z3Q&t=758.6s)]
