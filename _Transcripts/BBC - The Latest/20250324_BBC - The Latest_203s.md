**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo)
*  Now, the online influencer and self-styled misogynist Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=0.0s)]
*  have visited a police station in Romania's capital Bucharest to register with the authorities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=6.44s)]
*  That is a legal formality as part of their ongoing criminal case. They are under investigation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=12.32s)]
*  for serious crimes including human trafficking and money laundering. Andrew Tate is also [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=17.6s)]
*  accused of rape. They both deny all the charges. They left Romania late last month after a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=22.38s)]
*  two-year travel ban on them was lifted. This is Andrew Tate speaking to the press after [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=28.4s)]
*  coming out of the police station. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=32.96s)]
*  Are you going to go back to America or how long are you going to stay in Romania? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm not convicted of any crimes. I'm a free person who has not been convicted [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=39.0s)]
*  of anything just as the same as you are or anyone else here. So I can take a holiday [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=42.96s)]
*  anywhere I want. I can go to Greece, I can go to Australia, I can go anywhere I like. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  So I'm not sure. But for now, I'm happy to be back in Romania. This is where I live. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I love Romania very much and I'm going to spend the next few weeks in Romania probably [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=52.92s)]
*  unless I decide spontaneously to leave. And I will do that as long as I obey my obligations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=56.64s)]
*  to the court, which I of course will do. I'm allowed to go anywhere I like. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=62.52s)]
*  And how often will you come to the police? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=65.56s)]
*  If they call me, I'll come. If they don't call me, I'll be busy living my life. I think [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  we've all realized by now everyone with a brain knows this case is going nowhere. This [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  case will be over sooner or later. Anyone with a brain can understand that. So it's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=75.28s)]
*  just a matter of paperwork and administration now. We can talk about how it's unfair. They've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=78.64s)]
*  just tried to destroy my life for three years. But God puts us through things to test us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=83.04s)]
*  And I believe that God put me through this to test me. And I think I've done a flawless, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=87.68s)]
*  fantastic job of persevering and refusing to be browbeaten. So it's been an interesting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=91.48s)]
*  experience and it'll soon be coming to an end. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=98.76s)]
*  Andrew Tait there. Our correspondent Will Vernon has the latest from Bucharest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=101.68s)]
*  Yeah, so the Tait brothers are accused here under a criminal investigation in Romania [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=105.56s)]
*  of forming an organized criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  laundering. That's both the brothers. And Andrew Tait alone is under investigation for rape [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=117.48s)]
*  and sex with a minor. They deny all those allegations. I mean, you heard there that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=122.88s)]
*  very long tirade really from Andrew Tait covering all kinds of conspiracy theories about the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=127.0s)]
*  media, what he calls the matrix, which is basically anyone who doesn't agree with him [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=134.36s)]
*  or any journalist who ask him a tough question, frankly. You know, a lot of claims there from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=139.68s)]
*  Andrew Tait that these accusations are completely groundless. But the truth of the matter is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=147.6s)]
*  the Taits face a number of different criminal investigations, not only here in Romania. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=151.84s)]
*  By the way, it's true that at the moment no official charges have been filed. There were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=159.44s)]
*  some charges filed before, but they were sent back to the judge. There's been all kinds [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=164.28s)]
*  of legal battles going on here and confusion over charges. Not only does he face a criminal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=168.36s)]
*  investigation here and his brother, but also in the U.S. A criminal investigation was opened [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=174.68s)]
*  last month shortly after the brothers arrived there. And of course, in Britain as well, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=179.28s)]
*  the Tait brothers are wanted in relation to allegations of rape and people trafficking. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=183.72000000000003s)]
*  And the BBC has spoken to a number of different women who make serious allegations against [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=190.36s)]
*  So, you know, there are an awful lot of questions and allegations about the conduct of these [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=195.08s)]
*  two brothers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hrvULfPAo&t=201.84s)]
