Video Description: British TV presenter Phillip Schofield has said he has "lost everything" and that his "career is over" following the affair he had with a young male colleague.

The former This Morning presenter apologised but said the pair were "not boyfriends" and they only had five or six romantic encounters over a few months.

However, Schofield said the affair "was a grave error", adding: "I shouldn't have done it."

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc)
*  You've had quite the week. How are you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=0.0s)]
*  I think... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=11.64s)]
*  I understand... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=15.72s)]
*  how Caroline Flack felt. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=18.12s)]
*  Last week... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=27.28s)]
*  if my... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=29.28s)]
*  daughters hadn't been there... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=32.76s)]
*  then... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=37.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And they've... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  guarded me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=46.44s)]
*  And won't let me out of their sight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  It's like a weird... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=53.08s)]
*  numbness. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=55.44s)]
*  I know that's a selfish point of view. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=57.76s)]
*  But you've come to a point... [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=62.64s)]
*  where you just think... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  how much... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=67.44s)]
*  are you... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=68.92s)]
*  supposed to take? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=70.36s)]
*  If... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  all of those people that write all of that stuff... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=75.0s)]
*  do they ever think... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=80.0s)]
*  that there's actually... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=83.08s)]
*  a person at the other end? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=84.92s)]
*  And so... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=89.4s)]
*  here I am, um... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=93.88s)]
*  Yeah. Are you feeling OK to do this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=95.48s)]
*  Are you feeling strong enough to do this interview? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=97.8s)]
*  Yeah, I have to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=99.88s)]
*  Why? Why do you want to do this interview? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=101.32s)]
*  Because there is an innocent person here... [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=103.16s)]
*  who didn't do anything wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=107.16s)]
*  Who is vulnerable... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=109.16s)]
*  and probably feels like I do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=112.8s)]
*  And... [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=115.08s)]
*  I just... [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=117.56s)]
*  have to say... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=119.12s)]
*  stop with him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=121.08s)]
*  OK with me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  But stop with him. Leave him alone now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=124.6s)]
*  You mention this young man. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=127.32s)]
*  And at the centre of recent events is a young man who, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=129.32s)]
*  together with many others in the media, we're not going to name. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=131.48s)]
*  But I'm sure you've heard of him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=134.04s)]
*  He's a young man who's been in the media for a long time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=135.72s)]
*  He's a young man who's been in the media, we're not going to name. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=138.2s)]
*  Under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, he has a right to privacy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  And he's not here today to give his own account of events. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=143.76s)]
*  When did you last speak to him? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=146.56s)]
*  Um... [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=148.56s)]
*  as I engaged the lawyer for him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=150.56s)]
*  Um...so... [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=156.56s)]
*  he needed independent support. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=158.56s)]
*  And so that was the last time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=161.56s)]
*  Is that a few weeks ago now? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=163.56s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of weeks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=165.56s)]
*  How concerned are you about his welfare right now? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=167.96s)]
*  Massively. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=169.96s)]
*  Massively concerned. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=171.96s)]
*  When did you first meet this young man in question? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=173.96s)]
*  What were the circumstances? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=175.96s)]
*  I was invited by a friend of mine to go to open a drama school. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=177.96s)]
*  And that's where the picture was taken. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=183.96s)]
*  Um... [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=185.96s)]
*  whether it was immediately or sometime after, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=187.96s)]
*  he said, will you follow him on Twitter? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=191.96s)]
*  Because he's a fan. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=193.96s)]
*  So I said, yeah, sure. No problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=195.96s)]
*  Which I did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=197.96s)]
*  And he was, what, 15 at the time? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=199.96s)]
*  Yeah. But I follow 11,300 people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=201.96s)]
*  And in all the time I've been on Twitter, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=205.96s)]
*  there has never been any whiff of impropriety. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=207.96s)]
*  And how often were you in touch with him? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=211.96s)]
*  Hardly at all. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=213.96s)]
*  He then said that he was interested in television. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=215.96s)]
*  Okay, good luck. Good luck. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=219.96s)]
*  Anything I can do to help? Probably. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=221.96s)]
*  That's what I normally say. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=223.96s)]
*  Um... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=225.96s)]
*  And that was it for a while. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=227.96s)]
*  And then he asked if he could visit the studios, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=231.96s)]
*  work experience type of thing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=239.96s)]
*  I said, well, you can come down and have a look for sure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=241.96s)]
*  Which he did. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=243.96s)]
*  How old was he when he first said to you, I'm interested in television? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=245.96s)]
*  Was he 18 by that point? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=247.96s)]
*  19 then, I would think. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=249.96s)]
*  If you look back now, if you were to look back at those messages now, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=251.96s)]
*  is there any sense in which you were flirting with him? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=255.96s)]
*  No. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  I've been 41 years in television. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  Nothing like this before. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  No accusations. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is all accusations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  And then when you met him in person, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  was there a little moment of sexual attraction then even? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  So to be absolutely clear, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=279.96s)]
*  how old was this young man when you first had any kind of sexual contact with him? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=281.96s)]
*  20. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=287.96s)]
*  20. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=289.96s)]
*  I mean, this is obviously the number of it, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=291.96s)]
*  and for the record and to put speculation to rest, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=293.96s)]
*  let me ask you directly, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=295.96s)]
*  did you have any kind of sexual relationship or sex with him when he was underage? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=297.96s)]
*  No, God, no. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=301.96s)]
*  I think that is, in my statement, it says, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=303.96s)]
*  consensual relationship, fully legal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=307.96s)]
*  I mean, that was approved by both sides. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=309.96s)]
*  He'd been working at the show for a few months. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=311.96s)]
*  And we'd become mates. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=319.96s)]
*  We were mates. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=321.96s)]
*  You know, we were around the studios, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=323.96s)]
*  you'd hang out together, you'd chat to each other, that sort of stuff. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=325.96s)]
*  And then in my dressing room one day, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=329.96s)]
*  something happened. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=335.96s)]
*  Um, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=339.96s)]
*  which, you know, obviously I will regret forever for him and for me, mostly him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=343.96s)]
*  But it, that happened maybe four or five times over the next few months. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=355.96s)]
*  And I know it's unforgivable. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=365.96s)]
*  Um, but we weren't boyfriends. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=373.96s)]
*  We weren't in a relationship. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=377.96s)]
*  I was really in a mess with my own sexuality at the time. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=381.96s)]
*  And it just happened. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=387.96s)]
*  How old was he at this stage? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=393.96s)]
*  Twenty-one. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=397.96s)]
*  Who knew on the team? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=399.96s)]
*  Nobody. To my knowledge. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=401.96s)]
*  I mean, somebody has to know something for there to be a rumor later on. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=403.96s)]
*  I didn't believe that anybody knew. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=409.96s)]
*  And did you ever tell Holly Willoughby? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=413.96s)]
*  No, God no. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=415.96s)]
*  That's a bigger question because we have, our make-up room was like a sanctuary. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=417.96s)]
*  Um, has always been a sanctuary. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=423.96s)]
*  So you tell everything in that room. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=427.96s)]
*  Holly knows everything about me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=429.96s)]
*  I know everything about Holly. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=431.96s)]
*  Holly did not know. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=433.96s)]
*  Nobody knew. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=435.96s)]
*  And did you tell her? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=437.96s)]
*  No, I didn't tell anybody. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=439.96s)]
*  I mean the reason this matters is because it is about potential abuse of power. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=441.96s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=445.96s)]
*  And that is a very, very valid question to put to me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=447.96s)]
*  And people would say the circumstances are as follows here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=451.96s)]
*  You met someone who was a child. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=455.96s)]
*  You were in a position of power over them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=457.96s)]
*  You used your power eventually to give them something they craved, which was a job in the media. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=459.96s)]
*  And they might ask what's the difference between that and grooming? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=465.96s)]
*  Well I would say that your initial list of things was not right anyway. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=469.96s)]
*  Tell me why? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=475.96s)]
*  Because it was a totally innocent picture, a totally innocent Twitter follow, of which I follow 11,400 people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=477.96s)]
*  And then it was a completely innocent backwards and forwards over a period of time about a job, about careers. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=483.96s)]
*  What's wrong with talking to someone, no matter what age they are? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=491.96s)]
*  Does that mean that if you are following anyone on Twitter that you absolutely don't talk to anybody else or you don't give advice? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=495.96s)]
*  So I disagree with the summation that you just gave because that does paint a very grave picture. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=503.96s)]
*  Do you know if he has signed an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement, preventing him from speaking? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=509.96s)]
*  No. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=514.96s)]
*  You don't know if he has? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=515.96s)]
*  No. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=516.96s)]
*  Did I make him sign an NDA? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=517.96s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=518.96s)]
*  But there's a question of whether or not he was, as it were, paid off. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=519.96s)]
*  In effect, if he was paid off, was he paid for his silence? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=522.96s)]
*  No, God no. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=525.96s)]
*  So is he free to speak if he wants to? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=526.96s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=528.96s)]
*  I mean what he wants is for all of this to go away. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=530.96s)]
*  He wants a quiet life. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=534.96s)]
*  And just on a couple of points of information, just to be clear, you are currently on an on-go basis. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=536.96s)]
*  You're paying for his legal advice and support. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=541.96s)]
*  Has there ever been or is there an injunction or any sort of NDA preventing media coverage of your relationship with him? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=544.96s)]
*  No. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=551.96s)]
*  Why is all this coming out now, Philip? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=552.96s)]
*  What was the catalyst? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=553.96s)]
*  What changed? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=554.96s)]
*  It got too big. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=555.96s)]
*  The lie got too big for both of us. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=556.96s)]
*  It just got enormous. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=559.96s)]
*  It was growing and growing and growing. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=561.96s)]
*  And it crossed over from online to mainstream news. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=564.96s)]
*  ITV's position is that they, and they've only put out one statement about all this, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=572.96s)]
*  they say they investigate allegations of an improper relationship and they were told by both you and the young man that there was no relationship. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=577.96s)]
*  In retrospect, was that investigation a sham? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=584.96s)]
*  Because it clearly didn't get to the truth, did it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=587.96s)]
*  I think if you have two people who are lying, then what can you do? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=589.96s)]
*  What did that investigation amount to? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=594.96s)]
*  I mean, was it just a phone call to you and a phone call to the young man? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=596.96s)]
*  Was it sort of a proper sort of independent... [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=599.96s)]
*  I think he was asked quite a bit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=600.96s)]
*  I was asked a couple of times. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=602.96s)]
*  So, you know, it's... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=604.96s)]
*  And it wasn't formal. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=606.96s)]
*  Is this the tip of the iceberg? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=607.96s)]
*  Are there more allegations or revelations have come or as far as you're concerned, is it all out there? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=609.96s)]
*  It's my biggest, sorriest secret. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=613.96s)]
*  When did you last speak to Holly Winnerby? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=616.96s)]
*  I WhatsApped her on the day that I put the statement up and I said to her, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=619.96s)]
*  I know you can't reply. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=626.96s)]
*  You're probably not allowed to, but please know that I am so desperately, desperately sorry. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=628.96s)]
*  Did she reply? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=636.96s)]
*  No. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpqYETAsSqc&t=637.96s)]
