**BBC - The Latest:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs)
*  A two-day global summit is underway in Paris to discuss the future of artificial intelligence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=0.0s)]
*  The AI Action Summit is billed as a discussion on how to balance the development of the technology [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=6.16s)]
*  with its impact on society and the environment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=11.72s)]
*  Among those attending are US Vice President JD Vance, who arrived at Orly Airport in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  French capital with family members on board Air Force Two. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=20.28s)]
*  The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also in Paris, as well as China's Vice Premier [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=24.66s)]
*  Deng Shouei-Chi, as well as the bosses of Google and OpenAI. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=29.72s)]
*  Our AI correspondent Mark Cieslak reports. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=34.64s)]
*  A host of world leaders, top tech executives and AI experts are gathering in Paris for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=41.76s)]
*  the AI Action Summit. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=47.36s)]
*  Discussions on AI safety and regulation will likely take a back seat as event organisers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=50.0s)]
*  say the summit will be more concerned with immediate issues such as AI's effect on jobs [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  and the environment, as well as AI's development for the betterment of humanity or the public [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=59.8s)]
*  good. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=64.76s)]
*  For a week ahead of the AI Action Summit, the French government has laid on a number [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  of scientific and cultural events, like this art exhibition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=69.6s)]
*  A lot of the work here explores the opportunities, but also talks about the race to become an [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=73.88s)]
*  AI global superpower, a theme that's likely to emerge at the summit itself. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=80.32s)]
*  Against this background of global competition, what does the UK hope to get from the summit? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=88.92s)]
*  All these senior people from government are coming together and they're going to be colliding [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=97.56s)]
*  together with the tech sector, but also those investors out there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=101.24s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of conversations about where we are with safety, where the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=106.38s)]
*  technology is going, the relationships, the global relationships, because AI is becoming [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=109.36s)]
*  an increasingly important factor in global power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=113.8s)]
*  But my job is also to be going round to all of these people, telling them about the scale [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=118.4s)]
*  of British ambition, to talk about the investment opportunities that we have back there in Britain, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=122.52s)]
*  and ensuring that everybody who comes here leaves knowing full well just what the potential [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=128.92s)]
*  of Britain is in the digital age. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=135.04s)]
*  The summit's hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=138.44s)]
*  Congratulations, Mr. Vice President. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=141.8s)]
*  In attendance will be US Vice President JD Vance and tech CEOs Sam Altman of OpenAI and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=144.0s)]
*  Saddam Husabis of Google DeepMind, as well as Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guocheng and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=149.64s)]
*  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi co-chairing the whole event. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=155.28s)]
*  But as policymakers debate the future, a new disruptive Chinese AI model DeepSeek has shaken [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=160.32s)]
*  up the industry with its cheaper approach to developing the technology. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=166.4s)]
*  Industry experts worry that competition between nations and tech companies could be to the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=171.84s)]
*  detriment of developing this technology safely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  The biggest challenge in Paris will likely be balancing this competition against the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=179.64s)]
*  summit's ambition to support AI technology that benefits all humanity. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=183.94s)]
*  Mark Chislak, BBC News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=189.88s)]
*  And let's join Mark live in Paris now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=192.68s)]
*  Mark, just picking up on that point you made at the end of your report, there's a bit of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=195.72s)]
*  an arms race, isn't there, frankly, in terms of AI development? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=199.44s)]
*  So has the horse already bolted from the stable of regulation? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, at the moment, one of the most interesting aspects of this particular summit has been [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=206.4s)]
*  looking at all of the vying for position, seeing who is going to become the next global [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=212.96s)]
*  AI superpower. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=218.96s)]
*  When we think about regulation and safety, a lot of those things have taken a bit of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=220.96s)]
*  a backseat at this summit in comparison to the first AI summit at Bletchley Park in 2023. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=223.92s)]
*  That was labeled as an AI safety summit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=230.24s)]
*  This is an AI action summit. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  But most interestingly, a lot of the industry experts that I've spoken to, people at the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  very, very top of their game, quite a few of them have said that safety is still a massive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=238.32s)]
*  concern. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=243.68s)]
*  It's an issue that hasn't yet been fully resolved. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=244.68s)]
*  Yes, because if they say that part of the mission for these two days is to think about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=246.88s)]
*  AI's impact on society, on the environment, well, naturally, safety is part of that, isn't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=251.76s)]
*  it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=257.8s)]
*  So how consequential will these two days be? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=258.8s)]
*  Can we expect any sort of joint statement at the end of them? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=261.72s)]
*  Yes, it is very likely there will be a declaration at the end of the event, but there isn't going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=265.6s)]
*  to be anything new on regulation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=271.28s)]
*  The most important thing about events like these is bringing together people from politics, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=273.44s)]
*  bringing together people from technology, people that have the ability to change the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=277.8s)]
*  dial, the decision makers, putting them all in the same space and letting them have a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=281.44s)]
*  conversation about where this technology might go in the next few years and more importantly, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=285.66s)]
*  how it might benefit all of our lives. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7wwGoLrKs&t=290.64s)]
