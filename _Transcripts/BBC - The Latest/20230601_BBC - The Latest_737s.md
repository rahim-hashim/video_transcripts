Video Description: Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has denied fuelling a culture of misogyny and defended his reputation in a combative interview with the BBC.

When the BBC put a range of allegations to him - including specific accusations of rape, human trafficking and exploiting women, for which he is being investigated by Romanian prosecutors - he dismissed them.

This was Mr Tate's first television interview with a major broadcaster since being released into house arrest from police custody in Romania in April.

He agreed to the interview with no set conditions.

# Andrew Tate BBC interview: Influencer challenged on misogyny and rape allegations - BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY)
*  Now, the BBC has questioned the controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate at his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=0.0s)]
*  home in the Romanian capital Bucharest. Tate is under house arrest and being investigated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=5.36s)]
*  by Romanian prosecutors for accusations including rape, human trafficking and exploiting women, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=9.76s)]
*  which he denies. The BBC challenged him on whether his views about women broadcast to his millions of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=15.68s)]
*  online followers harmed young people, as many teachers and police officers claim. Well, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=21.68s)]
*  the interview, which had no set conditions, was Tate's first since being released into [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=26.96s)]
*  house arrest from police custody last month. Lucy Williamson reports now from Bucharest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=31.84s)]
*  We are doing an interview with you because you're facing some very serious allegations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=38.8s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=46.0s)]
*  Rape, human trafficking. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=46.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  And also because there's a great deal of concern about the things you say and the impact that they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=49.2s)]
*  have on young people, on women. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=56.16s)]
*  I don't think the concerns about the things I say, I think the concern is for the level [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  of influence I have and the reach I have. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=62.8s)]
*  Let's start with the allegations. Have you raped anybody? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=64.72s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Have you trafficked anybody? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=69.28s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=70.8s)]
*  Exploited any women for money? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=72.96s)]
*  But you have admitted using emotional manipulation to get women to work in the webcam industry for you? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=74.32s)]
*  No. We have an open criminal investigation. I am absolutely not really sure I'll be found innocent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  I know the case better than you. I know it intimately and you don't. I have seen all the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=85.44s)]
*  criminal files and the evidence against me and you haven't. I know the truth of what happens and you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=89.28s)]
*  don't. And I'm telling you absolutely not really, I've never hurt anybody, that the case that's been [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=93.52s)]
*  put against me is completely and utterly fabricated and I'm never going to be found guilty of anything. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=98.08s)]
*  And it's very difficult for me to answer your in-depth questions because we're sitting here [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  inside of the territory of Romania. I am beholden to the Romanian legal system and I'm not going [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=104.8s)]
*  to incriminate myself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=108.72s)]
*  Let me read you then what you have said about what you have done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=109.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=113.28s)]
*  You have said my job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, get her to fall in love [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=114.16s)]
*  with me to the point where she'd do anything I say and then get her on webcam so we could become [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=120.0s)]
*  rich together. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=124.56s)]
*  I don't think that's what I personally said. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=125.44s)]
*  That's exactly what you said on your website. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  No, I've never said that. That's something that you've found on the internet. Doesn't mean I've said it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=129.12s)]
*  In your words. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=133.68s)]
*  And again, once again, if any female on the planet has a problem with me, I strongly recommend her to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=134.24s)]
*  go to the police and try and pursue me for criminal charges. I'm actually such a nice person. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=140.32s)]
*  The BBC has spoken to somebody since your arrest who says exactly those things that with you, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=144.16s)]
*  it's all manipulation. There's an ulterior motive to everything you do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, Sophie, the fake name, no face. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=154.56s)]
*  I was so intent on wanting to please him and wanting him to be happy that I was just kind of, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  yeah, okay, do whatever you want. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=162.4s)]
*  And what does she accuse me of a crime, this imaginary Sophie? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=164.0s)]
*  She's making the point that there is a- [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Has she accused me of a crime? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=169.04s)]
*  Emotional or psychological manipulation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=170.0s)]
*  I've asked you a question and I've allowed you into my house. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=171.84s)]
*  I'm asking you a question. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=173.84s)]
*  Correct, but you're not the boss here because I've allowed you into my house. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=174.96s)]
*  I'm asking you the questions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=177.6s)]
*  Correctly, and I'm telling you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=178.72s)]
*  You get to decide the answers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=179.84s)]
*  No, we're equal here. I've allowed you into my house. You don't come here with a position of authority. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=181.12s)]
*  I'm doing you the favor as legacy media, giving you relevance by speaking to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=185.92s)]
*  And I'm telling you now, this Sophie, which the BBC has invented, which is no face of, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=189.76s)]
*  nobody knows who she is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=193.6s)]
*  The BBC did not invent her. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=194.56s)]
*  Of course not. And she, because you never invent anything. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=195.76s)]
*  And she has not filed criminal charges against me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=198.0s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=201.28s)]
*  What is she saying? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=202.48s)]
*  We're talking about emotional manipulation into the sex industry for your financial gain. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=203.04s)]
*  Absolute garbage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=206.88s)]
*  I'm describing women who are going to court to accuse you of rape and human trafficking. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=207.76s)]
*  Sophie isn't on the court. Sophie doesn't exist. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=212.32s)]
*  And I'm describing women who have spoken to the BBC at length. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=213.28s)]
*  Sophie doesn't exist. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=216.56s)]
*  And other media organizations about what they say is emotional manipulation and coercion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=217.2s)]
*  And I'm quoting back to you your own words where you describe- [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=222.56s)]
*  They're not my words. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=226.24s)]
*  Coercion. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=226.8s)]
*  And emotional manipulation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=227.52s)]
*  They're words you found on the internet and Sophie doesn't exist. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=228.56s)]
*  On your website. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=231.12s)]
*  So let's move on to the next subject. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=231.28s)]
*  In your voice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Move on to the next subject. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=233.44s)]
*  No, I think I'll stick on this one for a minute. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=234.8s)]
*  So there's other places in that same website where you say you get girls to fall in love [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=236.72s)]
*  with you and they do it because they love you, because they want to do what you say. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Convincing women to take part in some kind of business arrangement doesn't work long term [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  because they're emotional. You've got to get them to fall in love with you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=249.68s)]
*  Once again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=252.56s)]
*  That's coercion. That's emotional manipulation. That's abuse. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=252.72s)]
*  What you've found are clips from the internet, some text from the internet, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=255.2s)]
*  and you're going to sit here and tell me that that's the reason I should be- [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=259.28s)]
*  Your website, your words. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=262.0s)]
*  It's not my website. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=263.44s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=264.88s)]
*  No, it's not. Check my website. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=265.44s)]
*  Next. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=267.84s)]
*  It's the website you've taken down and I wonder why those comments have been taken down. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=269.76s)]
*  My website, no website's been taken down. My website is the same and it's been the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=273.12s)]
*  same for a very long time. You are accusing me, I'm guessing, what you're trying to say [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=275.68s)]
*  is you're accusing me and you're trying to say that I'm guilty of the things I'm accused of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=279.44s)]
*  and I'm emotionally manipulating people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm saying that you have said you emotionally manipulated people here for your own financial gain. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=283.68s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=289.2s)]
*  It's not only about the criminal allegations. It's a much bigger issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=290.32s)]
*  You've got children's organizations in the UK. You've got rape organizations in the UK. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=294.88s)]
*  You've got the police naming you by name as someone who has a harmful influence on children [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  and on women in the UK and elsewhere because of the things you say, because of the way you present [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=305.68s)]
*  gender relations, the way you say men should treat women. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=311.92s)]
*  That's very upsetting and the reason that's very upsetting is because I know that's not true. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=314.8s)]
*  I'm genuinely a good person. I believe my impact on the world is positive. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=318.32s)]
*  The reason we're asking you about these comments is because we've got the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  chief executive of Rape Crisis naming you individually as spreading a dangerous ideology [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  of misogynistic rape culture. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=333.12s)]
*  Absolute. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  It's the comments you make that are leading people to say things like this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=336.0s)]
*  Absolute garbage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  National organizations who are blaming you for increasing levels of misogyny. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=340.4s)]
*  Schools that are saying they are having increased incidents of girls being attacked, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  of female teachers being harassed by pupils because of you and your teaching and your influence. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  That's absolute garbage. I have never, ever encouraged a student to attack a teacher, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=356.4s)]
*  male or female, ever. I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete. I preach anti-drug. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  I preach religion. I preach no alcohol. I preach no knife crime. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=366.64s)]
*  Every single problem with modern society I'm against. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=370.88s)]
*  I'm teaching young men to be disciplined, to be diligent, to listen, to train, to work hard, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=374.56s)]
*  to be exactly like me. I'm saying that if men grew up like me, which are hard working and diligent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=379.44s)]
*  and it's emotional control and stoic, we're going to have a better society, not a worse society. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  To sit here and say that schools in England, England, which is a failing nation, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=387.28s)]
*  which has knife crime going through the roof, violence going through the roof, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=391.28s)]
*  men's mental health going through the roof, and they're going to all blame me because I appeared [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=394.24s)]
*  on the internet one year ago. You set an image of success. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=397.52s)]
*  It's disingenuous. You set an image of financial success with a Bugatti and a cigar, but it comes [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=400.16s)]
*  with a side order of misogyny. How does having a Bugatti and a cigar come with a misogyny? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=405.52s)]
*  I am asking you about things that you have said that have caused major national organizations, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=410.64s)]
*  including the police, to worry about you by name. That's what I'm asking you about. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=415.92s)]
*  It's not what I said. It's about what you have said that has caused [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=421.12s)]
*  such concern in the UK. I want to put it to you that you don't really care about the harm it causes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=423.68s)]
*  because making controversial statements like this online has made you a lot of money. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=430.56s)]
*  Okay. Firstly, I genuinely am a force for good in the world. You may not understand that yet, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=435.44s)]
*  but you will eventually. I genuinely believe I'm acting under the instruction of God to do [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=440.24s)]
*  good things and I want to make the world a better place. I genuinely believe my legacy is a good [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=445.44s)]
*  legacy. I believe that eventually when the legacy media catches up, they're going to understand I'm [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=449.68s)]
*  a good positive influence. I'm not interested in damaging the world for money because if I was [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=453.44s)]
*  interested in damaging the world for money, I could have sold drugs or I could make rap music [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=456.96s)]
*  and encourage everyone to stab each other like all the drill artists do. Or you could make [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=460.4s)]
*  controversial statements online that attract a lot of followers who you then direct to your website [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=463.12s)]
*  where they pay to learn how to be like you. Sure. I could make jokes online. Who doesn't? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=468.32s)]
*  I could make a joke online. Are you saying that all the controversial things you've said are jokes? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=474.48s)]
*  No. I'm saying that these organizations and the BBC who are going to sit here and pretend that I [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=477.6s)]
*  am the face of damaging the youth is absolutely garbage. It's completely disingenuous. It makes [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=481.04s)]
*  you money. In fact, I've seen thousands and thousands of comments and have endless emails [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=485.36s)]
*  from women praising the fact that their sons are listening to me. Does it not worry you? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=490.16s)]
*  The things I'm saying. Does it not worry you? You're not concerned about your influence. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=495.6s)]
*  It would worry me if I was genuinely damaging the world, but for you to sit here and say, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Andrew, you've become the most Googled man in the world. You have billions of views and one woman, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=503.04s)]
*  is now saying that her husband is not the same man she wants him to be. When thousands and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=507.12s)]
*  thousands of people are saying the opposite, well then I would say that's- I've presented you with [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=511.44s)]
*  case after case after case with quote after quote after quote of people who are genuinely concerned [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=514.72s)]
*  about the impact you're having and you brush it off as if it's nothing. No. What you have done is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  come here with an agenda. You've come here with loaded questions. You've come here with things [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=523.04s)]
*  taken out of context. You come here with things that you don't understand are satirical. Then [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=526.32s)]
*  you're going to also sit and say that one woman said that her boyfriend changed when he watched [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=530.0s)]
*  one of your videos and then I don't know what you expect me to say to that. Satirical, sarcastic, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=533.68s)]
*  and jokes. That's how you explain the comments you make. Would you like to apologize for any of them? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=538.0s)]
*  For you to sit down and for you to sit down, it's fine. No, it's fine. It's easy. For you to sit down [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=542.88s)]
*  and say that one woman said that her boyfriend watched an Andrew Tate video and now he won't [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=550.16s)]
*  do the dishes. Schools. Whatever your argument is. Schools. Police. I'm somehow the worst, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  most dangerous man in the world because I have a car. It's just disingenuous. If you actually [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  watch the things I say, if you actually watch my comments about women, I've done long podcasts [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=563.52s)]
*  for hours long about females talking about protecting for them, providing for them, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=567.6s)]
*  how I believe a woman should be treated in a relationship. I've done all of this. Andrew [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=570.4s)]
*  Tate talking there to Lucy Williamson. Well, let's go straight to the newsroom, go straight to our [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=574.56s)]
*  education editor, Brandon Jefferies, who's there for us. And Bramman, I know that over the last [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=579.6s)]
*  recent while you've been talking to so many teachers about Andrew Tate. How concerned are they [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  about the stuff he pumps out? Matthew teachers have spoken very vividly of how they are deeply [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=591.04s)]
*  worried about how the language, the attitudes, the behaviors that Andrew Tate models in his content [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=598.88s)]
*  are having a far-reaching influence on boys as young as 10 and 11 and certainly older teenagers. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=606.24s)]
*  That, they say, is translating into a culture where casual sexism is normalized in UK schools, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=612.88s)]
*  where the kind of language that you might hear in some of Andrew Tate's videos are then repeated [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=622.64s)]
*  by children back to teachers and that that, along with other online content, is contributing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=629.6s)]
*  sexual harassment in schools to sexual assaults in schools. In terms of what we were just listening [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=636.24s)]
*  to and what you've just said about concern from teachers, how are they actually combating all of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=644.8s)]
*  that? And in terms of conversations you have with pupils, what sort of proportion roughly know about [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=653.12s)]
*  this sort of content, view this sort of content, are potentially influenced by this sort of content? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=660.56s)]
*  It would be hard to find a teenager in the UK who wasn't aware of Andrew Tate and his content, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  whether or not they've consumed very much of it themselves and some of them will have done. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=673.92s)]
*  He projects this image of success, of fame, of wealth, which very much appeals to some easily [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=678.56s)]
*  influenced young teenage boys and alongside that they are absorbing some of the other language and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=685.92s)]
*  attitudes that he's using. Now schools have genuinely taken a view that they don't want to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=691.76s)]
*  focus too much on him as an individual, but rather their approach is that they try to teach about [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=697.76s)]
*  respectful language and relationships, to try and give some sense of what is normally acceptable [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=704.56s)]
*  in society and to build resilience in children so that they can look at online content, look [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=710.96s)]
*  at videos on different social media platforms and distance themselves enough to make a judgment [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=718.16s)]
*  about whether those are behaviours they should be adopting. But schools say they are fighting an [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=724.0s)]
*  uphill battle against what teenagers can see online and on social media and this is just one part of it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JBhQqqWHY&t=729.04s)]
