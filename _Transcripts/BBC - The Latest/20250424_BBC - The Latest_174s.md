*  People suffering with peanut allergies can train their bodies to overcome the intolerance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to a clinical trial at King's College London and Guy's Hospital. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=5.2s)]
*  The study, the first of its kind, starts by giving tiny doses of peanut powder mixed into [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=9.6s)]
*  food before building up to whole nuts. Here's our health correspondent, Philippa Roxby. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=15.36s)]
*  This could have killed Chris not long ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=21.36s)]
*  The fear kicks in. You know what's coming. You know that you are in for a whole world of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  pain. Chris has had a severe allergy to peanuts since he was a child and 10 years ago he had his [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=30.0s)]
*  worst reaction after eating a curry. I have one bite, put my spoon down because I feel tingling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  and I'm like maybe it's the spice, maybe it's something in there and then within seconds [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=44.08s)]
*  spots start appearing on my lips. That's the first telltale sign. It's like someone's pouring a boiled [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  kettle of water over you for all that time so I'm writhing, screaming and crying, unable to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=57.76s)]
*  escape this pain. The first dose that we gave was 0.8 milligrams which is infinitesimally small. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=64.64s)]
*  Chris took part in this clinical trial. It's the first to test whether adults who are allergic [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=71.52s)]
*  to peanuts can be desensitized. They were given supplies for two weeks wrapped up and then to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=77.2s)]
*  take home to mix with their meals daily and then when they were going to go to the next dose they [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=83.04s)]
*  came into hospital to have that tested with them under medical supervision and then they carried [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=87.68s)]
*  on again on that higher dose then for another two weeks before repeating the cycle coming back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=92.48s)]
*  By the end of the nine-month trial two-thirds of the 21 patients could eat up to five peanuts [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  without reacting. Food immunotherapy is a much newer treatment and really it's only been the last [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  20 years and predominantly in children where this has been studied so we need treatments for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=109.92s)]
*  adults as well as children and that's why this kind of research, this area of research is very [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=115.68s)]
*  important. Patients started on tiny amounts of peanut powder and over many months built up to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=120.64s)]
*  four whole peanuts a day, something they've got to continue to do now. So it wasn't a quick fix [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=126.72s)]
*  and it certainly wasn't a cure. It needed strict medical supervision so not something to try at home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=132.8s)]
*  For Chris it's a huge relief he no longer has to worry about what he's eating [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=140.64s)]
*  or live in fear of dying from an allergic reaction. I'm thankful, gratitude [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=145.6s)]
*  because it's really changed my life. If that can now be brought more widely and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=156.64s)]
*  impact more people's lives like it already has done I think that's a really good thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adAoojD6MA&t=165.35999999999999s)]
