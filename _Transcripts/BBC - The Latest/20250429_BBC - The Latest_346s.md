Video Description: The White House has hit back against a reported plan by Amazon to detail the price impact of President Donald Trump's trade tariffs to its customers, calling it a "hostile" political act.
 
Amazon told the Washington Post it had looked into itemising the costs for customers using Amazon Haul, a low-cost site it launched in the US last year to compete with Shein and Temu.
 
But it denied such a move had been under consideration for its primary e-commerce platform.
 
At a press conference marking the president's 100 days in office, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and claimed it represented "another reason why Americans should buy American".
 
Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.

# White House hits back at Amazonâ€™s 'plan' to show tariff price rises | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE)
*  It's a big day for the Trump administration marking a hundred days in office and they've been busy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=0.0s)]
*  arguably the busiest of any presidency, at least in terms of executive orders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=5.62s)]
*  With the economy and trade taking center stage, of course it's those tariffs and the vast changes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=10.08s)]
*  that President Trump is making to the way America deals with its biggest trading partners and competitors [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  that has stolen the limelight with one word, uncertainty coming to the fore. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson was speaking at the White House a little earlier and he took a question [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=27.02s)]
*  on the impact of that uncertainty on markets. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=31.82s)]
*  I think one thing that has been a little disconcerting for the markets is, you know, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=40.78s)]
*  So he is more concerned about getting the best possible trade deals for the American people. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=45.22s)]
*  You know, we had four years of bad deals for decades of unfair trading and we are going to unwind those [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=51.46s)]
*  and make them fair. What we are doing is we've created a process. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  I think the aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing and as we start moving forward, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=65.42s)]
*  announcing deals, then there will be certainty. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=71.86s)]
*  But, you know, certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=76.1s)]
*  Michelle Flurry is with us in New York. Michelle, it's been anything but a quiet 100 days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=80.86s)]
*  On the 100th day, President Trump accuses one of America's largest companies now of a hostile and political act. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=86.22s)]
*  Their shares fall 2 percent. They then issue a statement denying that claim. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=94.05999999999999s)]
*  What has been going on? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=99.78s)]
*  I mean, exactly as you described it, there was a report from the US newsletter Punchbowl basically suggesting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  that Amazon was considering posting the import duties next to the product's list price. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=109.9s)]
*  This led to sharp criticism from White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=116.7s)]
*  who called it a hostile and political act and said that Amazon was working with Beijing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=121.5s)]
*  Then finally, we got a statement from the company, not directly to the BBC, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=127.14000000000001s)]
*  but other media sources have have been able to get a statement from the company in which they dismissed the report, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  saying that they had never planned to do this on their main site, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  but that they did consider it for their ultra low cost app, something called Amazon Hall, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=142.06s)]
*  where goods sell for under $20. But that was never approved and certainly will not go forward. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=147.66s)]
*  So a bit of a back and forth, but it sends a chilling message. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  And I think it highlights some of the tension we have seen, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=156.45999999999998s)]
*  which exists between the business community and the White House currently, in part driven by Donald Trump's trade agenda. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=159.34s)]
*  And if you look in the case of Amazon, obviously these 145% tariff on goods coming in from China, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=166.34s)]
*  that will have a big impact on many of their sellers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=172.34s)]
*  And Scott Besson, we've seen in that clip, suggests that the tariff chaos reflected on the financial markets was intentional [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  and that it would help secure trade deals. Any evidence that's working? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think, you know, it's we heard that India and Korea might be the first to cross the finish line. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=188.9s)]
*  Obviously, we'll have to wait and see kind of, you know, the fine print on that one. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=194.94s)]
*  But certainly it's been having an impact on the markets. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=198.06s)]
*  If you look at the Dow and the S&P 500 sort of in positive territory at the moment, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=200.42s)]
*  I think, you know, as you reflect back on the first 100 days, I was speaking earlier to Stephen Moore, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=205.3s)]
*  he's a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=210.18s)]
*  He's also an outside adviser to President Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=213.14s)]
*  And I put it to him that, look, these trade policies, you know, there was a lot of euphoria when Trump was elected [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=215.82s)]
*  because of sort of hopes for deregulation and tax cuts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=221.54s)]
*  But now these trade wars are sort of hurting growth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=224.78s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=230.14s)]
*  That's the worry, you know, no question about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=232.66s)]
*  The economy has slowed down in the wake of these tariffs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=234.66s)]
*  A lot of the manufacturing has really come to a standstill as they try to figure out where the tariffs are headed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=238.06s)]
*  and how fast this is going to be resolved. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=244.46s)]
*  I would simply say that, you know, Trump's line is something that I think, you know, a lot of Americans agree with, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=247.94s)]
*  that this is short term pain and there's no question there's been pain, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=254.06s)]
*  but long term better trade deals are in the interest of the United States and every other country. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=257.26s)]
*  But again, if we can reorient our tax system towards, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=262.46s)]
*  higher taxes on things that are produced outside of the United States, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=268.02s)]
*  but lower taxes on things made in the United States, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=271.86s)]
*  that could be something that would be very good for blue collar America. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=275.62s)]
*  And let's not forget, those are the voters who voted Trump into office. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  A lot to cover here, Michelle. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  One of the other things that they said about Amazon that they accused them of doing was partnering with a Chinese arm. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=286.46s)]
*  The message seems to have been over the last 100 days, buy American, snub China. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=294.02s)]
*  Has that been at least the one consistent message? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=298.58s)]
*  It's really a war on China the last 100 days, economic war. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=301.38s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, I think that is the big question is how serious and how much. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=306.98s)]
*  I mean, we know there are lots of conflicting things driving the trade war in terms of their ambitions and their goals. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=313.62s)]
*  But one constant does seem to be sort of the animosity that exists when it comes to China. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=319.26s)]
*  There was talk at one point that maybe these tariffs were going to be used as a wedge to try and drive the rest of the world to come together against China. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=328.5s)]
*  But given that they sort of have alienated allies, it's kind of a curious strategy, which I think many people are still trying to decipher. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvOxz-ma-fE&t=336.85999999999996s)]
