Video Description: At a Nato press conference in the Netherlands, President Trump took a question from Myroslava Petsa from the BBC Ukrainian Service. 
 
She asked whether the US would be supplying Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine. 
 
Trump then asked where she was from and took an interest in her personal situation, asking whether her husband was a soldier in Ukraine, to which she said yes. 
 
"I wish you a lot of luck, I can see this is very upsetting to you and say hello to your husband," he concluded. 
 
Nato leaders have agreed to ramp up defence spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035, following months of pressure from Donald Trump.
 
The US president described the decision, taken at a summit in The Hague, as a "big win for Europe and... Western civilisation".

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY)

*  Engaged with one of the reporters who asked a question [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=5.0s)]

*  Where are you from? I'm from Ukraine [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=14.56s)]
*  Oh, so my question to you is whether or not the US is ready to sell [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=16.76s)]
*  anti-air missile [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=23.48s)]
*  Systems patriot to Ukraine. We know that Russia has been pounding Ukraine really heavily right now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=25.6s)]
*  You're living yourself now in you my husband is there [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=31.66s)]
*  Well, and I can see you're very you know, it's amazing and me with the kids [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=35.120000000000005s)]

*  He's there now. Yeah. Well, that's rough stuff, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=45.88s)]
*  That's tough and you're living here in Warsaw and you're a reporter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=49.72s)]
*  I am good. So let me just tell you they do want to have the anti missile missiles. Okay as they call them [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=54.3s)]
*  the Patriots and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=62.26s)]
*  We're gonna see if we can make some available. You know, they're very hard to get we need them too [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=64.62s)]
*  we were supplying them to Israel and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=69.14s)]
*  They're very effective a hundred percent effective hard to believe how effective and they do want that more than any other thing as you probably know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=71.82s)]
*  That's a very good question. And I wish you a lot of luck. I mean I can see it's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=79.02s)]
*  Very upsetting to you. So [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=83.42s)]
*  Say hello to your husband. Okay. Thank you quite an emotional exchange there between Miroslav Apeksa from BBC Ukrainian Service and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=86.9s)]
*  President Trump's of course [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=95.7s)]
*  We got on the phone for as soon as she came out of this press conference and asked her to come and talk to me about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=96.86s)]
*  that exchange [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=102.18s)]
*  Really overwhelming to me because you know, it's sort of a personal issue that you're not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=104.9s)]
*  You know usually talking about that to politicians [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=110.3s)]
*  Absolutely, and I was not ready to disclose my family situation with him [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=116.5s)]
*  But because he asked I couldn't really lie to him and you know in Ukraine our in Ukraine the army is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=121.98s)]
*  one million strong so [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=129.22s)]
*  so many men are fighting on the front lines and it just [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=132.14s)]
*  Which is the reality is that some of the journalists female journalists have their husbands on the front line and that was my [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=135.58s)]
*  My situation really seemed to resonate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=144.7s)]
*  Can you tell us about not just your husband but your situation in your child as well? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=148.02s)]
*  I have two children actually they were six when when the war the full-scale war broke out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=152.34s)]
*  They were born during the war actually in 2015 [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=158.46s)]
*  Twin daughters and they are right now in war so with my husband's mom the situation is okay with them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=162.06s)]
*  They are in you know, they're secure [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=168.02s)]
*  Everything's fine. They're thriving, but they of course they [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=170.86s)]
*  They are two of millions of Ukrainian children who fled the country because of Russian [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=175.78s)]
*  They're not with their dad they sometimes they see him because now [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=182.9s)]
*  People who are serving in the army can actually go [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=186.7s)]
*  Abroad and see their families that are abroad, but to me [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=190.66s)]
*  It's also very personal because I'm as a journalist. I'm I have to be in my home country [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=194.42s)]
*  I have to be in my homeland. I have to tell the story and it's really [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=199.94s)]
*  Agonizing feeling that I'm not there. I'm not in Ukraine and you have to choose and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=204.38s)]
*  And it's really really hard for me to be in war so [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Hard for me to be in war so the city is nice, but I have to be in Ukraine [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=214.7s)]
*  But I can't because no one can care for my children [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  And you asked a question if you dropped me onto the streets of Kiev right now, and I asked any Ukrainian [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=222.54s)]
*  What do you need they would say? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=227.38s)]
*  Missiles they would say patriot missiles and this is correct because you know today is the morning day in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=229.38s)]
*  Nekro in the city of Nekro [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=236.06s)]
*  18 people died in Russian missile [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=238.66s)]
*  attack and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=242.38s)]
*  Russia has been pounding Ukraine with missile and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=243.82s)]
*  drone attacks lately as never before so many people died in Kiev in all all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=247.66s)]
*  Big cities, and it's really getting this the feeling there's a feeling that it's really getting more dangerous to leave in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=254.34s)]
*  In in all of Ukraine and people are getting desperate and we know from our sources that Ukraine desperately needs more [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=261.34s)]
*  Air defense systems like Patriot at least 10 of them and we know that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=269.17999999999995s)]
*  It's the US who can provide those and the question is whether or not the US is willing to sell them [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=274.05999999999995s)]
*  That's why I asked that question because I know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=280.11999999999995s)]
*  This means life and or death for Ukrainians if there are enough Patriots in Ukraine [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=283.46s)]
*  It means that more people will survive [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=289.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a matter of life and death [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=292.62s)]
*  Marislava said to me and the very last thing that President Trump said to her was to give her husband [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=294.62s)]
*  Who is a soldier the very best she told us she hasn't had a chance to talk to him yet [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  He is busy fighting in Ukraine at the moment [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  But her question to him has already gone viral and really drawing attention to one of the big things that Ukraine needs at the moment [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=306.38000000000005s)]
*  Which is those patriot missiles [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8bVg4EMwrY&t=313.82000000000005s)]
