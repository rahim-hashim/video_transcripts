# Prince Harry tells BBC he wants ‘reconciliation’ with Royal Family | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE)
*  Welcome to BBC News. Now in an exclusive interview with BBC News, Prince Harry has said he is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=0.0s)]
*  devastated about losing his latest legal challenge over the security he receives when he's in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=6.96s)]
*  the UK. The Duke of Sussex's taxpayer-funded protection was downgraded back in 2020 after [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=12.4s)]
*  he stopped being a working royal. Well, he appealed, arguing he was singled out for different, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=19.2s)]
*  unjustified and inferior treatment. But three judges at the Court of Appeal today rejected [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=25.44s)]
*  that appeal. Well, now following that judgment, he's told the BBC that it is currently impossible [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=31.44s)]
*  for him and his family to return to the UK. He's also said that because of the current situation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=37.92s)]
*  his father, the King, isn't speaking to him. Well, Prince Harry is currently living in California [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=44.0s)]
*  where he's been speaking to our correspondent, Nedder Taufik, and we can bring you that extended [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=49.92s)]
*  interview now. Obviously, pretty gutted about the decision. We thought it was going to go our way, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=54.72s)]
*  but it certainly has proven that there was no way to win this through the courts, which someone [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=62.48s)]
*  had told me that beforehand. But yeah, the decision has been a surprise as well as not a surprise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=69.84s)]
*  So yeah, for the time being, it's impossible for me to take my family back to the UK safely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=80.72s)]
*  You're obviously very deeply affected by this. What memories, experiences had you hoped your [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=89.36s)]
*  children, Archie and Lilibet, would have had that you think they won't be able to now with this decision? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=96.72s)]
*  Well, for a start, the only time that I've come back to the UK is, sadly, for funerals or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=104.0s)]
*  court cases with the odd charitable function where I can in between that. I've put myself at risk [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=110.08s)]
*  for that, but I will continue on with a life of public service. So I will always support the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=118.72s)]
*  charities and the people that mean so much to me. I can't see a world in which I would be bringing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=124.64s)]
*  my wife and children back to the UK at this point. And the things that they're going to miss is, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=133.68s)]
*  well, everything. I love my country. I always have done, despite what some people in that country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=140.56s)]
*  have done. So I miss the UK. I miss part of the UK. Of course I do. And I think that it's really [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=148.16s)]
*  quite sad that I won't be able to show my children my homeland. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=157.2s)]
*  And as you say, you've gone back several times during this year's long battle. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  What about the security arrangements that were in place made you feel it would be unsafe for you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  and your family? There's only so much that I can say because of the redaction process and the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=173.04s)]
*  national security matters at hand. But everything. Because in the beginning of 2020, I was scored [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=179.28s)]
*  the highest as far as risk was concerned. And then overnight, I was reduced to the lowest [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=190.8s)]
*  without actually going through the risk management board. So one does question how that is even [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=197.44s)]
*  possible and also the motive behind that at the time. And that was in 2020. And as hard as it is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=203.44000000000003s)]
*  to appreciate or understand why the decision was made the way that it was in 2020, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=210.8s)]
*  the hardest thing for me has been the fix of that decision for the last five years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=218.08s)]
*  The fact that I still haven't had a risk management board assessment done for me over [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=223.12s)]
*  the last five years. Everybody else within this group of people get it at the minimum once a year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=229.92s)]
*  So again, I would not have taken this this far if I didn't have compelling evidence of facts that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=240.16s)]
*  reveal why the decision was made. And I'm sitting here today talking to you where [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  we've lost the appeal, but the other side have won in keeping me unsafe. So again, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=258.56s)]
*  there's a lot of question marks that a lot of people will have. I have all of the truth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=268.48s)]
*  I have all of the knowledge now throughout the legal process. I've uncovered my worst fears. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=272.88s)]
*  My worst fears. And to now know today based on this judgment, that there was no legal framework [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=280.0s)]
*  that constrains the decisions of this body Ravec, which the Royal Household sit on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And I didn't know that until this legal process in 2021. One of the first things my lawyer said to me [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=294.48s)]
*  was as disclosure started, was this process started, she turned around and said, did you know [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  that the Royal Household sat on Ravec and my jaw hit the floor? Well, I want to ask you about that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=305.68s)]
*  because the King's private secretary sits on Ravec now. Do you wish your father had intervened, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=311.52s)]
*  despite how that may have looked? I've never asked him to intervene. I've asked him to step out. I [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=324.64s)]
*  step out of the way and let the experts do their job. This Ravec committee is an expert committee [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=334.72s)]
*  full of professionals plus the Royal Household. And the Royal Household don't have any role in that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  on the Ravec committee other than the helping influence the decisions based on members of the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=346.24s)]
*  Royal Family. And five years later, every single visit that I do back to the UK has to go through [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  the Royal Household. My representative on the Ravec committee still to this day is the Royal [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=361.28s)]
*  Household. That is not a decision that I choose. I am forced to go through the Royal Household [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  and accept that they are putting my best interests forward during these conversations [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=375.84s)]
*  and deliberations. So no, I haven't asked my father to intervene. The whole point of a risk [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  management board, which as I said, everybody else gets, but I haven't never been given since [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=392.32s)]
*  back end of 2019 was the last one that I was given. The whole point of that is to have a board [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=398.32s)]
*  and a risk assessment, a separate board from Ravec that considers all of the facts and all [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=405.68s)]
*  the circumstances. It is a system and an assessment that is designed to be non-biased [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=411.12s)]
*  and to avoid interference. What I know throughout this legal process is the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=419.44s)]
*  interference that was created came from the Royal Household and the Ravec chair at the time, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=426.56s)]
*  who I believe I can talk about because he's no longer there, Sir Richard Motram, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=434.16s)]
*  the first thing he did, or the first people that he went to go and see was the Royal Household [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  at the palace. So whether it's the media or whether it's anybody else that claims that the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  Royal Household and my father and my family don't have any decision-making capabilities on Ravec, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=451.2s)]
*  well then what's their role? They're not experts. What's their role on that? And Sir Richard Motram [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=457.28s)]
*  emailed back in January of 2020 that an RMB would be necessary before taking my security away. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=463.44s)]
*  After his visit to the palace, that RMB that was planned was abandoned in favour of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=472.32s)]
*  alternative governance measures. What the court decided today was that they were justified for [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=479.76s)]
*  reasons to not have that review and a major part of that is because you're no longer a working [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  royal, a change in your status. Do you not accept that from the court? Well my status status [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  hasn't changed. It can't change. I am who I am. I am part of what I'm part of and I can never escape [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=504.0s)]
*  that. My circumstances will always be the same but with a specific answer to the question, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=511.28s)]
*  there are comparisons that exist and again I have to be careful what I say but I think it would be [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=519.36s)]
*  quite shocking for the British public and the public at large to understand or know that, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=527.04s)]
*  in fact many people do know this, that people who leave public office receive lifetime protection. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=532.8s)]
*  Regardless of whether there are threats or risks to them. So for me with a whole list of risks and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=539.6s)]
*  threats that were known about in 2020 and that have only increased over time, including the Al-Qaeda [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=547.52s)]
*  threat that was published and talked about recently, completely disregarded, thrown away, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=552.0s)]
*  ignored because for me security was made conditional on having that official role. That role that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  everybody knows that myself and my wife wish to carry on but was stopped from being able to do [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=567.6s)]
*  that back in 2020. What do you say to those who ask why should the taxpayer pay for your [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=573.6s)]
*  police security if you have your own private security? Where are the gaps there? What's your [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  response to those who say you're getting police protection on a case-by-case basis? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=588.32s)]
*  I tell you why you ask that question again but in three parts if you could because you've just [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=593.52s)]
*  put three very very important questions together and I cannot possibly answer all three of them [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=600.16s)]
*  at the same time. Sure. What do you say to those who ask why the UK taxpayer should pay for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=604.64s)]
*  police security? You have your own private security. Well first off private security can only do so [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  much. Again I can't go into the details of that but I think most people will be able to work that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=619.52s)]
*  out. One of the major things is they don't have jurisdiction in a foreign country or in any country [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=624.72s)]
*  they don't have any jurisdiction. Police protection is effective protection which is what my grandmother [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=629.36s)]
*  made very clear that we needed. With regard to the taxpayer part of it, I don't know if you [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=635.76s)]
*  go into detail how much the royal family costs or how much protection costs or whatever. What I [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=645.76s)]
*  will say is that some of the British press, British tabloid press did a very good job in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=651.28s)]
*  campaigning to have our security removed by quoting figures such as 20 million pounds [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=655.84s)]
*  and through this disclosure process I've seen constituents in the UK write to their MP saying [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=661.36s)]
*  I don't want to as a taxpayer I don't want to pay for for Megan and Harry's security at this cost. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=666.56s)]
*  They're literally quoting headlines from British newspapers. Those figures are obviously grossly [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=672.16s)]
*  exaggerated by about 18-19 times. And further to that, if you know that other people are being [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=679.76s)]
*  protected, people that have made a choice for public office, then why wouldn't you be comfortable, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=691.12s)]
*  happy with someone in my position who's given 35 years service to his country, two tours of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=698.32s)]
*  Afghanistan. And the threats and risks to my life, I was born into this position. I was born [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=704.96s)]
*  into those risks and they've only increased over time along with my marriage to Megan and the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=712.48s)]
*  frenzy across media, mainstream media and social media that that created. So I guess on top of that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=719.2s)]
*  as well probably what people don't know but that is mentioned in the the judgment today, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=727.28s)]
*  Ravec protect private citizens. You know I was made a private citizen by the royal household, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=733.68s)]
*  not by Ravec, by the royal household. I can't be a private citizen. I will never be seen as a [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  private citizen. I will never be treated as a private citizen, not by the media, not by most [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  people and certainly not by anybody that wants to harm me or my wife or our kids. So you know [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=749.12s)]
*  I think once people realize or understand that there are private citizens who have never played [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  any role in public office and never will play any public role, that because they are high risk, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=763.04s)]
*  they are protected at taxpayers expense and rightly so because it would affect not only [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=771.36s)]
*  with that person could they be end up in hospital or worse on UK soil but it comes down to impact [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=778.16s)]
*  and it comes down to the reputational impact of the UK if that person or those people [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=785.52s)]
*  are injured on UK soil but apparently for me that doesn't matter. And just to be absolutely clear, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=790.72s)]
*  what is the difference between the top level security you say you should have and the security [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=796.72s)]
*  you are given on this case by case basis? When you go to the details of the security I can't talk [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=803.52s)]
*  about all I will say is that the last rmb assessment I was given I scored the highest [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  and the only person within the family that scored anywhere near that was my grandmother. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=814.96s)]
*  Overnight I was reduced to the lowest. This case by case basis has been used by the by Ravec and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  also by large sections of the British press to say what's the big problem? You're given something [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=829.2s)]
*  on a case by case basis. Unfortunately that case by case basis is separated by [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=838.08s)]
*  the reason for my visit. Just to give you more context on that, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=844.88s)]
*  it's not really a case by case basis, it's an either or. If you're invited to the UK by your [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=853.44s)]
*  family then we will give you security. If you come for any other reason then you will get [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=859.04s)]
*  a very low amount of security. I'm not going to confirm what that is but it is completely [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=868.08s)]
*  insufficient and somewhere along the line people have talked about the fact that it [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=873.52s)]
*  really all it is is someone on the end of a phone. So no matter how much private security I have [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=879.6s)]
*  around me there's only so much that I can do and operate and function within the UK when it comes to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=885.52s)]
*  supporting my charities, visiting my friends, all of these things. So I've been treated very [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=892.24s)]
*  very very differently to everybody else that exists. All examples that exist, past, present, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=899.84s)]
*  I have been singled out. You've spoken very openly about the fact that you think you've been punished [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=907.28s)]
*  for leaving the monarchy. Who specifically do you think is trying to punish you? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=915.28s)]
*  I don't think that anymore. Now I know that security was used as leverage [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=920.88s)]
*  and I think what really worries me more than anything else about today's decision, depending [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=929.6s)]
*  on what happens next, is that it's set a new precedent that security can be used to control [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=934.64s)]
*  members of the family and effectively what it does is imprison other members of the family from being [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=941.92s)]
*  able to choose a different life. If for me security is conditional on having an official role, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=946.56s)]
*  one that both myself and my wife wish to carry on but then was rejected, not by Ravec, was rejected [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  by the royal household and the result to that is you lose your security. That basically says [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=962.64s)]
*  you can't live outside of their control if you want to be safe. But there's a pretty hard decision [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  there and I think if you strip away all the noise of everything that's been said by other people and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=977.6s)]
*  all the noise that's been created around this, if you strip that all away I think what people will [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  hear is that the only thing that I've been asking for throughout this whole process is safety. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=988.48s)]
*  Both when I was part of the institution and when we left. The important piece here, Neda, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=993.12s)]
*  for me and my wife, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1004.16s)]
*  well I'm not sure how much I'm going to say it but I can never leave the royal family. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1008.88s)]
*  Yeah that is my family, that is my larger family. I left the institution because at the end of the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1017.04s)]
*  day I had to. I didn't leave it in 2020, I left it in 2021 but security was removed in 2020. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1023.2s)]
*  Speaking of your family, your father is ill with cancer. Will you continue to visit him alone [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1031.6s)]
*  without the family? Where does this leave things moving forward? The ability of your children to [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1038.88s)]
*  see their grandfather? Life is a precious thing and I'm acutely aware of the fragility of that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1045.12s)]
*  I can only come to the UK safely if I'm invited. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1055.52s)]
*  And there is a lot of control and ability in my father's hands. Ultimately this whole [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1062.9599999999998s)]
*  thing could be resolved through him. Not necessarily by intervening but by stepping aside, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1073.36s)]
*  allowing the experts to do what is necessary and to carry out an RMB. That said, this all [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1079.28s)]
*  was initiated under a previous government. There is now a new government. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1090.24s)]
*  I have had it described to me once people knew about the facts that this is a good old fashioned [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1094.72s)]
*  establishment stitch up and that's what it feels like. So should Keir Stommer step in? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1101.68s)]
*  I think that based on the judgment that the court has put out today, it clearly states that [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1107.92s)]
*  Ravec aren't constrained by law. Again, I wish somebody had said that from the beginning. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  If they're not constrained by law then this decision was made by the government. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1118.48s)]
*  This decision was made by the law prerogative. Which means that our national security matters, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1122.88s)]
*  my case, which the other side have used national security exclusions and excuses [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  to withhold certain information from me, restrict me from being able to speak about certain things [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1137.04s)]
*  to the public. This national security matter is not bound by any law and that Ravec can abandon [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1142.0s)]
*  the very processes, the very expert processes that exist to protect individuals and the people [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1149.92s)]
*  around them as well as the decision makers themselves from liability if anything should happen. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1155.92s)]
*  So I would ask the prime minister to step in. I would ask Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1164.4s)]
*  to look at this very, very carefully and I would ask her to review Ravec and its members. Because [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  if it is an expert body then what is the royal household's role there if it isn't to influence [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1180.0s)]
*  and decide what they want for the members of their household? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1187.12s)]
*  Do you want the court battle to continue? Do you want to try to see this get to the supreme? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1196.08s)]
*  I don't want any battles to continue. There is way too much suffering and way too much [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1201.68s)]
*  conflict in the world. The heart of it is a family dispute and it makes me really, really sad [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1206.48s)]
*  that we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1212.56s)]
*  in fact I know, to keep us under the roof but then once they realised that that wasn't going to work, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1220.64s)]
*  once they realised that myself, my wife and our kids are happier outside of the institution, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1227.2s)]
*  then please just look at the facts, look at the risks, look at the threat, look at the impact, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1234.56s)]
*  that if anything was to happen to me, my wife or my father's grandchildren, if anything was to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1240.24s)]
*  happen to them, look where the responsibility lies. So there's a duty of care that has been [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1245.92s)]
*  completely thrown out the window and that doesn't feel great. Whether we agree or disagree and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1255.36s)]
*  there's a lot we agree on, there's a lot that we disagree on, but that aside, where is the duty [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  of care? Because as I said, life is precious and it is very clear that from 2020, because I was no [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1271.04s)]
*  longer allowed an official role and because I decided to remove myself eventually from the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1279.76s)]
*  institution, that my life got devalued from the highest score to the lowest score overnight. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1285.44s)]
*  And how does that make you feel given you have expressed numerous times [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1293.68s)]
*  that you do not want history to repeat itself? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1298.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want history to repeat itself. I think there's a lot of other people out there, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1302.56s)]
*  the majority, they also don't want history to repeat itself. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1307.44s)]
*  Through this disclosure process, I've discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1311.76s)]
*  which is pretty dark. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1316.0s)]
*  That's quite a statement. Who do you think that is? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1319.12s)]
*  I'm not going to share it at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1322.0s)]
*  this process. And again, you have to question why wasn't I put through the same risk management [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1326.48s)]
*  board that everybody else was put through, including members of my family. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1332.96s)]
*  And you reject it not because you're no longer a working royal. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  And you reject that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're no longer a working royal. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1342.48s)]
*  Whether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the security needs that I would need. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1346.88s)]
*  Whether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the threats, risks and impact [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1359.68s)]
*  on the reputation of the UK if something was to happen. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  And again, that is proven by all of the examples that exist out there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1368.96s)]
*  So for me, having an official role was conditional on keeping security. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1374.32s)]
*  But for everybody else, people who have chosen this life to enter into public office and then [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  leave, get it for life, regardless of whether they have risk or threat to their name. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1385.84s)]
*  And by the way, I agree with that. I think that is absolutely the right thing to do, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1390.8s)]
*  that if you come in and you serve your country, even if it's a minimum of four years, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  that you get the protection that you require because of your public service. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1399.6s)]
*  I was born into this position. It wasn't a choice. I've served my country for 35 years. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1405.28s)]
*  I believe that I am still continuing to serve my country. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1410.16s)]
*  Public service is my life. That is the dedication that will never change. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1413.6s)]
*  And then all the other bits and pieces that are added to that. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1420.96s)]
*  There are very, very real threats that exist out there. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1425.2s)]
*  Some that are known about, some that have been withheld. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1428.72s)]
*  And for people in power and responsibility of decisions to know that those threats and risks [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1431.76s)]
*  exist, but to turn around and say, well, because you don't have an official role, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1439.52s)]
*  your life doesn't actually matter anymore. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1444.24s)]
*  Well, you can imagine how I feel about that, but you can also imagine, not even imagine, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1446.8s)]
*  that is the most illogical argument in the history of arguments. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1450.96s)]
*  And finally, just because you mentioned your connection to your country, your public service, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1456.08s)]
*  after this years-long battle, do you think your relationship has changed with the UK? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1461.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you feel let down by your country? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a big question. At this point, I'm feeling very let down. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1473.12s)]
*  It's the minority of people, especially those that read the tabloids and the press themselves. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1477.68s)]
*  The press themselves have incited so much hatred towards myself, my wife, and even our children, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1484.64s)]
*  that that's hard to forgive. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1492.16s)]
*  There are decisions that have been made, there are things that have happened [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1497.76s)]
*  since 2016, especially in the last few years. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1501.76s)]
*  There are things that have happened since 2016, especially throughout my whole life, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1504.4s)]
*  but let's just stick to 2016. There are things that have happened that I can now forgive. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1509.1200000000001s)]
*  I have moved past that. I can forgive my family's involvement, my father, my brother, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1512.96s)]
*  and my stepmother. I can forgive the press to a large extent as well for so many things [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1518.4s)]
*  that have happened. What I'm struggling to forgive, and what I will probably always struggle [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1525.44s)]
*  to forgive, is that a decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1530.0s)]
*  and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm's way. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1539.92s)]
*  Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020, and they hoped that me knowing that risk [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1544.88s)]
*  would force us to come back. But then when you realize that that didn't work, do you not want [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1551.52s)]
*  to keep us safe? Whether you're the government, whether you're the Royal Household, whether you're [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1556.96s)]
*  my dad, my family, despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1563.04s)]
*  Again, I'm calling for the Home Secretary and the government to do a review of Ravec, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1570.88s)]
*  and I'm also asking for an R&B assessment that I haven't received since 2019. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1578.72s)]
*  Just because you spoke there about forgiveness, it sounds like the last step to repairing relations [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1583.76s)]
*  with your family is the security issue. 100%. Whatever noise has been created, whatever stories [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1591.12s)]
*  have been written, this has always been the sticking point. Put yourself in my shoes. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1602.7199999999998s)]
*  If you step back to try to create a different role, the same official role, but a different [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1610.64s)]
*  working relationship with the institution that you were born into for the sake of your wife and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1621.0400000000002s)]
*  your own mental health and your child, which now, of course, a lot more has come out because I felt [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1624.88s)]
*  as though it needed to come out. The other side of the story needed to be told. God forbid anything [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1631.52s)]
*  should happen. I don't regret that at all. 2020, when that decision happened, I couldn't believe it. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1636.64s)]
*  I actually couldn't believe it. I thought with all the disagreements and all of the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1646.3200000000002s)]
*  chaos that's happening, the one thing that I could rely on is my family keeping me safe. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1650.64s)]
*  Not only did they decide to remove my security in the UK, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1656.5600000000002s)]
*  but they also signaled to every single government around the world not to protect us. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1660.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  How are you feeling about this decision? Because clearly you have two children, Archie, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1671.44s)]
*  Lilibet. They're not able to see their grandfather, their uncle, their cousins in a way that you feel [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1678.72s)]
*  is safe for them. So what's your feelings moving forward? Is there any way that this could be [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1685.8400000000001s)]
*  resolved? Firstly, I'm devastated. Not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1693.76s)]
*  people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them? Is it a win that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1710.08s)]
*  you know that I don't get the protection that the threats and risks and impact say that I should? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1720.0s)]
*  I would hope they wouldn't consider it a win. I'm sure there's some people out there, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1727.6s)]
*  probably most likely the people that wish me harm consider this a huge win. But you know, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1731.28s)]
*  I've, this is, there are, there have been so many disagreements, differences between me and [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1738.0s)]
*  some of my family. This current situation that has been on now ongoing for five years with regard to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1752.96s)]
*  human life and safety is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left. Of course, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1769.2s)]
*  forgive me for lots of things. But you know, there is, I would love reconciliation with my family. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1773.44s)]
*  With my family. I've always, there's no point in continuing to fight anymore. As I said, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1786.88s)]
*  life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1792.88s)]
*  security stuff. But it would be nice to, it would be nice to reconcile. As I learned through the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1802.4s)]
*  First Nations, throughout Canada, because of the Invictus Games, their goal in life was always [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1810.24s)]
*  truth and reconciliation. And I turned around to them in many conversations, I said, right, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1815.92s)]
*  but reconciliation can't come without truth. Well, I've now found out the truth. I've shared some of [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1820.8000000000002s)]
*  it with you today. A lot of it exists out there, whether people choose to ignore it or not. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1828.24s)]
*  You know, so it would be nice to have that reconciliation part now. If they don't want that, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1834.8000000000002s)]
*  that's entirely up to them. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1843.04s)]
*  And now that this court battle is over, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1844.88s)]
*  do you feel you will be able to approach your father and speak about some of those issues? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1849.76s)]
*  I mean, if, no, I think I don't think he would ever want to talk about it. I think he would just [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  push it aside. And the argument will continue to be this is a government decision. It may well be a [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1860.24s)]
*  government decision. But how did they reach that decision? You know, when the rabbit chair, the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  first place that they went to was the palace to understand what it is that the royal household [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1870.4s)]
*  or what the royal family want for me. I've never ever been allowed or offered to make my own [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1874.4s)]
*  representations, not in 2020 and not for the last five years. And the new rabbit chair continues to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1882.96s)]
*  avoid answering some very specific questions that I have. And one of your previous questions, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1889.76s)]
*  I think is really important is this case by case basis. For me, and only me, there has to be a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1895.76s)]
*  royal obligation in order to receive protection on UK soil. And I think that speaks volumes. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1903.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1eUXtSbJUE&t=1912.32s)]
