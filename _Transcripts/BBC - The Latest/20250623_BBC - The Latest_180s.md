Video Description: At least seven people have been killed and several injured in an overnight Russian missile and drone attack in the Kyiv region, Ukraine's interior minister has said.
 
In a post on social media, Ihor Klymenko said residential areas, hospitals and sports infrastructure had been hit.
 
It comes as the capital is still reeling from overnight Russian attacks last week which left at least 28 people dead and more than 100 injured.
 
That attack was among the biggest on the capital since the start of Russia's full-scale war which began in February 2022.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA)
*  Now, at least seven people have been killed and several injured in an overnight Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=0.0s)]
*  missile and drone attack in the Kiev region. At least six of those who died were in a high-rise [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=6.18s)]
*  building in the capital. Kiev's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said, adding that 19 others were [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  injured in the city. It's also been announced that President Zelensky will be travelling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=18.56s)]
*  to the UK today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=23.22s)]
*  Let's head live to Kiev and our international news reporter, Joel Gunter, who's there. Joel, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=25.7s)]
*  just tell us, what do we know about these latest strikes on the Kiev region? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  Another very, very heavy night of strikes in the Ukrainian capital here in Kiev. As [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  you said, at least seven people known to have been killed in the Kiev region, two more beyond [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine. A very significant attack, dozens more wounded. President Zelensky said this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  morning that more than 350 drones were launched by Russia into Ukraine and 16 missiles. So [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  this was a big wave of attacks. It follows a pattern recently, an increase by Russia [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=66.78s)]
*  in sending these very large waves designed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences, sending [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=72.86s)]
*  thousands of people across the capital and beyond down to shelters for long hours through [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=80.5s)]
*  the night. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=86.14s)]
*  And Joel, as we mentioned there, President Zelensky is visiting the UK today. He'll be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=87.42s)]
*  holding talks with the Prime Minister, Tsikhis Tsaroma. This, of course, ahead of the NATO [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=92.34s)]
*  summit happening in The Hague. A lot of the international attention is focused on developments [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=97.32s)]
*  happening in the Middle East at the moment. But what is Ukraine hoping to come out of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=103.26s)]
*  this summit in terms of its war with Russia? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=108.22s)]
*  So for Ukraine, for President Zelensky, the strikes overnight, the very heavy strikes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=114.3s)]
*  that we saw here last week will underscore the country's desperate need for ongoing military [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=119.02s)]
*  support from its European partners and from the US. That is really the key for Ukraine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=124.82s)]
*  President Zelensky had hoped to meet President Trump last week at the G7 summit. It was a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=132.02s)]
*  highly anticipated bilateral. President Trump left the conference early, meaning that meeting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  was cancelled, which was a blow for Zelensky. As you mentioned, he is in London today meeting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  the Prime Minister. Defense talks will be on the top of the agenda. The UK, a very important [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=149.32s)]
*  defense partner for Ukraine. And again, as you mentioned, the NATO summit upcoming. Now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=156.26s)]
*  we know that President Zelensky is attending. We know that President Trump is attending. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=161.77999999999997s)]
*  What's not clear is whether the two plan to meet. What is clear is that Ukraine really [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=166.26s)]
*  needs ongoing US support for this war. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Joel, thank you. That's the BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_bW_EkIYA&t=175.42s)]
