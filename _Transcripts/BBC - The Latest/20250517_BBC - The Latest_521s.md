Video Description: Ten prisoners, several of them facing murder charges, have escaped from a New Orleans jail after escaping through a toilet wall.

The inmates are thought to have fled around midnight, and were discovered missing during a headcount at 08:30 local time (13:30 GMT) at the Orleans Parish Jail on Friday morning. Three of the 10 have been apprehended as of Friday evening.

"There's no way for anyone to get out of this facility without help," Sheriff Susan Huston said during a news conference.

The sheriff's office posted photos showing how the inmates escaped, which included taunting messages apparently left by the escapees. "To Easy LoL," one message read.

Sheriff Hutson said the inmates escaped after ripping a toilet from the wall and breaking metal bars around a hole in the wall that was used for piping.

# Manhunt for inmates after New Orleans prison escape | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY)
*  A manhunt is continuing in the U.S. city of New Orleans after 10 inmates considered armed and dangerous escaped from a prison there on Friday morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Three of the prisoners now have been apprehended. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  The sheriff's office said the inmates were discovered missing during a routine head count. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=11.4s)]
*  They're believed to have escaped sometime just after midnight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=15.76s)]
*  This is the remarkable footage showing the moment the jailbreak took place after ganking a cell door off its tracks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=19.5s)]
*  The inmates then fled across the interstate highway. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=25.8s)]
*  This is CCTV from inside the prison. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=28.9s)]
*  And the sheriff's office has also released these images showing that the inmates broke through a wall behind a toilet. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  Scrawled on the wall are the words too easy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=37.9s)]
*  LOL. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=41.44s)]
*  Some of the escapees are facing murder charges or other violent charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=42.5s)]
*  The sheriff's office says it's informed some of the alleged victims that the men are on the loose. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=45.9s)]
*  There is a press conference taking place right now in the city of New Orleans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=52.84s)]
*  Officials there briefing the press. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=55.9s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=57.7s)]
*  To ensure the safety of the public who's there in that area as well as those who are working the investigation and the safe and secure apprehension of those who are fugitives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  Each second does count. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=70.2s)]
*  Certainly, the sooner we can apprehend them, the sooner everyone can be rest assured that they are no longer a threat to the public. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=72.34s)]
*  These are violent offenders who escaped. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=79.5s)]
*  And we have to bring them back and they will go to a state prison. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Question from the audience. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=87.3s)]
*  There was a shooting in New Orleans East in Willow recently. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=89.3s)]
*  I believe it might have been an optional area. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=94.6s)]
*  Does that have any connection with this situation currently or was that a separate incident? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=97.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=105.6s)]
*  So it was an event in which there were law enforcement federal partners who were out there actually on surveillance of a target home and completely independent. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=106.6s)]
*  They heard gunfire erupt. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=119.8s)]
*  And when they went to that particular scene, which had nothing to do with this particular investigation, that matter has been dealt with. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  No one has been injured. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=132.6s)]
*  No law enforcement was involved in the exchange of gunfire and it is not connected. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=134.0s)]
*  Last question from the panel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=141.2s)]
*  And what can I say to the public? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=143.2s)]
*  There's still seven people on the run here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=145.4s)]
*  The top is them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=148.2s)]
*  The schools are scared to walk outside. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=149.2s)]
*  You know, kind of a problem to put their mind at ease or are they in any danger just walking around? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  What we can say is that we'll speak to the fact that the people who are fugitives right now are dangerous people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=162.0s)]
*  Is the general public right now should they panic? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=169.9s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=174.6s)]
*  Now, our number one mission, despite anything else right now, is to get these people in custody. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=176.6s)]
*  So I think you can still fully enjoy graduation ceremonies tomorrow, having dinner out, the things that you would normally do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=185.5s)]
*  However, we just ask that you are mindful and you're attentive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=195.5s)]
*  You call us if you think that something is out of order. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=200.1s)]
*  You call us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=204.3s)]
*  Sometimes people think, well, I don't want to call 911. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=205.5s)]
*  What if I am wrong? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=207.9s)]
*  But what if you're right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=209.3s)]
*  And so call us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=211.0s)]
*  But don't don't panic. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=212.5s)]
*  Just simply continue living and enjoying life. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=215.0s)]
*  But just be cautious. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=219.8s)]
*  That's what we have. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=221.3s)]
*  And we're going to keep you updated until every single one of them are accounted for and back in custody. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=222.2s)]
*  So we think that based on the leads we've been getting, these are active and real leads. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=229.7s)]
*  So keep talking to us. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=235.5s)]
*  We need you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=237.3s)]
*  All right. Thank you all for coming out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=238.7s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=239.9s)]
*  We have any further information. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=241.1s)]
*  We'll see that in the form of questions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=242.6s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=246.1s)]
*  That press conference there in New Orleans and Kirkpatrick, the New Orleans chief of police briefing media there describing the seven people who have still who are still on the loose after that breakout of that jail as dangerous fugitives. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=246.7s)]
*  But still telling the public it's not time to panic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=261.1s)]
*  We do have Anna Adams in New Orleans for us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=264.2s)]
*  She's been following this story. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=266.3s)]
*  And of course, we just heard a bit of that press conference there from the New Orleans chief of police police. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  But just bring us up to date with the latest. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, as we heard, a third fugitive has now been found in the east of the city. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=275.5s)]
*  Earlier today, another one was found in a very central neighborhood here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=279.5s)]
*  And another one was found in the French Quarter this morning, which is anyone who's been here will know that is the center of town. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=284.4s)]
*  It is where all of the tourists were. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=290.0s)]
*  And he was apprehended outside of one of the city's most famous hotels at lunchtime. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=291.9s)]
*  So really, it's quite incredible scenes here in the city has been on alert all day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=296.1s)]
*  There have been helicopters that have been drones out in the neighborhoods where the fugitives have were previously living. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  And so there is a sense because this is a small city and the prison is only a short drive outside of the city center. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=306.5s)]
*  There is a sense here that people are on on high alert. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, really incredible scenes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=315.6s)]
*  And I think what's on a lot of people's minds, not only there in New Orleans, but anybody that's been following this story is how could something like this happen? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  Have we heard anything more from the authorities about how this jailbreak actually took place? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=325.6s)]
*  Well, what we've heard is actually incredible. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=331.8s)]
*  And it brings to mind a film really. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=333.9s)]
*  We've seen I don't know if our viewers have seen the pictures of inside the cell, which shows how the prisoners were able to remove a toilet and hack into the wall. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=336.0s)]
*  And all 10 of them get out down the side of the wall that way. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=346.5s)]
*  They then went to the loading bays that are used by delivery men, delivery people. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  They then and this is still on film, crossed the very busy interstate and you can see them in their prison uniforms running out of the jail almost en masse. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=355.7s)]
*  And what is also remarkable is that that video was taken by the prison's cameras, their own cameras at around one o'clock this morning. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=366.6s)]
*  But the prisoners didn't realize the prison wardens didn't realize that anyone was missing to the routine head count at eight thirty this morning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=374.5s)]
*  And that's when they realized that not only 10 people, they thought it was 11 and then they then found one of the people inside of the jail. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's a series of really, really perplexing issues that you could do think. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=391.7s)]
*  How has this been able to happen? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=397.2s)]
*  Not only that, when they found out at eight thirty this morning, it then took till lunchtime to let the public know and the media know by which time these fugitives had been at large for 11 hours. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=398.8s)]
*  So it really is. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=410.3s)]
*  There is begging some serious, serious questions for the sheriff's office. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=411.7s)]
*  Yeah, we've been watching some of that surveillance video there showing those inmates wrenching a door open, running out of the jail. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  And we saw, of course, that picture almost taunting the authorities where they wrote too easy, lol, over a hole in one of the cells in that in that jail. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=422.3s)]
*  You mentioned there seven of them still at large. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=431.8s)]
*  Three inmates are now in custody. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=434.7s)]
*  We heard a bit there from the chief of police and Kirkpatrick kind of calming down the public saying that they're not in danger and yet people should still be mindful. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=437.4s)]
*  Do we have a sense of you mentioned it's a small town, you know, the risk to the public as these people are still loose? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  People are definitely, definitely nervous and some members of the community are definitely scared. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=454.7s)]
*  These are all of these men have been accused of violent crimes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  Several of them have been accused of murder. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=463.7s)]
*  So this is not something to be taken lightly. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=465.7s)]
*  And there was an incredible press conference this afternoon with the sheriff's office, the sheriff in charge of policing and watching the jails. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=468.5s)]
*  Now the sheriff here, Susan Houston has hinted that this was a politically motivated escape. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=477.5s)]
*  She said there were serious questions about why did happen so close to the time when a new sheriff will be elected. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=484.1s)]
*  She said that they'd had help and three of the wardens have since been suspended. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=491.7s)]
*  So really quite remarkable comments coming from the sheriff this afternoon. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=497.6s)]
*  What she hasn't said in which people were asking her repeatedly to do was if she was going to apologize for this happening on her watch. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=503.5s)]
*  Now that's something that she hasn't done. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  And that is what people really want to hear tonight when they're going to bed knowing that seven armed and dangerous fugitives are on the loose in New Orleans. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLOtcjUDbWY&t=511.70000000000005s)]
