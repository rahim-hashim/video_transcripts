# Why private jet popularity in the US is taking off | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU)
*  To luxury air travel now, where younger, larger and longer are the three big trends in the industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to the boss of private jet company, FlexJet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The airline says customers are jumping on board the private jet travel experience [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=9.3s)]
*  and their destinations are getting a whole lot further despite concerns of a slowdown in the US economy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=13.8s)]
*  Earlier, I caught up with the FlexJet CEO, Mike Silvestro. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=19.7s)]
*  This next generation of 40-something men and women aren't waiting 10 or 15 years as their previous generation did to start flying privately. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=24.0s)]
*  They're in on big, mid-sized and super mid-sized airplanes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=34.0s)]
*  They're not starting small and moving their way up over time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=38.0s)]
*  And lastly, they're going far away places. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=41.3s)]
*  They're not just flying one or two hour missions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=44.5s)]
*  They're going to Europe and the Middle East and traversing new places. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=46.6s)]
*  This airplane is Embraer's super mid-sized model. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=51.8s)]
*  So, very, very capable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=55.8s)]
*  So, it's nine passengers, a very big baggage compartment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=58.5s)]
*  This airplane could leave Teterboro here and go nonstop to London. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=62.8s)]
*  And if we do get a slowdown, what kind of effect do you think that would have on demand from your customers? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=66.1s)]
*  If it impacted in a significant way business trends, then I think people might rearrange maybe the frequencies that they travel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=71.5s)]
*  But even during the financial corrections, our business has stayed strong throughout. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=80.3s)]
*  So, over the years, the engines have become lighter and more fuel efficient and more powerful. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=86.8s)]
*  So, that allows you to have a much more efficient propulsion system. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=94.8s)]
*  Which is the largest event that drives private jet flying? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=100.3s)]
*  I would probably say the Masters. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=104.3s)]
*  Just because it's essentially almost a week as opposed to just one day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=106.8s)]
*  So, the traffic in Augusta during Masters week is really unprecedented. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=111.8s)]
*  And we're hearing a lot about pilot and aircraft maintenance technicians shortage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=115.8s)]
*  How are you navigating that and what steps are you taking to ensure that you have enough staffing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=120.3s)]
*  Yeah, we hired over almost 400 pilots last year and we'll do almost the same this year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=125.8s)]
*  We're committed to having the highest paid pilots in private aviation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=130.3s)]
*  What we wanted to do is attract not only competent pilots but also ones that wanted a career and really were embraced the culture here at FlexJet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=134.8s)]
*  And we've seen since we've deployed these strategies our retention rates skyrocket. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=145.3s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the tariffs that President Donald Trump wants to impose and maybe the impact that that could have on global travel? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=150.3s)]
*  Well, yet to be seen. It's so early. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=158.3s)]
*  A lot of the components of this aircraft that we're in were made in the United States. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=161.8s)]
*  And as well as from other parts around the world. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=166.8s)]
*  So I think there's a lot yet to be discovered as to what impact those tariffs might have on anybody's business, specifically ours. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=170.8s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see. And we'll deal with it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpttdN7vWiU&t=180.8s)]
