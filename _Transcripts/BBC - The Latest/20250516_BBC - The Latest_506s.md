Video Description: A man who stabbed and partially blinded novelist Sir Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage has been sentenced to 25 years in prison in the US.

Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year.

The attack left the novelist blind in one eye, damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.

The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.

# Salman Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prison | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk)
*  Hello and welcome to BBC News. Let us start with that breaking news for the last couple of minutes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=0.0s)]
*  The man who stabbed the novelist Salman Rushdie has just been sentenced to 25 years in prison. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=5.0s)]
*  Hadi Mata attacked Mr Rushdie on a New York lecture stage back in 2022. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=12.0s)]
*  In total, he stabbed Rushdie 15 times in the head, neck and torso and it resulted in the novelist losing his eye. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=18.0s)]
*  He is now partially blind. Let me just put the pictures of Salman Rushdie onto the screen and remind you of the background. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=27.0s)]
*  This of course before that attack and it was on August 12th 2022. He was on stage as I was saying. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=35.0s)]
*  And then Hadi Mata rushed the stage and started to attack Salman Rushdie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=42.0s)]
*  He stabbed him multiple times around the face, the neck. He blinded him in one eye. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=50.0s)]
*  We will play just a clip from Salman Rushdie talking to the BBC in a moment or two. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=56.0s)]
*  But eventually Mata was tackled by bystanders. The trial itself was back in February. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=61.0s)]
*  That's when he was found guilty. We've had sentencing in the last few minutes but he was found guilty in February. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=70.0s)]
*  And at the time the prosecution had outlined the case. There was an actual video of the attack itself. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=76.0s)]
*  The defence extraordinarily said that the prosecution had failed to prove that Mata intended to kill Rushdie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=83.0s)]
*  They characterised it as a chaotic, noisy outburst that was rejected by the jury. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=90.0s)]
*  They took simply two hours to return their verdict of guilty of attempted murder, second degree attempted murder. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=97.0s)]
*  So we waited for sentencing. That has come. Let me go through the details of the sentence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=106.0s)]
*  So it's 25 years plus five years post release supervision. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=111.0s)]
*  And for the assault there was seven years plus three years post release. And the sentence is to run concurrently. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=117.0s)]
*  Henry Rees was the moderator on stage. He was also injured and wounded in the attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=125.0s)]
*  And that is part of today's sentencing. It was an absolutely horrific attack. Salman Rushdie thought he was going to die. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=132.0s)]
*  He's written about it. He's given interviews about it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=140.0s)]
*  We'll play you the one he did with the BBC in a moment or two. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=143.0s)]
*  But talked in those moments that he was surrounded by a pool of blood and he thought those were going to be his final moments. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=146.0s)]
*  He thought he was going to die as a result of his injuries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=153.0s)]
*  As I say, only a few months ago, he talked to the BBC's Alan Yentob and he described the moments of the attack. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=157.0s)]
*  And I should just warn you, the description is very graphic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=164.0s)]
*  So if you don't want to hear it, perhaps it's time to look away for a few moments. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=168.0s)]
*  But let's just play what Salman Rushdie said to Alan Yentob. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=172.0s)]
*  I actually thought he'd punched me very hard. I didn't realise there was a knife in his hand. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=176.0s)]
*  And then I saw the blood and I realised there was a weapon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=182.0s)]
*  And then he just started, I think he was just slashing wildly at everything. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=185.0s)]
*  So there was a very big slash here across my neck, as well as the stab wound here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=190.0s)]
*  And there were wounds down the middle of my torso, one, two, three, like that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=195.0s)]
*  And the two on the side over here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=201.0s)]
*  And then there was the wound in my eye, which was quite deep. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=204.0s)]
*  It looked terrible. I mean, it was very distended, swollen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=209.0s)]
*  And it was kind of hanging out of my face, sitting on my cheek like a soft-boiled egg. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=212.0s)]
*  And blind. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=220.0s)]
*  As I say, a really graphic account. Salman Rushdie talking only a few months ago to the BBC. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=224.0s)]
*  Let's go straight to our North America cast member, Jake On, who's following this story. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=230.0s)]
*  And as you got a sense there, and everyone will remember if they've seen the video, this was a horrific, horrific attack, wasn't it? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=234.0s)]
*  Truly a horrific attack. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=243.0s)]
*  And the 25 years in prison, as well as seven years for the assault, which will be served concurrently. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=245.0s)]
*  So he will be serving 25 years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=251.0s)]
*  Now, this is the maximum sentence that a second-degree murder, as well as an assault, can bring. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=254.0s)]
*  So the judge found that this was obviously necessary. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=260.0s)]
*  The prosecution had painted this picture during the trial of a man who was radicalized. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=263.0s)]
*  He had spoken to his father, who was still in Lebanon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=271.0s)]
*  He's a man who subscribed to Hezbollah's ideology, which in the United States they see as a terrorist organization. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=275.0s)]
*  This is the picture that the prosecution had been painting, that he had tried to send money to Hezbollah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=283.0s)]
*  And that he believed that the organization still wanted the death of the author. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=293.0s)]
*  Now, this book, Satanic Verses, was published years before this man was even born. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=299.0s)]
*  He's in his late 20s now. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=305.0s)]
*  The book was published more than 35 years ago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=307.0s)]
*  And he believed that the decree to kill Mr. Rushdie was still valid. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=310.0s)]
*  And then he saw this tweet, and he decided that he's going to go to this speaking event and stab him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=319.0s)]
*  Now, his defense had argued that it was not a premeditated murder, that it was not his intent to kill Mr. Rushdie, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=327.0s)]
*  that the fact that there was no guns or there were no bombs, that it was simply a knife that, you know, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=337.0s)]
*  that Mattar had brought was a sign that it was not, you know, that it was not murder that was in his mind. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=344.0s)]
*  But obviously the jury did not buy that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=352.0s)]
*  And they reached a conclusion pretty quickly, only after two hours, and reached a verdict that he is guilty. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=354.0s)]
*  It was interesting because during the trial, a trauma surgeon actually gave details [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=361.0s)]
*  and actually made the point that Rushdie probably would have died without the immediate medical intervention and assistance he got at the time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=366.0s)]
*  Certainly. I mean, he was stabbed 15 times, including in the neck, in the face, in the stomach. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=374.0s)]
*  And without the quick intervention, he surely would have died. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=381.0s)]
*  And he described in graphic detail that you just heard. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=386.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, there was a pool of blood that was creating a lake under him. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=389.0s)]
*  And he felt that this was this was the moment. Mr. Rushdie, it's this is not the first time that he was under threat. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=394.0s)]
*  Obviously, he after the publication of the book, there was an immediate kind of outrage by some of the people in the Muslim world. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=403.0s)]
*  They were outraged by this book. And the supreme religious leader in Iran called for his death. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=413.0s)]
*  And apparently, Mr. Rushdie was also on the Al Qaeda's hit list. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=420.0s)]
*  So he had to go into hiding for many years and only in recent years when Iran issued saying that, you know, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=426.0s)]
*  they're they're no longer actively seeking for his death, that he started making these public appearances, feeling that he was now safe enough. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=432.0s)]
*  But apparently that was not true. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=440.0s)]
*  A final thought, because I read that federal charges are still outstanding. Is that right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=443.0s)]
*  That's correct. Now, Mata is facing three other federal charges. Now, this trial was on the state level. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=450.0s)]
*  Now, the federal trial is trying to determine whether Mata had sent material support to Hezbollah or had attempted to send material to Hezbollah, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=457.0s)]
*  as well as this attempted killing, which the federal prosecutors see as an act of terrorism that transcends national bounds. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=470.0s)]
*  So he will. He's facing additional charges which may carry additional prison sentence. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=478.0s)]
*  So it may be many years before Mata sees the light. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=485.0s)]
*  Jake Kahn there in Washington, thanks very much for the latest on that breaking story. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=490.0s)]
*  The sentencing just happening in the last 10, 15 minutes with that man, Hadi Mata, sentenced to 25 years in prison. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0A_UzvRjhk&t=496.0s)]
