Video Description: Pope Francis has appeared for an Easter Sunday blessing at the Vatican's St Peter's Square, where celebrations are under way.
 
It had been unknown if the pontiff, 88, would join the service following his discharge from hospital last month, after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.
 
Tens of thousands of Catholics have gathered in Rome for Easter mass during this special jubilee year, which takes place every 25 years and sees millions of pilgrims descend on the city.

*  for several weeks with his condition at one point described as extremely serious but he has been out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  of hospital for a month or so now. He is expected to deliver a blessing now, wasn't even clear whether [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  or not he would make an appearance but for the thousands of people who are in St Peter's Square [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=115.84s)]
*  they will be delighted to see the prompter. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Well the pope is not delivering the traditional urbe at or be benediction, it is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=175.84s)]
*  been given to a colleague to do that given his his ill health recently but we did just hear him [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=193.6s)]
*  deliver a blessing. Let's talk to our correspondent who is live in St Peter's Square for us, Rupert [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=199.6s)]
*  Wingfield Hayes. Rupert, a moment that will be to the delight of thousands of people who are there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=204.08s)]
*  to see the pope in person. Yeah absolutely Samantha you could feel the atmosphere here in St Peter's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=211.84s)]
*  Square change dramatically as the windows opened and as Pope Francis was rolled forward. He looks [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  like he's still in his wheelchair but he was rolled forward to the balcony clapping cheering, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  great anticipation obviously everybody got their phones out and is filming it but there's real [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=231.52s)]
*  excitement to see Pope Francis here today. That's what the faithful who've come here today for the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=235.36s)]
*  Easter ceremony for the Easter mass had wanted to see and he has indeed come to see them and also to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=239.84s)]
*  give a very very short message. He just said dear brothers and sisters happy Easter. You could hear [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=247.44s)]
*  that his voice was very thin, very weak. It's very clear Pope Francis is still extremely weak after [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  this very very serious illness but he clearly wanted to make his presence felt here today [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=258.16s)]
*  so that the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who've gathered here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=263.36s)]
*  will get to see him. And just remind us Rupert of the illness that the pope has been suffering with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  the past few months. Well he he went down with flu in early March it then got worse and it turned [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=273.44000000000005s)]
*  into pneumonia. He was taken to hospital and it then got even worse. He got double pneumonia in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=282.96s)]
*  both lungs and there were moments when he was in hospital when there were real fears for his life. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=288.0s)]
*  It was very very serious. He is 88 years old. He already has one of his lungs was damaged in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=293.44s)]
*  in early life and so he has doesn't have the strongest lungs but he did pull through. He came [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=299.84s)]
*  out of hospital about a month ago and he has been recuperating in the Vatican behind me here and in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  the last week we have seen him making his first public appearances. The first actually major one [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=311.2s)]
*  was meeting King Charles and Queen Camilla when they were in Rome and then he's been doing some [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=315.68s)]
*  other visits in the last week in a wheelchair. Clearly still very weak. Clearly really struggling [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  to be able to speak. Clearly he's he has his lungs are clearly still not in not in a great condition [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=326.64s)]
*  but it's also very clear that Pope Francis wants to be back in public. He wants to be seeing people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=334.0s)]
*  He appeared inside St Peter's Basilica last night to meet people praying on Easter Eve [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=338.96s)]
*  and then here we have seen him on the balcony this morning. And we also found out a short time [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=346.08s)]
*  ago that he's held a private meeting in the past few hours with the US Vice President JD Vance who's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=352.4s)]
*  been in the country for the past few days. Something that the Vice President was very much hopeful for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=358.24s)]
*  but it was doubtful that he would meet have that meeting but he has had it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  He has indeed yes. We heard just about half an hour ago that the US Vice President had had a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=370.56s)]
*  what they call a brief meeting of a few minutes with Pope Francis this morning. Actually while [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=376.64s)]
*  the mass was going on behind me here there was a lot of speculation in the media here as to whether [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=383.84s)]
*  this meeting would or would not take place because we know that Pope Francis has been quite outspoken [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=389.68s)]
*  in his criticism of the Trump administration but at the same time JD Vance is a devout Catholic. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=395.12s)]
*  His Catholic face is clearly very important to him and he clearly wanted to have this meeting [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=400.88s)]
*  and so it has indeed happened this morning a very brief meeting between the Vice President [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=405.76s)]
*  and Pope Francis. Yeah and as we continue to watch these pictures of Pope Francis and his colleagues [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=410.32s)]
*  just explain what's happening out there in St Peter's Square. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=417.04s)]
*  Well we have had about a two-hour mass here it's the Easter mass. This is of course is the high [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=423.44s)]
*  point of the calendar the Christian calendar. This is the the celebration of the resurrection [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=429.12s)]
*  of Jesus Christ of victory of life over death. If you're a Christian believer this is the most [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  important festival of the Christian calendar and that's why it is so important normally for the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=442.24s)]
*  for the Pope to to lead the celebrations here. This is the first time that Pope Francis has not [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  led the celebrations since he was elected Pope so you know it's a big deal and it's clearly a sign of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=452.32s)]
*  of his health issues and now we have come to the end of it really. This is the this is the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  the the benediction this is the blessing of for Easter and then the the ceremonies here will come [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  to a close. Okay Rupert Wingfield Hayes thank you very much for being with us there live in St Peter's Square. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tv5_393NK0&t=469.92s)]
