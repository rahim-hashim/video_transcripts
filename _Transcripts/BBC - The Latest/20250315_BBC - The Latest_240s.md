Video Description: The BBC has heard evidence of atrocities committed by retreating fighters in a battle raging for control of Sudan's capital city Khartoum.
 
The city has been held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since the start of the country's brutal civil war nearly two years ago - but the army has retaken much of it and believes it is on track to seize the rest.
 
Regaining the capital would be a tremendous victory for the military and a turning-point in the war, although by itself would not end the conflict.
 
In recent weeks troops have mostly encircled Khartoum, coming up from the south after surging through central Sudan, and clearing city districts in the north and east, squeezing the remaining RSF fighters into the centre.

Both sides have been accused of war crimes, which they deny. Our correspondent Barbara Plett Usher is in Khartoum, where the army has shown her areas it recently recaptured.

# Inside the battle for control of Sudan's capital city Khartoum | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54)
*  Sudan's war started here in the capital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=0.0s)]
*  Nearly two years of fighting has wrecked the city, brutalized its people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=7.0s)]
*  Now the final battle for Khartoum has begun. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=13.64s)]
*  The armies encircled RSF fighters in the heart of the city. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=18.48s)]
*  After steadily advancing through its outlying neighborhoods. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=24.68s)]
*  Troops are mobilizing, preparing to push for full control. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=29.88s)]
*  It would be a tremendous victory for the army and could be a major turning point in the war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=35.68s)]
*  This district on the city's outskirts has just changed hands. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  But even in areas that look untouched, the terror is fresh. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=46.64s)]
*  We were given the first raw accounts of what happened as the army advanced. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=50.96s)]
*  Asma says one of her friends was dragged into an empty house by RSF soldiers who raped her. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=55.88s)]
*  He told her to come with us at gunpoint and he was beating her with his weapon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=64.04s)]
*  And then we heard shooting and the man ordering her to take it off. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Do this, do that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=72.64s)]
*  Then the fighting around us intensified and we couldn't hear anymore. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=74.44s)]
*  The bullets were falling in the area, so we hid inside the house. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  What's the best thing about the situation for you now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=82.88s)]
*  Security. Security. The best thing is security. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=86.72s)]
*  They tortured us. They tortured us so terribly. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  A block away, things are beginning to feel a bit brighter after very dark days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=101.92s)]
*  Muzammal can smile now, but just weeks ago he was sitting here with his brother and neighbor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=107.4s)]
*  when fleeing RSF fighters ordered them into the house, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=111.92s)]
*  shot them in the back as they entered, killing both of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=115.12s)]
*  The bullet went through Muzammal's leg. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Our friend died instantly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=122.4s)]
*  Then the men wanted to enter the house and my mother tried to hold the door shut, pushing and pushing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=125.0s)]
*  They spotted a phone on the ground, grabbed it and left. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=130.92s)]
*  I went and called the father of my friend so he could come and do first aid, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=134.24s)]
*  but we couldn't rescue him. My brother died the next morning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  It's not only the foot soldiers who are on the run. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=143.12s)]
*  Senior members of the RSF leadership made this affluent Khartoum suburb their home and one of their bases. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=145.8s)]
*  The neighborhood is empty and looted, including the house of the RSF's deputy commander. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=152.8s)]
*  In the wreckage, the debris of wealth and power. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=162.2s)]
*  The RSF elite had embedded itself into Khartoum's establishment before they turned on each other. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=165.4s)]
*  There are other empty houses that were used by RSF commanders, although none as grand as this mansion, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=172.64s)]
*  but it is evidence that the top officials have moved on. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=178.8s)]
*  It's impossible to know for sure, but the army says it believes most of the senior leadership has left the city entirely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=182.56s)]
*  and that those still fighting for the heart of Khartoum are the junior commanders, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  the lower ranking soldiers and possibly foreign fighters. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=191.76s)]
*  Behind them, the RSF forces left a trail of ashes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=199.04s)]
*  They stole everything in Zainab's house and then burned it down, she says. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  This was not a war, she tells me. This was chaos. There was theft. There was robbery. That's it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  The RSF denies committing atrocities and points to similar allegations against the army. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=215.92s)]
*  Survivors are slowly returning to their homes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=222.68s)]
*  The army has the upper hand now, but there is much suffering still to come. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=226.48s)]
*  Barbara Platt-Asher, BBC News, Khartoum. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTIz4EVl54&t=231.88s)]
