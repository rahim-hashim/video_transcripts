Video Description: The UN says no aid has yet been distributed in Gaza despite aid lorries starting to cross the border after an 11-week blockade.

Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, carrying aid including flour, baby food, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical drugs.

But the UN said, despite trucks reaching the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, no aid has been distributed so far.

Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a "basic amount of food" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine.

International pressure on Israel has continued to grow - the UK said it would be suspending trade talks over what it described as Israel's "morally unjustifiable" military escalation in Gaza.

*  Let's cross over live to our Middle East correspondent Yolande Nel who joins us from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=76.88s)]
*  Jerusalem. Yolande, shall we start with where the aid is at the moment? Our understanding [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=81.44s)]
*  is it's crossed over into the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing but it is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=86.86s)]
*  currently stuck there. Do we know why? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  The system requires that once these lorryloads of aid have undergone security checks, they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=97.64s)]
*  just take them through Israel's main crossing, the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. The [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=103.56s)]
*  aid is then offloaded and it requires lorries which are hired by the UN with local drivers [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=109.36s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip to come and pick up that aid. What we have been told is that those [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  UN teams in Gaza waited for hours yesterday but were not given the green light by the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Israeli military to advance and access those supplies to take them off to warehouses and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=129.12s)]
*  to those who really need them. We have been asking for updates this morning but we have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  not heard anything yet from either the UN or from the Israeli military or from the Israeli [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=140.28s)]
*  military body that controls the crossings to indicate what is going on. Of course, there [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=145.32s)]
*  are these big logistical and safety issues. The UN has been highlighting that about picking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=151.76s)]
*  up the aid and distributing it at a time when Israel has been intensifying its military [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=157.9s)]
*  offensive in the Gaza Strip. One of my colleagues who was at this crossing yesterday said that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=163.9s)]
*  they did see heavy bombardment going on not far away from there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=169.26s)]
*  This is what the Israeli army is describing as a large scale offensive in Gaza. What are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  we expecting? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=179.86s)]
*  What we continue to see is Israel bombing parts of the Gaza Strip overnight with more [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=183.9s)]
*  people killed across the Strip, at least 20 of them according to the Hamas-run civil defence. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  In particular, we have seen people fleeing in the past couple of days from the crossing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=199.78s)]
*  after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders telling people to leave there and to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=207.38s)]
*  head westwards towards the coast for their own safety. There is this ground operation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=213.3s)]
*  that is going on in both the north and the southern part of the Strip. We had the Israeli [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=219.34s)]
*  military's chief of staff saying yesterday this coming after all of the international [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=223.74s)]
*  criticism that there had been, basically indicating that Israel's military course is not changing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=230.38000000000002s)]
*  due to the external pressure that there has been and also some domestic criticism too. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=236.58s)]
*  He said that the plan was to expand the manoeuvre in Gaza to destroy the terrorist infrastructure [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=242.38s)]
*  until Hamas is defeated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=248.26s)]
*  Just when it comes to the movement of these people, where are they being moved to? What [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=252.1s)]
*  kind of facilities are there? Is there even a humanitarian area now in Gaza given the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=256.7s)]
*  destruction of the whole Strip? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=261.86s)]
*  What we have seen in both the south of Gaza yesterday from the area, people heading towards [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=267.14s)]
*  Al Mawassi, this was originally set up among these sand dunes on the coast as what the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=273.86s)]
*  Israeli military called a humanitarian zone, although aid agencies have rejected that description. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=280.14s)]
*  At the moment, we are also seeing people who have headed from the eastern part of the north [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  the Gaza Strip westwards also going towards the coast, people setting up their tents along [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=294.3s)]
*  the beach. There are very few facilities in these areas and this coming at a time where [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=299.1s)]
*  already we are told that there are these severe shortages of food, of water in Gaza, of medicines [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=304.74s)]
*  as well. All of that desperately needed and still the struggle going on to get any aid [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=312.86s)]
*  into Gaza after 11 weeks of a total blockade was imposed by Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=318.86s)]
*  As always, thank you very much for bringing us up to date. Yuland now they are joining [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=324.02s)]
*  us live from Jerusalem. Thank you so much. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpo8ba1ghlY&t=327.85999999999996s)]
