# Donald Trump's envoy calls Ukrainian President Zelensky a 'courageous leader' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0)
*  The US envoy to Ukraine has praised President Zelensky as a courageous leader and said they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=0.0s)]
*  had positive discussions in Kiev. The comments posted by Keith Kellogg on X within the last hour [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=5.36s)]
*  come after a turbulent week in US Ukraine and Russia relations. I spoke to the White House [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=11.44s)]
*  reporter for Washington for Politico Daniel Lippmann and he told me whether he thought [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=17.6s)]
*  that the US is taking Mr Trump's criticism of Ukraine seriously or whether ultimately there [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=22.48s)]
*  will be a deal with Mr Zelensky. Well this is what's interesting is that Zelensky was the first [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=28.48s)]
*  person who actually proposed the rare earth mineral deal to Trump and so this is a way for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=34.72s)]
*  him to continue to get military assistance but of course there's people in Ukraine who are saying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=40.08s)]
*  hey this this amounts to reparations and we were not the aggressor but Trump is a very transactional [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=45.28s)]
*  president and so if he thinks he can get something out of Ukraine and it would compensate the US for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  all of the money the billions of dollars we've spent on Ukraine then they will take that. The [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=56.64s)]
*  ironic thing is that a lot of that rare earth is lithium and Trump is against electric cars and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=61.2s)]
*  lithium is a very important element in electric cars so it's a little bit of a dichotomy here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=66.88s)]
*  in that sense. What's the wider political and public reaction been to this very sharp change [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=72.64s)]
*  in position on both Moscow and the US's traditional allies here in Europe and to a degree in the UK [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=78.08s)]
*  is this something that you think has wider support in the Republican Party which obviously many of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=86.96s)]
*  those veteran political members have been through the Cold War? Yeah well the Cold War was a long [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=91.52s)]
*  time ago and so people who are growing up in the Republican Party today they don't have memories [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=98.48s)]
*  of that and so we used to do lots of business with Russia we didn't expect that to change and so I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=103.44s)]
*  think that there is a lot of war fatigue in America given the 20 years we spent in Iraq and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=110.88s)]
*  Afghanistan and the trillions of dollars and thousands of lives and so there is a isolationist [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=116.96s)]
*  tendency in the Republican Party these days. What's ironic is that Mike Walz the national security [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=123.6s)]
*  advisor to Trump and Marco Rubio used to be very pro-Ukraine a few years ago when the war first [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=129.28s)]
*  started and now they are having to toe Trump's line to not get too ahead of their boss and not [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=134.88s)]
*  appear like they're criticizing Trump and so Marco Rubio is now in the position of having to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=142.0s)]
*  reassure the Europeans we're not going to ban in Europe we haven't become allies with Russia [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=147.2s)]
*  but they're still backbiting in the Republican Party with the chairman of the Senate Armed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=152.56s)]
*  Service Committee said that Pete Hedzik the defense secretary was parodying Tucker Carlson [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=156.0s)]
*  and next week we're seeing President Macron of France and Prime Minister Kirstama of the UK [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=161.68s)]
*  coming to DC is there anything that they can offer that will temper Donald Trump's position [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=168.08s)]
*  you know what does the US need from Europe and the UK that they can usefully offer as leverage? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=176.32s)]
*  Well I think what those European leaders are going to be telling Trump is hey we're increasing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=183.36s)]
*  defense spending a lot we will help we'll continue to help Ukraine that you don't want to cut a deal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=187.36s)]
*  that invites Putin to start this war over in a few years after he rearms and so they feel like it's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=194.24s)]
*  very responsible for them to go to Washington to try to convince Trump face to face but of course [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump feels like he was elected on a mandate of stopping this war and he doesn't think that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  spending another few years arming Ukraine is actually going to change the contours of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=211.84s)]
*  deal that it's basically a stalemate and they should just kind of make a deal now to end the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=216.88s)]
*  bloodshed. And when Trump has been talking in recent times about putting out the fires [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=222.24s)]
*  ending these wars and then focusing on China is that seen as being politically naive or is that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=227.6s)]
*  genuinely what he's trying to achieve here and this sort of sense of real haste in trying to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=234.48s)]
*  sort out a deal with Russia and Ukraine? Yeah he wants the positive headlines of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=240.16s)]
*  being a peacemaker he maybe wants to get the Nobel Peace Prize if he ends this war and it doesn't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=246.72s)]
*  restart but this is someone who has also praised President Xi as a strong leader he is a big fan of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=252.4s)]
*  the Chinese president and so for him to focus on China well what does that actually mean in terms [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=261.04s)]
*  of getting results for America and what message does the U.S. abandon in Ukraine if we do that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=267.04s)]
*  send to Taiwan which feel like hey they're next in the line of fire and they're hoping that the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=274.88s)]
*  U.S. would support them if there's ever a Chinese invasion. Daniel Littman there Washington reporter [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=280.72s)]
*  for Politico in the U.S. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIH6AECYot0&t=286.72s)]
