# Can DOOM survive a new generation of gamers? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I)
*  My first experience with Doom is, I'm sure like most everybody else's. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=0.0s)]
*  I grabbed the mouse and keyboard and I typed in a code. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=3.2s)]
*  The first thing you asked was, how do I get endless ammo and all the guns? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And then you just ran around and had a good time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=9.44s)]
*  I'm Marty Stratton. I'm the executive producer of Doom the Dark Ages. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=16.32s)]
*  And I'm Hugo Martin, the game director on Doom the Dark Ages. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=20.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's a classic franchise, means a lot to a lot of people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=22.96s)]
*  It's pretty straightforward. I mean, it's about tons of action, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  always feeling aggressive, moving, you know, on your toes instead of your heels, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=29.76s)]
*  like you might be in other more survival horror games. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  It's unique in that way, you know, the scariest thing in our game is you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=37.2s)]
*  And I think so long as we're doing that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=40.96s)]
*  then it and it feels and it involves shotguns and some form of a chainsaw, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=44.08s)]
*  then it feels like Doom. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=48.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the most well-known franchises in video games. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  If you go all the way back, it's got, you know, the classic versions of Doom and Doom 2 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  from the original team at id here back in 93 and 94. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=58.0s)]
*  And then took a bit of a break and did kind of a more horror themed version in 2004 called Doom 3 [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=62.56s)]
*  and then came back and rebooted the franchise, us working together in Doom 2016, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=70.08s)]
*  and then made Doom Eternal in 2020. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=76.88s)]
*  And then obviously Doom the Dark Ages, each of those really is focused on, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=80.16s)]
*  got it, you know, having its own space. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=84.72s)]
*  Each each one feels very different, but always very doom. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=87.2s)]
*  People kind of say it's a third part of a rebooted trilogy, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=90.96s)]
*  you had the Doom 2016 and then Doom Eternal in 2020. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=94.8s)]
*  What's different this time around? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=97.84s)]
*  It's more grounded, you know, I think that the part of the there's a little bit of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=99.44s)]
*  similarities, obviously, between all the Doom games, there's like a through line [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=105.28s)]
*  and among them is movement as defense movement as offense. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=109.6s)]
*  And I think this time around, we slowed down the projectiles. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=112.64s)]
*  So they sort of form like a maze for the player to weave between. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=116.72s)]
*  And that is very much like the original 1993 Doom was. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=119.76s)]
*  That's where that idea came from. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=123.92s)]
*  And we're still always just studying that game. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=126.56s)]
*  Feel fortunate to be able to make a Doom game. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=129.76s)]
*  We just wanted to live up, you know, to the traditions of the original Doom. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=131.52s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think in that regard, it's very similar. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=135.84s)]
*  And with each game, we've actually been able to really increase the scope and scale [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=140.0s)]
*  of the game in many ways. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=144.56s)]
*  So, you know, for players who've been with us through 2016 and Eternal and now Dark Ages, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  one of the things even on the story and narrative side, you know, we've taken, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=152.16s)]
*  we've said we've taken the story out of the Codex and put it into the cut scene. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=157.2s)]
*  So if you're a player who likes, you know, really incredible set piece, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=161.2s)]
*  cinematics that tell this, again, this kind of summer blockbuster story, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=165.92s)]
*  you know, it doesn't get too deep and emotional at all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  But it is really, really good fun from a cinematic perspective and lots of exploration [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=174.64s)]
*  throughout the game. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  It's a really, really meaty game, much bigger than 2016 or Eternal and just tons of great [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=182.56s)]
*  spaces to explore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  The game takes you to worlds that you've never seen before in a Doom game. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=190.64s)]
*  Rolling back to the medieval setting, that sort of feels like a bit of a departure for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=195.28s)]
*  the series. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=199.6s)]
*  And how did you land on that one? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=200.4s)]
*  Well, it's medieval sci-fi. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=202.72s)]
*  It's kind of our own, you know, fantasy game. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that Doom, you know, stood out from the competition on the shelf. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=206.32s)]
*  We don't want to look exactly like other fantasy games, but the tone is definitely there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=210.32s)]
*  So when we made 2016, we came up with a fiction for the Slayer's Past. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=216.24s)]
*  We were getting a chance to restart the franchise and like most good IPs, usually you want to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=222.0s)]
*  give your heroes a background and a history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=227.44000000000003s)]
*  And if you're fortunate enough and the fans like what you did, then eventually you'll [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=229.52s)]
*  be able to explore that history in a sequel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=232.96s)]
*  And so from the beginning, we wanted to make this game of his time with the Night Sentinels. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=237.44000000000003s)]
*  And we always thought that a medieval Doom would be really fun. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=241.28000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, that's where it comes from, this being a prequel to Doom 2016. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  We get to see him in this setting in his time before we found him on Mars in 2016 and not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=250.32s)]
*  Sarcophagus. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=255.84s)]
*  We don't end with you ending up in the Sarcophagus, but there is some, you know, Easter eggs in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=256.88s)]
*  there, you know, where you can see how it all unfolded. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  This is literally like a game 12 years in the making. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=265.76s)]
*  Yeah, going all the way back to 2016, the stuff, when I say, you know, take the story [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=268.32s)]
*  out of the codex and into the cutscenes, the codex was like this written, you know, lore [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  that existed in Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=279.92s)]
*  And you started to see more of that stuff in actual world building and in the spaces [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=283.36s)]
*  and in some other types of cinematic sequences that we did in Eternal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=290.32s)]
*  But yeah, that kind of medieval flair has always been in, even in those original kind [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=296.08s)]
*  of writings that were in 2016. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=302.48s)]
*  Why is it important for you guys as developers to attract new players to a series like Doom? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=305.36s)]
*  I just, I don't think it's about necessarily new players so much as just making like something [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=311.04s)]
*  that everyone can enjoy that's never not our goal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=316.48s)]
*  Wants to play, yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=319.12s)]
*  Yeah. So it wasn't like even with 2016, we're always just trying to reach as many players [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=319.76s)]
*  as possible. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=325.04s)]
*  And same with Eternal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=326.16s)]
*  So I think, I think the only thing about innovation is that you can reignite interest, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=327.6s)]
*  even in your most hardcore players, because they've, if they love the last one, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=335.04s)]
*  they probably have put a ton of time into it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=340.24s)]
*  So while there may be some, a little bit of a learning curve there, which can be, you know, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  painful, we've gone through this two times now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=348.8s)]
*  We've made, we've innovated two times. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  Like there was concern that 2016 wasn't like the original Doom or even Doom 3. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  And then, so at first there was a lot of, it seems somewhat divisive in the opening month. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  And then once people got used to glory kills and, you know, the fact that there was like [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=362.56s)]
*  a story in Doom, they got more comfortable with it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=367.36s)]
*  And it's not so much where you start as it is where you land. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=370.88s)]
*  And then same with Eternal. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=374.32s)]
*  So, but if we kind of just give them more of the same thing, then I think it's not so [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  much attracting new players, it's actually like, in some cases you run the risk of them, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=380.32s)]
*  your core audience potentially losing interest. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=386.48s)]
*  You know, there's like a game, there are games like Elden Ring that are like turning, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=389.28s)]
*  tipping points for people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  Like I think Elden Ring, not because it's fantasy, but I reference it because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  that was clearly the game that there were a lot of people, you know, standing at the doorway [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=399.11999999999995s)]
*  of the FromSoft games. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  And they felt like they weren't quite ready, you know, but they wanted to because they had [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=406.4s)]
*  heard about it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  And I'm a huge FromSoftware fan. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=411.76s)]
*  And it was clear through the marketing and through the design of the game. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=414.4s)]
*  That this seemed like this was a good time to join in, that this would be their first [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=419.28s)]
*  FromSoft game. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=424.0s)]
*  And or Soulsborne game, I should say. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=425.11999999999995s)]
*  And that's how we think of Dark Ages, because it really is. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that by grounding the combat and setting it in this fantasy world, which we love, again, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=431.44s)]
*  we wanted to do this from the beginning, but like, I think a fantasy setting is inviting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=439.76s)]
*  to a lot of people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=444.32s)]
*  And I think the medieval close quarters combat, all of that sounds appealing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=445.2s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what we're seeing via the response to the marketing content [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=450.0s)]
*  from the very beginning when we announced the game. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=453.36s)]
*  And then, yeah, from the design of the game, too, it's true to Doom. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=455.92s)]
*  It's more grounded. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=459.76s)]
*  I think they think of Doom, the original, as a good, you know, enjoyable shooter that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=460.64s)]
*  really anybody could play. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=466.88s)]
*  I really want to just reassure fans that like, if you want to play the experience the way [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=468.24s)]
*  it was intended, then don't mess with the sliders, but they can be changed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=472.56s)]
*  The difficulty can be altered at any time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=476.16s)]
*  And then also, you could just alter that difficulty at any point in so many different ways using [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=479.2s)]
*  the sliders. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=484.16s)]
*  And that's very much, I think it's even more nuanced than 1993's Doom of typing in a code, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=484.72s)]
*  because maybe you don't want to have all the guns, or maybe you don't want to have unlimited [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=491.04s)]
*  ammo. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=494.96s)]
*  You just want a little more ammo. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=495.52s)]
*  Well, you could do that in this game, you know? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=496.88s)]
*  The audience we serve is that little bit younger, and it feels like there's a bit of a struggle [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=498.96s)]
*  to pull people away from certain titles. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=505.52s)]
*  These, you know, you call the duties, you're Fortnite, even things like Roblox, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=508.8s)]
*  which finally younger gamers are sticking with. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=512.0s)]
*  For those people, what would you say to them to get them to give Doom, the Dark Ages, a try? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=515.36s)]
*  I think it can fit into their, you know, to their gaming habits. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=522.88s)]
*  I think that's the nice thing about a game like Doom is, you know, we know people have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=527.12s)]
*  their kind of forever games, you know, the games that they play every night, or they're [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=533.6s)]
*  playing online with their friends in a social setting. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=538.96s)]
*  We both have kids and have seen that type of behavior. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=542.0s)]
*  But, you know, a game like Doom really can't fit into that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=545.92s)]
*  You can jump in, have a really, really good time on your own terms, you know, have a great, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=549.52s)]
*  you know, fun, again, action-packed summer blockbuster story, and just some really great, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  fun combat, you know, to play Doom. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=562.08s)]
*  It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  You can get in there, play it, have a great time, complete it, have a nice satisfying [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=570.08s)]
*  ending to it, a very cathartic experience throughout, and, you know, enjoy it in the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  course of everything else you're playing and all the other great entertainment options [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=582.0s)]
*  that are out there. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=586.64s)]
*  Expedition 33, you know, is doing so well, one, because it's an amazing game, but two, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=587.76s)]
*  people understand that it has a beginning, end, and end, you know, and it's highly polished [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=593.76s)]
*  and fun, and I think that's a good thing. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=599.76s)]
*  I don't know that, like, every game has to be, nobody thinks this, but, like, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=603.36s)]
*  has to be a live service game. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=607.2s)]
*  There's obviously been a lot to talk about price rises and what have you recently with [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=608.64s)]
*  gaming, and with example of forever games like Fortnite, a lot of those are free, and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=613.28s)]
*  with something like Doom, and there is that tendency to measure value in terms of the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=620.4s)]
*  number of hours you'll get out of something. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=627.68s)]
*  Do you envisage that becoming an issue for developers like yourselves who make these [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  really high quality, kind of, blockbuster type games? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=635.6s)]
*  Ultimately, it's a market, so players will determine what they want to spend. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=639.12s)]
*  We see free to play games, and they're certainly not, they are free to play, but, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=646.48s)]
*  there's a lot of spending happening in a free to play game for a lot of players, way, way, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  way more than the 50, 60, 70 dollars that we're asking for people to play, or people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=656.24s)]
*  to pay for these campaign experiences. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=663.36s)]
*  Do you see it being here in another 30 years, and what do you think it will look like? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's going anywhere. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=669.2s)]
*  I can't imagine, like, you know, entertainment and pop culture without a Doom. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=670.88s)]
*  Yeah, as far as I, who knows? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=675.76s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to look five or ten years ahead in games and know, you know, just know [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=677.92s)]
*  the advancement that we're going to see. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=683.92s)]
*  It's really an exciting time. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=686.0s)]
*  So to think 30 more years of games and technology and, you know, what we're going to be playing [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=688.0s)]
*  and experiencing in that time frame, it's unbelievable. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  But, I mean, I think, you know, like Hugo's saying there, and even talked to earlier, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=697.44s)]
*  looking back, you know, the first thing he did was play, and the team did, was play the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=705.36s)]
*  original games and found just tremendous inspiration for this game. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, you do hope that, you know, in 20 years or 25 years when they're planning [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=714.56s)]
*  Doom, you know, whatever version it is at that point, they're looking back on this [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  stuff and finding similar inspiration. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's just so much, there is so much just great fun in the brand, always has been, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  from the characters to the weapons to just the feel of it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=739.04s)]
*  You know, just the way the game makes you feel when you play it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=743.44s)]
*  Unless something massive changes with humanity or something like that, I would imagine people [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=748.8800000000001s)]
*  still want that, you know, ultimate power fantasy 30 years from now. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=755.12s)]
*  However, that takes shape. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=759.44s)]
*  Doom can still be a part of how that comes together. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=762.08s)]
*  That's the thing, like, when you think about it, it's like, will there ever be a time [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=765.44s)]
*  where people won't want an experience where within, I don't know, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=769.7600000000001s)]
*  there's kind of a limit, like, five to six minutes of the time the game began and you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=774.0s)]
*  press start, you're just going to be a one-man wrecking machine inside of this video game [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=779.44s)]
*  world. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=785.84s)]
*  Like, I think people are always going to want that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=786.24s)]
*  And that's Doom at its core. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWePQOFrj2I&t=788.24s)]
