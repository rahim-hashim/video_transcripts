Video Description: Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his "war" against criminal drug gangs in the country.

He also said he wanted the US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorists, as he has done with some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.

Mr Noboa is hoping to get re-elected in April, and has defined his presidency through a military crackdown on criminal gangs. While murders have fallen slightly, violence remains incredibly high, largely fuelled by drug gangs fighting to control cocaine trafficking routes to places like the US and Europe. 781 homicides were recorded in Ecuador in January alone.

South America Correspondent Ione Wells interviewed him at the presidential palace in Quito.

# US and European armies should join our war on gangs, Ecuador president tells BBC
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk)
*  Donald Trump has recognised some cartels in Mexico, in Venezuela, as terrorist organisations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you want him to do the same to criminal gangs in Ecuador? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=6.4s)]
*  Yes, because I don't consider they are criminal gangs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=10.0s)]
*  They started as criminal gangs, yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=12.96s)]
*  But now they aren't. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=14.88s)]
*  They're groups that have 14 to 15 thousand armed men and women. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=16.48s)]
*  They extort, they transport drugs, human trafficking, organ trafficking, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=21.76s)]
*  illegal mining. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=28.96s)]
*  So it's much more complex groups. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=30.32s)]
*  It's not just a normal gang. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=32.4s)]
*  These are international narco terrorist groups that operate in several countries. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=36.56s)]
*  I would be glad if he considers los lobos, los choneros, tiguerones, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=41.44s)]
*  as terrorist groups because that's what they really are. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=47.28s)]
*  I want to talk about security now as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  This January, Ecuador saw a record number of homicides, 750 in just one month. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Is your iron fist approach to tackling this, militarising the streets and prisons, not working? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=59.04s)]
*  There are cycles. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=65.44s)]
*  There's always additional violence and it's not a coincidence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=67.52s)]
*  Right before an election, there's transnational crime without a transnational security policy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=71.84s)]
*  So I think that's the main issue. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=78.64s)]
*  You've recently announced a partnership with the military contractor Eric Prince to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=82.4s)]
*  help your war on crime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=86.8s)]
*  What is this partnership for? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=88.88s)]
*  Is he going to be bringing mercenaries to Ecuador to help fight violent gangs? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Are these the special forces from abroad that you've said are coming soon? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=95.52s)]
*  He's advising us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=99.84s)]
*  He has experience in this and we're fighting an unconventional war, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  unconventional urban guerrilla war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=106.08s)]
*  He has the experience. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=110.0s)]
*  So you would like to bring in mercenaries from abroad, for example? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=111.44s)]
*  Not necessarily mercenaries. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=114.88s)]
*  We're talking about armies, US, European special forces, Brazilian special forces. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  Our forces initially are low. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=124.24s)]
*  We need to have more soldiers to fight this war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=127.92s)]
*  So your message to the rest of the world in a way is effectively, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=132.48s)]
*  you would like soldiers from other countries to join this fight in Ecuador? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=135.28s)]
*  Yes, to help. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=138.4s)]
*  Like I said, it's a transnational issue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  It's transnational crime. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=142.64s)]
*  And we need international help to fight it here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=144.96s)]
*  Here's the port where the drug exits. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  70% of the world's cocaine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=154.0s)]
*  And we need the help of international forces. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=156.56s)]
*  Just to return to how you're tackling this problem, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=159.12s)]
*  last year there was a lot of scrutiny here in Ecuador [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=161.44s)]
*  because four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=163.44s)]
*  They were later found mutilated and burned. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=167.44s)]
*  The father of two of them told me that the government has done nothing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  What would you say to him? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=175.52s)]
*  Well, we can show what we've done. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=177.28s)]
*  All the military personnel that was involved in that patrol [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=179.52s)]
*  are in jail at this moment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's an ongoing investigation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a trial. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that your armed forces are acting proportionately at all times? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I do think they are acting proportionately. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's also completely unfair for the military in Ecuador. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=197.6s)]
*  It's around 35,000. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=204.24s)]
*  And all these narco terrorist groups together are 40,000. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzFDupm-uk&t=206.72s)]
