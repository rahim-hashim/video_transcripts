Video Description: The White House has defended the US National Weather Service after claims it failed to provide sufficIent warnings about the devastating floods in Texas.   Questions have been raised about whether cuts to the service have undermined its effectiveness.
More than 100 people, among them more than two dozen children, are known to have died after heavy rain caused sudden flash floods in parts of the state.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing:  "Unfortunately, in the wake of this once in a generation natural disaster, we have seen many falsehoods pushed by Democrats such as Senator Chuck Schumer and some members of the media… blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning." She claimed the National Weather Service had done its job, providing precise forecasts and warnings of the impending disaster.
Search efforts are continuing for a fourth day in Texas, with dozens of people still missing.   Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp in the county, confirmed that at least 27 girls and staff had lost their lives, with 10 children and one counsellor still missing.
The White House says President Trump is planning to visit the area this week.

# Linking Texas death toll to cuts in Weather Service is “depraved lie” says White House | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M)
*  It's some of the worst flooding to hit America in a century, and now at least 95 people are known [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=0.0s)]
*  to have died in Texas following torrential rainfall that caused rivers to burst their banks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=5.92s)]
*  Dozens of people are still missing, with the organizers of a girls summer camp saying at [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=12.0s)]
*  least 27 people, most of them children, are among the dead. Two of those confirmed to have died are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=16.48s)]
*  Renee Smarstalla and Sarah Marsh, who were staying at the summer retreat Camp Mystic by the Guadalupe [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  River. It burst its banks around 8am last Friday morning after an entire summer's worth of rain fell [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=32.08s)]
*  in the space of just a few hours. Take a look at this, river levels are normally down here, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=38.96s)]
*  this was at breakfast time, but by around 11am the waters had risen from below 10 feet [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=45.92s)]
*  to more than 29 feet. More rain and tons of debris are hampering the search for those still [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=52.16s)]
*  missing, but there are also stories of survival, as Gary O'Donoghue reports now from Texas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  The sheer ferocity of the flood took everyone by surprise, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  sweeping everything before it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  The rescue has continued to work in challenging conditions, they're still evacuating people with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=74.72s)]
*  local rivers swollen and new flood warnings coming all the time. And now the girls summer camp that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=79.12s)]
*  bore the brunt of the flood on the Guadalupe River has confirmed what many feared. In a statement [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=86.16s)]
*  it said that 27 of its campers and councillors were lost in the waters, they said their hearts [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=92.48s)]
*  were broken as they and their families endured this unimaginable tragedy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=98.56s)]
*  An image circulating online shows the girls staying in the camps bubble in, among those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  confirmed dead are Sarah and Renee pictured here. The BBC has confirmed that six of the girls and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  one of the councillors have died, and there are concerns for the others who are either missing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  or thought to be dead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  From the mountaintops, praise God. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=128.4s)]
*  These girls were the lucky ones rescued from Camp Mystic to be reunited with their families. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, oh my God. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=136.56s)]
*  Some though are still missing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=137.84s)]
*  Nearby two boys who were at another camp were taken to safety on Friday, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=141.36s)]
*  now telling their story of what they endured. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=146.56s)]
*  Someone told me that when they were walking around campgrounds that they saw that cabin five, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  which was the cabin right next to the Brox, their wall had fallen over. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=159.12s)]
*  And my door like flooded away. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  State and local officials say they will continue the search until everyone is found, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=172.08s)]
*  but they're also facing significant questions about whether there were sufficient [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=176.56s)]
*  warning systems in place for such a catastrophic event as this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=180.72s)]
*  There were a number of emergency alerts sent to local residents' phones in the hours before the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=187.12s)]
*  flood by the National Weather Service, most of them coming in the middle of the night. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  But questions still remain about cuts to the NWS and whether they could have contributed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=197.28s)]
*  the loss of life, something the White House was quick to reject. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=211.28s)]
*  Here are the facts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=215.76s)]
*  In the lead up to this tragic natural disaster, the National Weather Service did its job. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Despite unprecedented rainfall, the National Weather Service executed timely and precise [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=222.64s)]
*  forecasts and warnings. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=228.48s)]
*  The rivers in the Hill Country can be wildly unpredictable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  This CCTV footage sped up shows just how quickly the Yanno River overflowed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=234.48s)]
*  This whole area is prone to sudden flash floods like this, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=240.32s)]
*  in this case with tragic and deadly consequences. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=244.0s)]
*  Of course, when President Trump comes here later in the week, Clive, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=251.6s)]
*  he will face some difficult questions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=255.04s)]
*  Firstly, how much money is he going to give Texas to try and recover this? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=257.04s)]
*  He said in the past, don't forget, that states should look after catastrophes like this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=260.88s)]
*  Secondly, what about those cuts to the NWS? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=266.0s)]
*  There have been cuts to the NWS. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=268.8s)]
*  Could they have impacted the numbers of people who died? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=270.88s)]
*  Could they have helped save some of those lives? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwYmEp5k1M&t=274.08000000000004s)]
