Video Description: A judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from placing 2,200 workers at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) on paid leave, hours before it was due to happen.
 
Judge Carl Nichols issued a "limited" temporary restraining order, in response to a last-minute lawsuit filed by two unions trying to save the agency.
 
The order will remain in place for a week, until 14 February at midnight.
 
Trump has argued that USAID, the overseas aid agency, is not a valuable use of taxpayer money and wants to dismantle it. He plans to put nearly all of the agency's 10,000 employees on leave, except 611 workers.

*  For the moment we're going to turn to the United States because a judge in Washington has blocked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=0.0s)]
*  some of President Trump's plans to dismantle America's international aid organization. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=4.4s)]
*  It came after two unions sued the Trump administration which had notified workers [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=9.76s)]
*  that almost all staff at the world's biggest aid donor would be put on leave. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=16.72s)]
*  Reports suggested that USAID staff could be slashed from a force of about 10,000 worldwide [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=21.44s)]
*  to just a few hundred. Now this was the scene on Friday at the organization's headquarters [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=28.32s)]
*  where crews were seen removing the signs. The move is part of President Trump's efforts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=34.08s)]
*  to reshape America's role in foreign aid assistance but the dismantling of USAID [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=39.84s)]
*  is facing intense criticism at home and abroad. Our North America correspondent Peter Bowes reports. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=45.36s)]
*  The dismantling of the world's biggest donor of development aid has already started. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=52.64s)]
*  Signs identifying the agency's Washington headquarters have been removed or covered [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=58.32s)]
*  in black tape but the fate of its almost 10,000 staff remains unclear. A judge has put on hold [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=63.6s)]
*  the Trump administration's plan to put just over 2,000 USAID employees on paid leave while the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=70.8s)]
*  court considers a union lawsuit to try to save the agency. With this ruling it does provide a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=77.44s)]
*  reprieve and it also provides some other relief we hope as well for payments that the US government [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=84.56s)]
*  is due to pay the partners and all of those who have been implementing programs long before January [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  20th. At risk are health and emergency aid programs in around 120 countries including the world's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=99.28s)]

*  assistance. Donald Trump has argued that the agency doesn't represent a valuable use of US [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=113.92s)]
*  taxpayers money. When you look at USAID that's a fraud, the whole thing is a fraud, very little [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=120.0s)]
*  very little being put to good use. Every single line that I look at in terms of events and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=129.84s)]
*  transactions is either corrupt or ridiculous. Opponents say the president's plan is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=137.12s)]
*  unconstitutional arguing that congress is the only entity that can legally dismantle the agency. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=143.52s)]
*  Peter Beaux, BBC News, Los Angeles. Well meanwhile president Trump says he's immediately revoking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=150.64000000000001s)]

*  intelligence briefings. President Trump posted that Mr Biden could not be trusted because of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=163.12s)]
*  alleged problems with his memory. In a reference to the catchphrase of his former reality tv show [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=169.12s)]
*  The Apprentice, Mr Trump said Joe you're fired. Former US presidents traditionally access intelligence [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=174.88s)]
*  briefings though Mr Biden rescinded Mr Trump's after his first term ended. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZo6xWSkwvU&t=182.32s)]
