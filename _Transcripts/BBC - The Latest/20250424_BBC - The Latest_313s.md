Video Description: At least nine people have been killed and more than 80 others injured, including children, in an overnight Russian missile and drone attack on four districts of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, local officials said.
 
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said falling drone wreckage triggered a number of fires, and there are fears that a number of people may be trapped under the rubble of a destroyed residential building.
 
Blasts were also reported in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, which also came under attack. At least two people were injured, the mayor said.
 
The Russian attacks came hours after US President Donald Trump accused Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations.

*  behind me this is a residential neighborhood about 15 minutes from the center of Kyiv where [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=114.96s)]
*  one of the ballistic missiles struck and all the buildings here have had their windows blown out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=120.32s)]
*  the balcony's ripped apart and just to the other side it's been cordoned off you can see where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=125.28s)]
*  a whole apartment block has been completely flattened and that's where we think the nine [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=130.4s)]
*  people were killed we've still got the emergency services on the scene going through the rubble [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=135.12s)]
*  they think there are people possibly still buried trapped underneath and a lot of people here [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=140.4s)]
*  obviously incredibly upset I just spoke to one middle-aged woman who had actually fled her home [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=145.36s)]
*  in the very east of Ukraine which is now occupied by Russia she'd come to Kyiv her house has now been [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=151.44s)]
*  badly damaged she said she woke up at 1 30 in the morning managed to make it into the corridor [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=157.84s)]
*  but was absolutely terrified yeah we can see the the remnants behind you that clear up operation [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=162.96s)]
*  John just in terms of the operation in dealing with trying to get some form of C-SPY agreement [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=169.28s)]
*  of course the US is putting a lot of pressure on Ukraine but we're hearing Ukrainians foreign [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=176.24s)]
*  minister saying that these deadly strikes on Kyiv show that it is Russia that is maintaining this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=180.24s)]
*  war yes he has said that it shows that Russia does not want to pursue peace and the truth is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=187.28s)]
*  that the Ukrainians say look before we can have any sort of talk about territorial exchanges a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=198.08s)]
*  long-term peace we've got to have a ceasefire and that is clearly is not happening now you get the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=204.8s)]
*  sense of real urgency and impatience from Donald Trump who we heard from earlier but I think the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  reality is that on the ground the two sides remain very far apart and the kind of compromises [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=218.0s)]
*  that are going to be needed to get some sort of deal I just don't see that the two sides are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=224.8s)]
*  ready to make them particularly the Russians who do not really be seen to be being asked to make [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=230.4s)]
*  any compromises by the United States John and just in terms of the clear up operation behind [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=236.32s)]
*  you of course we're seeing that ongoing people absolutely devastated they're following these [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  huge strikes overnight against Kyiv just in terms of the morale of people there of course we know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=249.2s)]
*  that this war has been gruelling for Ukrainians just talk us through what people are telling you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  John. Well lots of people here incredibly upset presumably we've got what dozens scores of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=260.64s)]
*  families who are now going to be homeless at least temporarily just in this neighborhood I saw one [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=268.32s)]
*  man emerging an elderly gentleman completely bloodied and bandaged another elderly woman just [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=274.8s)]
*  sobbing in the park behind where we are at the moment the lady I spoke to from the east earlier [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=280.32s)]
*  I said to her you know would she does she think president Zelensky should give up [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=286.56s)]
*  Ukrainian territory in the east in order to secure a peace deal Ukrainian territory that is her [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=293.76s)]
*  homeland and she was absolutely adamant she said no he should not Ukraine's territorial [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=299.2s)]
*  integrity should not be up for discussion so I think you know the mood is one of continued resilience. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ExJMYTwrU&t=306.64s)]
