# Israel launches major Gaza offensive to 'seize and control' areas | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q)
*  For the latest now on the Israel-Gaza war, Israel has begun a new offensive aimed at taking control [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  of parts of Gaza. The military said it had carried out extensive strikes and was mobilising troops. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=5.44s)]
*  Israel also dropped leaflets across northern Gaza telling Palestinians to leave the area. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=12.08s)]
*  On Friday, 100 people were killed in northern Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  with more than 250 people killed since Thursday morning. It marks the largest ground assault [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=23.759999999999998s)]
*  on northern Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in March. The IDF says it struck what it called [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=30.88s)]
*  more than 150 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=37.36s)]
*  the United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Turk has condemned Israel for its escalating bombardments [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=44.8s)]
*  of Gaza, saying it's apparently seeking to permanently displace the population and that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=51.44s)]
*  this amounts to ethnic cleansing. Our correspondent, Wirah Davis, is in Jerusalem with the latest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise this has been threatened, this has been promised by the Israeli Prime [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this enhanced, advanced military push into Gaza would happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  What we've seen all week actually is steadily increasing Israeli military activity in Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=74.88s)]
*  That culminated in Friday and the biggest military operation we've seen for a couple of months now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=80.24s)]
*  That was an assault from sea land and there in northern Gaza and overnight the IDF, the Israeli [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=86.32s)]
*  military, has said that Operation Gideon's Chariots, as it's been called, is now basically [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  underway and that is part of a push which involves thousands of Israeli reservists as well as regular [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=98.88s)]
*  soldiers planning to go into Gaza, to occupy much of Gaza and remain there and to push much [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=105.36s)]
*  of the Gaza population towards the south of the territory. The goal, says Israel, is to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=112.0s)]
*  finally defeat Hamas once and for all and to secure the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=118.48s)]
*  But it's been much criticized, not just here in Israel, because of course the concerns about what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=124.16s)]
*  that might mean for the remaining hostages but also by many governments around the region and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=129.84s)]
*  around the world insofar also as the humanitarian crisis as we know in Gaza is steadily worsening. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  So the latest reports we've had this morning are that Israeli military operations on the ground [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=142.24s)]
*  are happening in central Gaza around Dira al-Bala, according to reports from Gaza's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=147.12s)]
*  civil defense agency. There have been several deaths this morning in Israeli airstrikes. So [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=153.04s)]
*  at least 250 people killed over the last couple of days as this operation, Gideon's Chariots, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=158.8s)]
*  gets underway. You mentioned the aid situation. There were these reports of an alternative US [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=164.4s)]
*  back proposal to deliver aid to Gaza and I found it quite interesting that President Trump in an [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=169.44s)]
*  interview with Fox News even saying that a lot of people are starving. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=174.56s)]
*  Yeah, well look, Israel is coming under increasing pressure from its allies, governments around the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=180.96s)]
*  region, to lift this embargo, this blockade that has been in place now for more than 10 weeks. No [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=186.88s)]
*  food, no fuel, no medicines have been allowed in. There is an impending famine, says the UN in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=193.84s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people are facing starvation because of the lack of food and there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  is pressure not just from the UN but from governments like the US. Donald Trump said last night a lot of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=206.88s)]
*  people are starving, it has to be taken care of. The American Secretary of State Marco Rubio said [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=213.6s)]
*  he was troubled by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The UN says it's ready. It has tens of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=219.68s)]
*  thousands of tons of aid waiting on the border to go in and to be distributed but Israel has, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  according to many in the Israeli government, lost confidence in the UN and it's trying to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=231.68s)]
*  organize a separate mechanism, an American-backed private initiative to get aid in but the UN says [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=236.0s)]
*  what is the point? Those people don't have the facilities on the ground that we do. Let the UN [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=242.48s)]
*  take care of this, let the World Food Programme, let the World Health Organization take care of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  this. They're ready and happy to do it but thus far Israel has been resisting those calls to allow [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=252.32s)]
*  aid in and to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. There was, I know it was, faint hope with Donald [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=259.2s)]
*  Trump in the region that there may be some progress on the ceasefire talks. That hope has gone away [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=265.2s)]
*  now. It hasn't been completely extinguished. My understanding is that Israeli negotiators remained [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=272.32s)]
*  in Doha overnight but you're right, Donald Trump has left the region. The understanding was that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=279.76s)]
*  this new ceasefire proposal, the Witkoff Plan, would only really be on the table for the duration [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=284.88s)]
*  of Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East. There are elements of the plan which aren't agreeable [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  either to Hamas or to the Israelis and all of the noises we're getting through back channels [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=296.0s)]
*  are that there's been no progress at all in the ceasefire talks. In many ways it's a tragedy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=300.8s)]
*  because in the previous ceasefire dozens of Israeli hostages were released, hundreds of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians were freed from Israeli jails, aid was getting back into the Gaza Strip and people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  were allowed to move back towards their home areas. Then that process was abandoned by the Israelis, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=316.72s)]
*  the hostilities resumed and we are where we are now with no real hopes of the ceasefire resuming [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  and the resumption or the start of this Operation Gideon's Chariots, this big Israeli military [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=329.28s)]
*  offensive in Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIarhD3X-Q&t=335.52s)]
