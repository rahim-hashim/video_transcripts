**BBC - The Latest:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts)
*  Is it still safe to get on a plane? Well what if I told you it was actually far safer to fly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=0.0s)]
*  than it is to drive? You'll probably be aware there have been a few high profile plane crashes [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=4.32s)]
*  recently including this collision in Washington DC and this crash landing in Toronto. One recent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=8.16s)]
*  survey suggests that people in the US are becoming less confident about flying because of images like [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=12.72s)]
*  these but is it becoming more dangerous to fly? Well short answer no. BBC Verifies analysed the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=17.12s)]
*  data and found no evidence of an upward trend in air accidents over the past 20 years. Here an [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=21.84s)]
*  accident can mean a major crash that results in death or more minor incidents like when an aircraft [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=26.72s)]
*  is damaged and needs repairs. Either way the number of accidents hasn't risen in fact it's gone down. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=31.04s)]
*  This downward global trend is also the case in America over the past two decades. Air crash deaths [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=35.84s)]
*  have been falling although when there's a major disaster you'll see a spike in the data for the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=40.24s)]
*  number of fatalities. By far the most transport related deaths in America happen on the road [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=44.16s)]
*  not in the air so statistically speaking the most dangerous part about taking a flight is the drive [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=48.72s)]
*  to the airport. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UohM7i5w0ts&t=53.44s)]
