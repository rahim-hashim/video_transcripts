Video Description: Thirty-seven people have been brought ashore after a cargo vessel collided with an oil tanker off the east coast of England.

One person is in hospital while the other 36 mariners from both crews are "safe and accounted for", says local MP Graham Stuart.

Jet fuel is spilling into the North Sea following the collision off the East Yorkshire coast, the owner of the tanker says.

The US-flagged Stena Immaculate appears to have been hit while at anchor by the Portuguese-flagged container Solong, according to tracking data analysed by BBC Verify.

# Jet fuel spills into North Sea after tanker collision | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8)
*  Major rescue operation is currently underway in the North Sea after an oil tanker and a cargo vessel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Collided this morning off the coast of Hull [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=6.42s)]
*  These pictures that were sent to the BBC show smoke billowing from both ships [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=9.06s)]
*  The American flagged tanker is the Stenner immaculate on the tracking side [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=13.26s)]
*  It was seemingly at anchor outside hull when it was hit by the Salong a Portuguese flagged container [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=18.0s)]
*  That was heading south from the Scottish port of Grangemouth towards Rotterdam [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=24.84s)]
*  In the Netherlands the chief executive of the port of Grimsby East was told there was a massive fireball after the collision [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=30.04s)]
*  Reports of people abandoning ship lifeboats and firefighting teams quickly dispatched to the scene more than 30 casualties [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=36.88s)]
*  Have so far been brought ashore at Grimsby the Coast Guard rescue helicopter was scrambled from Humberside alongside lifeboats from Skegness [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Bridlington maplestorp and cleethorpes. This is the map of the location [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  The collision site is around 20 kilometers off the coast there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=56.98s)]
*  And if we switch to this map from marine traffic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=60.28s)]
*  Then you will see that at the time there were a lot of ships in that area as you would fully expect on any given day [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=62.98s)]
*  There is a lot of shipping that comes in and out of the Humber estuary and the container port in Hull [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  So an obvious question why was more care not being taken? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=73.5s)]
*  Let's speak to our reporter Rowan bridge who's just arrived in Grimsby for his let's start with the rescue Rowan [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=78.02s)]
*  What do we know about the crews on board? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=83.22s)]
*  Yes, well we know there's at least 32 people have been brought ashore following that collision [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=87.46s)]
*  They have been brought through the port here in Grimsby where I am [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=92.7s)]
*  But the condition of some of those is not yet known [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=96.42s)]
*  We know that at least 20 people who are on board the tanker have all been accounted for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=98.78s)]
*  But the condition of the others brought ashore isn't clear at the moment [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=103.78s)]
*  We have seen ambulances and emergency services turning up here presumably ferrying people to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=107.86s)]
*  Hospital whether that be Grimsby or to Hull or perhaps potentially further afield depending on how serious their injuries are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=113.42s)]
*  I mean if you saw some of the footage as you said in your introduction there were reports of a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=120.1s)]
*  Massive fireball at sea and then video footage you can see black smoke billowing from the oil tanker [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=125.18s)]
*  But what's not clear is exactly how people were able to get off there and how seriously injured before [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=131.82s)]
*  They managed to get off the ship they may be or indeed who there is who may yet still be to be accounted for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=137.62s)]
*  It seems a fair day behind you Rowan. Do we know what conditions were like out at sea? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=144.66s)]
*  No, I mean that's still one of those things that's going to be investigated [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=151.58s)]
*  As you say Christian at the time this happened one of the vessels was as anchor [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=154.46s)]
*  It had traveled from Greece up towards the port of Hull and was anchored off the coast of East Yorkshire here when it was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=159.12s)]
*  struck by the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=165.42s)]
*  Cargo vessel now what's not clear is why that could happen in in daylight conditions today? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=166.98s)]
*  They this was reported as about 10 to 10 this morning, so it would have been daylight [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=173.82s)]
*  What's not clear is what led to those circumstances which allowed that condition that collision to happen the other thing which isn't clear at the moment [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  We're still trying to establish is what was on board those two vessels at the time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  What was on board that oil tanker and what might the implications be of that clearly that vessel is on fire [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  But exactly what was on board at the time and what the implications of any spill from that vessel might be is still unclear [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=196.3s)]
*  at the moment the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  Investigation branch have arrived here. They are starting preliminary investigations the marine accident investigation branch have begun their preliminary investigations into what happens here [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  But we are still very much in the early stages of this as you might gather Rowan. Thank you very much for that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  Let's check in with our reporter Phil McCann. He's been following the live events and the reaction to it [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about these two ships if you would feel what do we know about them? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=224.26s)]
*  Well just following on Christian from what Rowan was saying there in terms of what the oil tanker was carrying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  We have actually in the last few moments had an update from the US logistics firm Crowley [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=233.82s)]
*  That is the operator and also the joint owner of the MV Stenner immaculate. That's the oil tanker here and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=239.48s)]
*  It says that it was carrying jet fuel when it was hit by the container ships along in the North Sea [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=246.78s)]
*  This morning, so not crude oil but jet fuel [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=254.18s)]
*  The hope of course will be that that is the kind of fuel that can dissipate as opposed to the kind of oil that can [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  Cause huge environmental damage, especially on coastlines [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=263.38s)]
*  Significantly, they've also said that all of the ship's crew of more than 20 are safe and accounted for but they say jet [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=267.14s)]
*  Fuel is pouring into the sea [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=275.06s)]
*  They've given us a statement which continues a fire occurred as a result of the collision fuel is reported released [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=277.54s)]
*  The Stenner immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions on board giving a very dramatic account of what happened [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=283.66s)]
*  All Crowley mariners are safe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=290.62s)]
*  They say and fully accounted for now the BBC understands that the fuel on board this ship [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  Was owned by the US government which is consistent with the fact that we know [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=297.66s)]
*  That vessel was part of an arrangement with others a US government arrangement [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Which is designed to supply the US armed forces with fuel during times of armed conflict or of national emergency [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=309.2s)]
*  And just to be clear, of course, we know that there are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  American Air Force bases in several parts of the UK [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=318.67999999999995s)]
*  We don't necessarily know that that was the reason that that ship was delivering fuel at that point in time [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  We do know now that it was the US government which owned the fuel on board as for the other ship involved here [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=328.44s)]
*  Of course the salon we haven't had confirmation yet from its owners or operators as to exactly how many people were on board [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  We know that it was 32 people who have so far been reported to have been rescued and brought ashore [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=341.12s)]
*  At Grimsby and also no detail from them as to exactly what happened to cause this collision [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  No, but as I mentioned Phil there was quite a lot of traffic in and around [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=354.48s)]
*  The the outskirts of the Humber estuary as you would expect on on any given day [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=359.48s)]
*  So the question is why was was the approaching ship not taking more care? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=365.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely because we know [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=370.92s)]
*  It seems that we know exactly what happened here from tracking data. I say what happened not why it happened [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=373.0s)]
*  We know that the oil tanker was at anchor [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=378.52s)]
*  It was effectively stopped in the North Sea and the salon was coming from [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=381.5s)]
*  The port of grains mouth in Scotland going across to Rotterdam and it hit [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=387.26s)]
*  The oil tanker pretty much head-on and you mentioned this is a very busy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=392.5s)]
*  Well, there are very busy shipping lanes in this area [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=398.46s)]
*  That part of the North Sea is an area which nowadays has an awful lot of wind turbines in it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=401.06s)]
*  There are lots of ships that have to service those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=405.42s)]
*  Wind turbines indeed we know that that's around 10 to 10 this morning when this collision occurred [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=407.94s)]
*  There was effectively a Mayday call put out so that you had the Coast Guard ships responding and the lifeboat [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=413.62s)]
*  The RNLI lifeboats responding but you also had a call put out to other ships that were in the area just to come over [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  To see if they could help especially if they had firefighting [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=427.74s)]
*  capabilities on board [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=431.74s)]
*  Phil thank you for that we've got with us our climate and science reporter as me stallard an important detail that Phil's just given us [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=433.86s)]
*  There as me that there was jet fuel on board. How do you if you are the government? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=440.18s)]
*  How do you go about securing the cargo that's on board? And what is the significance of jet fuel over crude oil say? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=445.62s)]
*  Yeah, of course [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=453.18s)]
*  So as she said what's very important here is the type of fuel that's on board and that's because they behave in different ways [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=454.1s)]
*  So sometimes when we think of oil spills potentially images of black [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=459.92s)]
*  Bers covered in sort of this black oil or all the sea covered in it spring to mind. That is crude oil [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not what we're dealing with here [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=470.12s)]
*  And that's important because they dissipate differently as we've just heard so jet oil [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=471.68s)]
*  Kerosene can evaporate very quickly [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  Which means it doesn't hang around in the environment for as long [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  But that's not to say that it doesn't potentially pose harm to the natural environment [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=482.56s)]
*  And that's because the fumes can be quite toxic. So on a small scale [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=487.2s)]
*  We're not expecting it to potentially kill fish [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=491.52s)]
*  But obviously that this could be quite a significant spill and as that enters the water column it can be toxic to aquatic organisms [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=493.52s)]
*  There's also concern obviously for nearby nature reserves if it was to wash up and actually we've had a statement in the last few [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=500.64s)]
*  Minutes from the RSPB. I'm just gonna read you elements of it here Dave Ohara [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=507.38s)]
*  Who's a senior site manager RSPB Benpton Cliffs [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=511.2s)]
*  Which is a nearby nature reserve said as details continue to emerge our first thoughts are for the safety of everyone on board [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=514.2s)]
*  But this incident is close to Benpton Cliffs home to the biggest Gannett colony in England [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  Naturally, we are extremely concerned about the potential of a leak from the tanker now [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=526.0s)]
*  There's obviously been a very quick response as we've seen from the UK Coast Guard and they said to us as part of that response [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=530.94s)]
*  They're also looking at counter pollution [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=537.2s)]
*  To try and prevent that oil [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=540.2s)]
*  Dissipating too far into the sea but one thing to point out about jet a one fuel or kerosene is that it is very very [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=542.2s)]
*  Difficult to see it will be a sheen like look on the surface [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=550.08s)]
*  It won't be as I mentioned like crude oil [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=553.72s)]
*  It won't be thick and black which could potentially make the cleanup operation fairly difficult [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but obviously huge anxiety for communities in Grimsby Scarborough [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  Clea thought big fishing communities who fish that area of the North Sea and not particularly far off coast [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. We've already heard there from the local authorities that locals have raised their concerns with them about the potential environmental [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=571.1s)]
*  Impact and you know, the UK is no stranger to oil disasters [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=578.6600000000001s)]
*  Some people might remember one of the worst environmental disasters this country has seen was back in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=582.6s)]
*  1967 when the SS Tory Canyon ran a ground in Cornwall and spilled a hundred thousand tons of in that case crude oil [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  Which obviously as I said behaves differently [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  but that will be in the memories of people that in that case thousands of fish were killed and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=597.14s)]
*  Obviously efforts will be taken as I said by the UK Coast Guard [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  But also likely working with some of these environmental organizations such as the RSPB [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=605.6s)]
*  Local fishermen and communities to make sure that the impact on the natural environment is minimized as far as possible [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  Government says they are sending crews to to try and limit the spill [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=618.88s)]
*  Obviously we were just talking to Rowan about this that the weather will be important [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=623.38s)]
*  Will it not it absolutely will be so at the moment as we've seen in some of the pictures there is a massive fire [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=627.38s)]
*  So obviously that will restrict access in how close some of those crews get to the site of a potential oil spill [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=633.84s)]
*  But as you mentioned both the sea conditions and the weather conditions will affect where a spill may move to so if we're getting [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=640.84s)]
*  Winds that could blow that further south and of course they'll be looking at that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=648.24s)]
*  They'll be assessing some of the movement of that and the tools that they can use also include satellite imagery [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=652.64s)]
*  And they can pick up potentially where that is spreading as well as looking at other signatures of the oil [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  It's really useful stuff. Thank you for that as me. Let's keep our fingers crossed on those weather conditions [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=664.32s)]
*  And here's Mike Ross. He is the leader of [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=669.28s)]
*  Whole City Council he's been giving his reaction to the collision and what actions are now being taken to contain that damage [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=671.52s)]
*  That's my thoughts go out to all those involved in this terrible incident [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=678.28s)]
*  Obviously the crews on vessels and their family who would have been concerned [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  But also those have taken part in the efforts since the rescue efforts and so on a major major operation [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=686.28s)]
*  And so I'm just really pleased so far people being rescued and taken ashore and I hope that there's more positive news [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=692.28s)]
*  As this unfolds I've been contacted by people locally both within the council outside who are obviously very concerned about this it is [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=698.84s)]
*  Obviously for those involved a terrible incident, but just in terms of the impact on the coast and the air as well [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=707.12s)]
*  I'm sure there's going to be a lot of concern [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=712.0s)]
*  And this is obviously taking place at the moment and it's something that will be developing over the coming hours and days [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=714.4200000000001s)]
*  And so there's a lot to unpack more of this so the Humber itself is known to be one of the most dangerous [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=719.96s)]
*  Eskies in the world in fact and I've met with people who operate the the vessels out there and the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=726.76s)]
*  Cruisant and I know just how difficult is the North Sea itself has its own challenges. It's also incredibly difficult [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=733.56s)]
*  So this would have been [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=739.48s)]
*  Concerned that this event has taken place in this way [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=741.72s)]
*  I'm sure while today's not the day for those sort of questions to be asked [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=744.0s)]
*  There will be the need to know how exactly this has happened so it can be avoided in the future [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=747.88s)]
*  There will need to be the work take place very just to understand what the impact of this would be [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=752.36s)]
*  The short coaches is a wonderful coach [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=757.44s)]
*  We want to see a protective and anything that might be at risk of this is clearly going to cause concern [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  And I will I'm sure there'll be a lot of effort has to be a lot of effort in coming days to fully understand what the impact [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=764.08s)]
*  Has been on this and what actions most importantly we need to be taken to put light any damage [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=769.24s)]
*  Mike Ross there the leader of hulls City Council there is just a line from the US shipping company Crowley which [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  Operates the Stannett immaculate. They are saying that there was a ruptured cargo tank containing that jet a1 fuel [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=781.2s)]
*  So it's a cargo tank that is ruptured [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=788.0s)]
*  Where it is, of course ruptured is a crucial part of the story [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=790.64s)]
*  I would just draw your attention to the live page on the BBC website with all these breaking news lines currently on it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=794.28s)]
*  So do you have a look at that? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a2DsyrozP8&t=800.6s)]
