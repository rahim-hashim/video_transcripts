# The Sims at 25: Why are fans still so 'obsessed'? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4)
*  Hey, I'm Laura from BBC News and we're here to talk about The Sims, the video game series, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=0.0s)]
*  how it's been 25 years since it first started, which is really exciting. It's still got [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  millions of users all around the world. Many people stream it as well as their career, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=18.96s)]
*  including the guys that I'm going to be speaking to now. So let's hear from them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=24.64s)]
*  Jessie, also known as Plumbella, I make videos on The Sims, talking about The Sims history since 2017. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=28.88s)]
*  I'm Molly, I go by the English Simmer Online and I've been playing and streaming and uploading [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=36.72s)]
*  videos about The Sims for the past 11 years now. Hi y'all, name's Mara, also known as xMaraMara, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=42.96s)]
*  and I have been streaming and making Sims content for 10 years. Where has the time gone? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=52.24s)]
*  Tell me about it. So important first question, how did you guys get into playing The Sims? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=60.96s)]
*  So I remember my brother brought it home. I think he got it from a friend's house and then [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=70.8s)]
*  I was never really into like playing with dolls too much. Like I played with kind of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=78.08s)]
*  Polly Pockets and stuff, but I was never like a big Barbie girl. And then I discovered that you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=82.88s)]
*  could basically create like a doll house and play with dolls, but virtually. And so I got really, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=88.8s)]
*  really into Sims from the age of about six years old. I always joke that I probably shouldn't have [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=94.96s)]
*  been playing it that young, but I started creating families and like people that I knew and just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=100.96s)]
*  absolutely fell in love with the game. I think for me, what happened? The first Sims used to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=107.6s)]
*  interest me, but my mom wouldn't let me get it. And then eventually I was able to like let her [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=114.96s)]
*  get me The Sims busting out on console and herbs on console. And that's where my love for Sims [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=120.72s)]
*  started. It started on console and then eventually I was able to play Sims on PC. And it's been me [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=127.52s)]
*  ever since. I started when we had a family computer that everybody used and my brother's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=134.4s)]
*  friend brought around the disc and we installed it on my PC. And then obviously I didn't own the disc, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=141.92s)]
*  so I couldn't play it unless he was around, but I was obsessed with it. But I was obsessed with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  when I found out that you could remove the pool ladder. And I was also obsessed with the noise [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=152.48s)]
*  that played when you made two Sims kiss and it would play all this romantic music. That's what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=156.32s)]
*  drew me in. I think everyone remembers the pool moment, don't they? That's a thing that kind of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=161.68s)]
*  grew out of nowhere, didn't it? And then suddenly people realized they could be really mean. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And everybody wanted to do that for a little bit to The Sims. Apart from these kind of memes that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=172.96s)]
*  we have around The Sims, like taking out the pool ladder, setting things on fire, it holds a lot of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  personal weight for people as well. I wonder what does the series mean for you guys personally? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=185.52s)]
*  As a career, for the past 11 years, it's been ridiculously important to kind of connect with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=190.4s)]
*  people and share my stories. I focus a lot on LGBTQ plus content and I've got to share that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=198.16s)]
*  through The Sims because they've always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=204.56s)]
*  to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation. Also just like incredible [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=209.36s)]
*  friends that we've met through the series. We've all been lucky enough to be invited to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  events over the past few years that we've been able to meet some of our best friends and really [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=219.84s)]
*  like-minded people who all love the same game that we do. And I think we're so privileged to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=226.08s)]
*  be in that position. I think it's just an important vessel of creativity. Like I love seeing the builds [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=231.76s)]
*  people create, the storylines people create, just the things that simmers come up with are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=236.24s)]
*  wonderful. They could be unhinged, like really great funny stuff. And it's just always been one [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=242.08s)]
*  of my favorite, if not my favorite games to express my creativity in ways that I cannot in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=248.64s)]
*  other games and with other outlets. I agree with the other two as well. I started playing when I [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=254.88s)]
*  was five, so I don't actually have any memories of not playing The Sims. It's always just been [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=259.2s)]
*  with me in every single part of my life. Like the teenage years, the uni years. But I also [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  think it's special because even from The Sims 1, it was released with such a sense of community [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=270.88s)]
*  and the ability to take something and customize it and share it with other simmers. And I think [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=276.72s)]
*  that's still prevalent today with custom content, but also as a creator, the way that I see myself [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=282.0s)]
*  and other creators see a challenge and think, how can I take this challenge and make this slightly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  different and put my own spin on it? I mean, Vic Seller's done about a hundred versions of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=293.92s)]
*  Random Engine X challenge. And it's just really interesting to see the ways that people can come [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=299.36s)]
*  off with to use the game in an interesting way. I think that's part of the reason then why we are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=303.52s)]
*  still talking about this game 25 years on. Is it the community or what are the other reasons why [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=308.4s)]
*  this game has just lasted for so long? I remember a few years back, I participated in a competition [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=315.68s)]
*  for gaming and the commentary around me was constantly like, oh my gosh, he's always playing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=321.76s)]
*  Sims. It's Sims, it's Sims, it's Sims. And one person was like, do you notice that every time [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=328.08s)]
*  this girl plays Sims, she finds a different way? Like she's playing multiple different things [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=332.96s)]
*  within this one game. She's taking other games and injecting them within the Sims. That was back [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=337.76s)]
*  when I used to do my Sims Among Us streams, where I had Among Us style streams. I would take [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=345.28s)]
*  different games and inject them. So I definitely think that is the reason why, or one of the main [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  reasons, the main factors and why the Sims has such strong lasting power is the fact that we can [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=356.72s)]
*  take it and do so many different things with it. And creativity knows no bounds with this game. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  It's too much to do. And what do you think, Molly? Yeah, the community are constantly [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=368.56s)]
*  striving for creativity and they take challenges and create these epic storylines. And then if [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=376.0s)]
*  you do happen to end up getting a little bit bored of those Sims or you want to move on to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=385.04s)]
*  something else, it's so easy to start a new game, download an abundance of creator-made custom content [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  and incredible mods that aren't actually officially within the game, but that they have allowed to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=397.6s)]
*  exist for so many years throughout the franchise and encourage modders to kind of play around and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=405.36s)]
*  put their own stamp on the game, which I think is really, really incredible that we have these [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=411.92s)]
*  amazing storytellers and just like so much talent within the community to drive this game to be as [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  open-ended as you really want it to be and wherever your imagination will take you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=428.48s)]
*  Just from looking at you guys, it's obviously, and you're talking about this community, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  it's attracted such a diverse range of players, but obviously it wasn't always like that. And [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=437.52s)]
*  part of that is because of people like yours input. For example, you, Amir, I believe you [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=444.4s)]
*  introduced this melanin pack to kind of help expand the skin tone options for Sim characters. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=449.28s)]
*  Boy, that was the time. That was like nine years ago at this point, eight, nine years ago. So the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  story behind the melanin pack was simply because I started making content for YouTube and I would [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=462.24s)]
*  do my Twitch streams and stuff like that. And I wanted to make dark skin Sims. And one common [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=468.0s)]
*  issue in a lot of video games is that the skin tone options don't get as dark as they should. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=474.64s)]
*  They don't accurately reflect all of the players when it comes to like skin tones. It's very limited. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=481.6s)]
*  Some games I used to play back in the day, it was like very light shades of brown. And I'm like, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=487.76s)]
*  what if I wanted to make a self? I can't even make a self Sim, you know, I couldn't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=492.64s)]
*  do that or make Sims that either look similar to me or maybe family, friends, things like that, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=496.88s)]
*  or just, you know, dark skin Sims. And the issue with Sims 4 is that the darker skin tones were [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=502.64s)]
*  very gray. Like, I always would liken them to you ever leave a chocolate bar around and it goes bad [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=511.04s)]
*  and it gets real white and ashy like, yeah, like the skin tones used to look like that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=518.4s)]
*  And that wasn't just the Sims. That's the case in a lot of games. But the difference between a lot [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=523.6s)]
*  of games and the Sims is I can do something about it. So I took to doing some research. I got in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=530.64s)]
*  Photoshop because I've been doing self-taught graphic design since like 12, 13. So I know my [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=539.76s)]
*  way around Photoshop, look those skills, figured out, found some programs, found out how to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=544.64s)]
*  get the skin tones in the game and spent weeks and months testing it. But I think my final [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=552.4s)]
*  breaking point was even though, even though the community says such is so expansive when it comes [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=557.04s)]
*  to custom content and mods, when it came to skin tones, it still was lacking when it came to darker [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=565.28s)]
*  skin tones. I went through 70 pages of custom content skin tones and still couldn't find [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=570.56s)]
*  darker skin tones that had a vibrant hue. It was like always gray, like a bluish purple. It was [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=579.28s)]
*  literally everything, but like what I was looking for after going through about 70 pages, I was like, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=587.68s)]
*  you know what? I'll figure it out myself. So I did that and released the melon impact, released [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=592.64s)]
*  the betas and it tested, the community tested and stuff like that on Tumblr. I feel like it was a [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=598.8s)]
*  mixed response at first because you had the people that was like, why are you trying to change their [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=606.24s)]
*  game? The skin tones are fine. And then you had people that was like, no, we need this because [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  the Sims are ashy. It even started a hashtag like say no to ashy Sims. And it was a whole thing [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=616.16s)]
*  years ago. It was a very mixed response, but mostly positive though. And what was the reaction [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=622.16s)]
*  as well from the company themselves? Did they reach out to you or what did they say about it? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  At first, I don't even know if they knew about it until I did an interview with AJ Plus back in 2017 [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=637.04s)]
*  and that interview went like super viral. And within, I want to say within like the week or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=645.2s)]
*  two they reached out and then that is where my relationship with Electronic Arts started. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=652.48s)]
*  It went really viral. I was like, oh my God, I'm waking up and my phone is hot from all the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  notifications. I'm like, what's happening here? I was panicking. I mean, diversity is a really [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=663.6s)]
*  hot topic at the moment, not just in gaming, but kind of in wider politics as well. But how do you [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=670.64s)]
*  feel gaming companies should handle implementing things like this? And how do you feel it has been [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  implemented in the Sims? I feel like if you as long, okay, how do I put this? I feel like they [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=684.72s)]
*  should take the steps to make sure people are represented where it makes sense, right? Because [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=693.68s)]
*  I know there's a lot of discussion about diversity, inclusion in games and the conversations [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=699.36s)]
*  always come down to whether it makes sense for certain groups of people to be involved in certain [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=703.84s)]
*  games based on the subject matter of the games. But I feel like with a game like Sims that's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=708.4s)]
*  supposed to be like a life simulator, everybody should be able to, for the most part, make themselves [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=714.16s)]
*  with little to no issue. And I'm hoping that more gaming publishers take note of that going forward. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  I've seen some though, because I actually had a conversation similar the other day where I [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  expressed that since the melanin pack and since that blew up and the changes that have been made [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=735.12s)]
*  within the company or within the game, I've noticed changes in other games. Like I've noticed [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  I play new games and the skin tones look good out the gate. The body types are on point. There's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  more diverse Afro hair options. I can have cornrows, I can have box braids, Afro puffs, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  and it's not third party content and it's not a paid DLC all the time. So there's definitely [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=762.0s)]
*  been changes being made. I think that company should continue to just pay attention, you know, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  pay attention, do their research, do their due diligence. And if you need external sources, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=775.12s)]
*  which means if you need to consult on people who don't work there or who are not in your sphere, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=780.72s)]
*  do that and do it correctly and pay people for their time and their work and their contribution. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=786.48s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about The Sims movie, if that's all right, but just a little bit about [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  what do you guys expect from it? What are you hoping from it? Are there any must haves in this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  film? I'm just hoping that there's some lore in there and that, you know, people who actually play [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=804.72s)]
*  the game can look at it and draw similarities and see the things that they recognize. I know [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=812.32s)]
*  they're going to have to, you know, do things to make it, I guess, palatable to the general public [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=819.6s)]
*  as well. But I'm hoping that like genuine Sims players can watch it and be like, oh wow, I [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=824.32s)]
*  remember that or, you know, some good old classic lore. We're hoping there's an invite to the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=829.52s)]
*  premiere. The green carpet. Yeah, I am really looking forward to it. I think The Sims, what [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=834.48s)]
*  I've always liked about The Sims is like kind of the quirky humor that the franchise has and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=847.04s)]
*  alongside the lore and the stories and the iconic townies that we have. I think the quirkiness of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=852.96s)]
*  the game and like, I think they can make so many gags about like plumb bobs or how Sims can pass [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=861.44s)]
*  away in the game and fires being out of control. And I think even having them as like Easter eggs [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=868.24s)]
*  or like little background scenarios that simmers can kind of pick out and be like, oh, that happened [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=874.08s)]
*  to me when I was like six years old playing this game. I am firmly sat in my idea of wanting it to [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  be a murder mystery. I think a murder mystery with like iconic townies could be so good. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=886.0s)]
*  If they finally answered the question of where Bella is, that could be. I have something really [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=892.16s)]
*  niche to say. Go on, go for it. In this one's new exchange, EA uploaded like a story and it was about [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=898.08s)]
*  this Sim in strange town and the Sim started digging a hole and then at the end of the hole, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=905.44s)]
*  it was a human person. And I hope that they don't go down that route with it because I think that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=910.24s)]
*  would just be Barbie 2.0. I think there's a lot of laughter to draw from. I was going to ask you [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=914.8s)]
*  about that, obviously, because Margot Robbie is obviously involved. So do you think there is that [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=919.12s)]
*  danger of making it quite similar to Barbie or is that actually a good thing? Because it did [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=923.5999999999999s)]
*  amazingly well. I think it could go a bit Truman Show-esque and Barbie-esque with like the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=928.16s)]
*  realization that a Sim is just in a simulation and is being controlled. And I think if it is that, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=934.4s)]
*  that's the main base level of the film. I do think they need to include the lore and the drops to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  make it intriguing and interesting to Simmers. I don't want it to be predictable. That's my only [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=949.12s)]
*  thing because The Sims has spanned for 25 years now and we kind of know the basis of The Sims. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=955.2s)]
*  And I do think that there is a lot of ways that they could throw plot twists into it and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  give a lot of stories of what Simmers would recognize. And I think that base level of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=966.48s)]
*  a Sim realizing they're in a simulation potentially might not be the way to go. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=972.96s)]
*  What do you think, Amira? You were nodding to that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=978.88s)]
*  I agree. No, I agree. That may be a bit too, I guess I would say maybe obvious. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=981.36s)]
*  You know, it's like, yeah, predictable, I would say. So I definitely hope that they do something [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  different. I'm ready to be wowed. Yeah, same. I can't wait for it. It'll be really interesting [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  to see what they do with it. I mean, we're talking about here, it has been 25 years of The Sims. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1002.1600000000001s)]
*  What does it need to do to keep going for another 25 years or even longer? What would you like to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1008.24s)]
*  see in the next few generations of games? Jesse? Give us cars. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1012.56s)]
*  Oh, go on, Amira, go on. No, I just want to say give us cars. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1017.92s)]
*  That's a good point. There hasn't really been, has there? Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  Cars. And Jesse? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1028.72s)]
*  I was just going to say The Sims 5. Oh, they got cancelled. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1032.48s)]
*  And what would you like to see? I mean, I guess as a more broader thing, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1037.68s)]
*  what do these games need to do to compete with things like, for example, Roblox and other, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1043.52s)]
*  you know, dress to impress things like that? I know it's obviously not exactly the same, but [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1048.88s)]
*  what does it need to do to compete with these new games that are coming out or new experiences, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  new titles? I think that interestingly, The Sims has done so well for so long because nobody really [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1058.96s)]
*  took life simulation games seriously. So it's had a monopoly on it when now we're seeing a lot more [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1065.12s)]
*  life simulation games come out because people are like, Oh, hang on. People actually play these [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  games, even though it was the best selling game of all time at one point. So I think that is going [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  to have to really be dedicated to improving the core features of the game and also introducing new [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  ways that we can interact with the base game. I know that Fortnite, for example, that done a [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1090.08s)]
*  complete graphics rehaul a couple of years ago, and that changed how the game looks. I think if [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1096.0s)]
*  it's sticking with The Sims 4, then something like that to be introduced would need to happen. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1101.28s)]
*  Molly, what do you think? Yeah, I think they have stated that The Sims 4 is going to last for [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1107.28s)]
*  numerous more years. And I think if that's going to be kind of their mainline game, they do need to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1113.4399999999998s)]
*  go and look at how they can refresh things and make things feel newer for those people who have [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1119.52s)]
*  been, I mean, it's 11 years this year since the base game came out. And I think restructuring that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1124.56s)]
*  if they can strengthen the code and add more systems in that kind of makes it more reactive. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1130.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of feedback from simmers around the globe of what they can do to kind of keep that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1137.84s)]
*  longevity and what's actually needed to make The Sims 4 feel fresh at this point, other than [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1144.4s)]
*  the paid DLC that we get every year. And I think there's some really interesting ideas out there, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1149.92s)]
*  obviously not a game designer. So I don't know how achievable a lot of these hopes and dreams [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1156.0800000000002s)]
*  that the community have are. But I think to keep that core player base and then to keep it going [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1161.92s)]
*  as a game and keep people invested in it. Although I am also really loving the idea of more spin-offs [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1169.92s)]
*  and they recently just released My Sims, re-released it on the Switch. And I was a huge fan of My Sims [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1176.5600000000002s)]
*  when I was younger. I think they could bring back herbs on PlayStation and Xbox. They could [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1182.4s)]
*  get into different franchises within The Sims and it does seem to be going that way. I think [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1188.96s)]
*  with the return of My Sims, they've kind of spoken about if it could be a possibility to bring back [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1194.72s)]
*  other kind of touch points that people have got into The Sims with. And I think that would be a [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1199.92s)]
*  great thing to kind of get a new generation also into not the mainline life simulation, but like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1206.0s)]
*  hey, we have all of these other great products that we've kind of forgotten about for the last [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1212.3200000000002s)]
*  20 years, but we want people to rediscover them. But no, I joked and I said give us cars, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1216.3200000000002s)]
*  but seriously, there's quite a bit of different things that they could add to keep the longevity, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  to keep things going. And yeah, we definitely need herbs. We need busting out. I'm trying to get, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1226.8s)]
*  you know what I really, really want? I want them to go back and make Sims 3 64 bit. That's what I [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1234.32s)]
*  want. That's what I need for Christmas. Make Sims 3 64 bit so I can play it. But also, yeah, they [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1242.56s)]
*  can go back to Sims 3, Sims 2, add a couple of like maybe some modern code, not to break the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1250.32s)]
*  mods or anything, but just to expand it. Make it 64 bit, like make it so that it's compatible on [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  newer hardware, things like that. But it's definitely a lot they could do. It's definitely [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1264.8s)]
*  a lot they will do. And I'm excited for all of it. Even just seeing the things that they've come [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1271.76s)]
*  out with in like the past, I want to say like the past two, three years has been really dope. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1276.08s)]
*  I've been going back and looking at it because I play very heavily modded. So I've been going back [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  and like looking at like base game and EA created and curated content. And I'm like, oh, this is so [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  nice. Wait, what is this? And I'm finding new stuff every day. They told me about a lunchbox [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1290.72s)]
*  yesterday. So I'm just finding things and it's been pretty awesome. So they're doing great with [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  that. And what's your favourite moment of playing The Sims, either, you know, creating content from [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1299.28s)]
*  it or just being in The Sims? Tell us a favourite moment of it. Somewhere between when I'm just [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1306.16s)]
*  locked in by myself quietly playing with some music or like a background show. But then I also enjoy [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1312.0s)]
*  playing it and like, you know, entertaining the community, talking to them and just watching, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  putting a bunch of mods in my game and then watching the chaos and Sue reacting and providing [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1324.72s)]
*  commentary. I think that's one of my favourite things to do. Just watching the chaos in the game [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1330.16s)]
*  with some good mods and just a good time. How about you, Molly? I think one of my favourites [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1336.16s)]
*  was probably when they dropped toddlers in The Sims 4. I feel like that was such a moment in [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1343.6000000000001s)]
*  like my time capsule of Sims moments where no one really knew that it was coming and it just kind of [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1350.48s)]
*  got dropped out of nowhere. And we were just like, oh, we have this thing. People used to joke, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1357.04s)]
*  like, don't say the T word because they weren't included at the beginning of the game. However, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1363.6s)]
*  they had been in The Sims 2 and Sims 3 and they got removed. And all of a sudden we had these [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1368.8799999999999s)]
*  toddlers back in our game. And that was so much fun. It kind of brought back the like childlike [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1375.36s)]
*  joy that I used to feel like opening a Sims pack and then seeing what the next expansion was in [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1381.36s)]
*  the little leaflet in the box. And it was just so joyful to see everyone kind of celebrate this [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1386.3999999999999s)]

*  fun when they can keep it under wraps and then it's just like, okay, go on, go and explore this in [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1399.36s)]

*  we've been working on in secret for like the last few years. And Jessie. I play very differently to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1411.6799999999998s)]
*  how I post. So I like to post quite chaotic content, like three to four hour long videos talking. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  But in my actual gameplay, I think my favourite moment is when my sim has a baby and it comes up [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1426.16s)]
*  with it's twins. And I always, oh wow, it's triplets. But also for my content, I would say, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1430.8000000000002s)]
*  I like to read object descriptions and book descriptions and all the really boring stuff that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  people don't usually pay attention to because it's a big massive block of text. And then noticing, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1444.96s)]
*  oh, like I just found out yesterday that the tragic clown has an urn dedicated to him in the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1450.32s)]
*  tragic clown colours in The Sims 1 and I never knew that. So finding out bits of information like [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1456.72s)]
*  that, I'm like, oh. There's a lot of lore, isn't there? I think people don't realise that. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1460.96s)]
*  But there is. Yeah. And loads of it's just complete random made up with no consequence. And then it [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  becomes a big thing in the next game. And like even talking about plot twists earlier, we had a [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1470.72s)]
*  plot twist in the horse ranch expansion pack that solved a mystery from The Sims 1. So there's lots [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1475.6s)]
*  of routes to go down. And there's look, there's going to be more to come, I'm sure of it. There's [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1482.0s)]
*  going to be many, many more things I'm sure people will be discussing for years on end because it's [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1488.0s)]
*  just, it just keeps going, doesn't it? Thank you so much, guys. I really appreciate you having a [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hSvONlR1m4&t=1492.48s)]
