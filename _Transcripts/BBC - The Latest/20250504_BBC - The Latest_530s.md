Video Description: A missile fired from Yemen landed near the main terminal of Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Sunday morning, Israeli authorities said.
 
Unverified footage posted online appeared to show drivers on a road nearby pulled over to take cover as a projectile lands, creating a plume of black smoke near the airport, which is on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.
 
Four people were injured due to the blast, with another two injured on their way to a shelter, Israeli media reported, citing emergency services.
 
Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement: "Anyone who hits us, we will hit them seven times stronger".

# Houthi missile from Yemen hits near Israel's Ben Gurion airport | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0)
*  The Houthis in Yemen have claimed responsibility for a missile attack that struck inside the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=0.0s)]
*  perimeter of Ben-Gurion Airport in central Israel. According to initial reports, at least two people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=4.8s)]
*  were hurt. Flights were briefly suspended but have now resumed. The Israeli military says it is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=10.72s)]
*  investigating why air defense systems failed to intercept the missile. The country's defense [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  minister has threatened a forceful response. The developments come after Israel issued orders [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=21.6s)]
*  calling up tens of thousands of reservists ahead of an expanded offensive in Gaza, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  according to several media outlets in the country. According to Israel's public broadcaster, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  the security cabinet is scheduled to meet on Sunday to approve the move. Israeli officials [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  have repeatedly said they will intensify military operations in the strip if Hamas fails to release [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=42.16s)]
*  the remaining hostages. As well as daily airstrikes, all aid has been blocked from entering [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=47.36s)]
*  the territory for two months despite international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=52.63999999999999s)]
*  with warnings that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=57.68s)]
*  Our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bichega gave me the latest from Jerusalem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=61.76s)]
*  So this was a missile that was fired by the Houthis in Yemen and we've seen those images from Tel Aviv, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=66.64s)]
*  an area near Ben-Gurion Airport, which is Israel's main international airport, was hit. We don't know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=73.44s)]
*  whether this was a direct impact from this missile and the authorities here are saying that there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=80.24s)]
*  have been no serious injuries from this attack. The authorities say at least two people have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=86.0s)]
*  been taken to hospital with minor injuries and we had a statement from the Israeli military saying [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=92.64s)]
*  that they are investigating why this missile wasn't intercepted. This is obviously a country that has [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  a very sophisticated air defense system with a very high success rate in intercepting missiles [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=106.32s)]
*  and rockets and we've seen that the Houthis have been firing rockets at Israel saying that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=113.6s)]
*  they are acting in support of Palestinians in Gaza. The vast majority of those missiles are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=119.36s)]
*  intercepted by the Israeli military and there has been some reaction from the Israeli defense [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=124.96s)]
*  minister saying that Israel is going to hit back seven times stronger. We've seen that there have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=131.12s)]
*  been attacks by Israel also by this coalition led by the United States trying to strike Houthi targets [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=137.12s)]
*  in Yemen to stop these attacks not only against Israel but also on ships in the Red Sea. And Hugo [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=145.28s)]
*  what more do we know about these reported plans to call up thousands of Israeli reservists to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=154.08s)]
*  expand their military operation in Gaza? So the Israeli security cabinet is expected to meet later [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=159.76s)]
*  today and this measure is expected to be approved. There has been some speculation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  that the Israeli military is planning an expansion of the military offensive of the war against Hamas [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=174.64s)]
*  in Gaza. What the Israeli authorities are saying is that they're putting pressure on Hamas to release [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  the hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza. We've seen that since Israel ended the ceasefire [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=188.4s)]
*  back in March those negotiations, the international efforts for a new deal not only to guarantee the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  release of the hostages but also for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed to reach any kind of deal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=203.52s)]
*  Also part of this strategy is this blockade on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and we've seen [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  some dramatic reports of the situation in Gaza where aid agencies say that food supplies, water, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=220.72s)]
*  medicine are running low and they've been saying that this is a policy of starvation that could [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=228.88s)]
*  amount to a war crime, something that the Israeli authorities reject. We've seen some protests here [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=234.16s)]
*  in Israel against the war. We've seen also some former officials, military officials, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=241.92s)]
*  urging the authorities to end the war in Gaza and there has been this suspicion for quite some time [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=248.56s)]
*  that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee his [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=253.92s)]
*  political survival. So again the Israeli Security Cabinet expected to meet later today and approved [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=259.92s)]
*  this measure. Hugo Bachege there. Well I also spoke to Dr H. A. Hellier from the Royal United [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=268.32s)]
*  Services Institute. He began by giving me his analysis on the missile strike. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=273.92s)]
*  This was a missile that came from the Houthis in Yemen. I don't think it can be disaggregated from [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=279.44s)]
*  the overall conflict of course that's going on in terms of Israel's war in Gaza. The Houthis have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=286.24s)]
*  made that very clear. Of course they're a terrible group but they're not striking just out of nowhere. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=292.32s)]
*  The question is whether or not we will see measures to de-escalate the situation comprehensively [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=298.88s)]
*  so that there wouldn't be further strikes of this nature or if we're going to see escalation in which [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=304.64s)]
*  case we're going to see more pain and suffering of the Yemenis and thankfully for people throughout [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=309.6s)]
*  the region including Israelis and Palestinians. What's your analysis of this expected move that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=317.12s)]
*  thousands of reservists are to be called up in Israel to expand the operation the Israeli operation in Gaza? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=323.04s)]
*  So I think it's been very clear for many months that there isn't an intention from within [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Tel Aviv within the Israeli government end the war in Gaza. They've made it abundantly clear as [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=339.2s)]
*  you mentioned Israel ended the ceasefire back in March and Israeli officials and Israeli ministers [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=345.2s)]
*  have said very clearly they do not want to end the war in Gaza until they see the complete end [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=352.64s)]
*  of mass in Gaza which of course is not something that any military expert thinks is possible. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  The protests that you've seen over not just the last few days but you know many months now from [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=367.44s)]
*  Israelis indicate that there's a great deal of public support in Israel among the Israeli public [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=374.24s)]
*  for the notion that this war is being prosecuted not to rescue the hostages but to prolong Benjamin [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=380.8s)]
*  Netanyahu's rule as prime minister and I don't think that there's really much doubt about that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=389.44s)]
*  including among I suspect Israeli allies as well the ceasefire proposal that was put forward by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=396.16s)]
*  Biden and then finally implemented via a deal that involved the Biden administration and then [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=404.16s)]
*  the incoming Trump administration at phase one phase two phase three phase one was never truly [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  implemented then was violated almost from day one and phase two of course we never entered into and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  there's really no suggestion that that's going to be returned to there's already been a deal [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=421.76s)]
*  mentioned quite a few times over the last few months for all of the hostages to be released all [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=426.4s)]
*  at once in exchange for an end to the war. Israel has rejected that and I think that that's the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  the stance that is going to persist on taking. So we've seen repeated protests in Israel for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=437.44s)]
*  the past 18 months calling on the hostages to be returned we've also increasingly seen over the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=442.64s)]
*  past few weeks and very unusually some process emerging in Gaza against Hamas and terrible [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=446.8s)]
*  suffering happening in Gaza they hold more than 50 hostages half of whom it's believed are dead [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=452.8s)]
*  in Gaza why won't Hamas hand them back? So first I don't think it's unusual that there are protests [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  against Hamas the the Palestinians of Gaza have a variety of political stances I suspect Hamas is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=467.68s)]
*  actually incredibly unpopular in Gaza particularly over the past 18 months but even before that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=474.72s)]
*  Vis-a-vis why Hamas won't return the hostages for Hamas is a militant group and sees the hostages [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=480.32000000000005s)]
*  very clearly as being leverage the Israeli government has made it very clear that their [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=486.8s)]
*  final goal for Gaza is not simply the removal of Hamas but also the removal of the Palestinian [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=492.32000000000005s)]
*  population from Gaza. Its express support for the Riviera Plan has made it very clear that it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=498.24s)]
*  supports the Riviera Plan this new department within the Ministry of Defense which is set up [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=503.84s)]
*  in order to encourage the the quote-unquote voluntary migration of Palestinians from Gaza [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=509.44s)]
*  of course there's nothing voluntary when you make a territory uninhabitable so I don't think it's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  surprising I mean Hamas is not a good actor by any means but it's not surprising that they wouldn't [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  release what they see as their leverage. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKalAm19g0&t=527.28s)]
