**BBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ)
*  We start this hour with breaking news from here at the BBC actually. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The BBC announcing that Gary Lineker will be leaving the corporation now sooner than [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=4.64s)]
*  originally planned. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=10.98s)]
*  It's understood that Boss has considered his position untenable after he posted an image [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=12.72s)]
*  on social media that was considered to be anti-Semitic. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=17.26s)]
*  With all of the details for us and what we know at this moment, Lisa Mozymber is with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=21.46s)]
*  me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=26.16s)]
*  Lisa, what statement do you have? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=27.16s)]
*  Well, the BBC have just posted in the last few seconds this statement on the BBC Press [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=29.14s)]
*  Office website saying Gary Lineker will leave his presenting role following the conclusion [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  of match of the day for the 2024-25 season. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  He will not be part of the BBC's coverage of the 2026 World Cup or next season's FA [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=42.18s)]
*  Cup coverage. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=48.02s)]
*  And there's a statement from Tim Davie, the BBC's Director General, says Gary has acknowledged [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=49.02s)]
*  the mistake he made. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=53.78s)]
*  Accordingly, we've agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=55.1s)]
*  Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=59.5s)]
*  His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and harmed the respect of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=64.98s)]
*  sports fans across the UK and beyond. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=68.78s)]
*  We want to thank him for the contribution he's made. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=71.98s)]
*  And Gary Lineker said, football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=74.1s)]
*  remember, both on the pitch and in the studio. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=78.42s)]
*  I care deeply about the game and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=81.02s)]
*  As I've said, I would never consciously repost anything anti-Semitic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=85.42s)]
*  It goes against everything I stand for. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=89.5s)]
*  However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused and reiterate how sorry I am. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=91.86s)]
*  Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  That statement just in the last few seconds from the BBC. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Just remind us of how we got to this point, though. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  Last week he reshared a post on social media which referred to Zionism and also which included [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=106.34s)]
*  an image of a rat. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=114.38s)]
*  Now the rodent has historically been used as an anti-Semitic insult. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=116.1s)]
*  He quickly deleted the post and later apologised, saying he hadn't realised the significance [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=121.66s)]
*  of that and he would never knowingly post anything anti-Semitic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=127.58s)]
*  But of course this is the latest in a long line of social media clashes, if you like, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=132.1s)]
*  with the BBC. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=136.9s)]
*  He's been one of the BBC's highest paid and most high profile presenters and he's not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=137.9s)]
*  been afraid of speaking his mind on controversial topics on social media. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=143.7s)]
*  And that's how we've ended up at this point in that he's apologised for what happened [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=149.54s)]
*  last week but both he and the BBC have decided that it's time for them to part. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=152.9s)]
*  He was originally supposed to do the 2026 World Cup and the next FA Cup. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=158.42s)]
*  Now his final broadcast will be on Sunday, the final day of the Premier League season. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=162.82s)]
*  And Lisa, for those of our viewers who are watching from around the world, can you explain [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  what Gary Lineker has meant to many football fans in the country, how important he's been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=172.1s)]
*  to so much of the BBC's coverage of the sport? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=176.77999999999997s)]
*  He's been a huge figure in the world of sport, in the world of football. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  It's harder to think of many people apart from the likes of David Beckham who've made [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=182.94s)]
*  a bigger impact both in the UK and internationally. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=187.1s)]
*  And he made the transition from being a successful England striker and footballer to becoming [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  a successful sports broadcaster. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=196.5s)]
*  He's presented Match of the Day, the BBC's flagship football programme, for more than [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=198.98s)]
*  25 years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=203.7s)]
*  He's seen as an extremely able presenter who, of course, because of his unique position [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=205.78s)]
*  as a former professional and international footballer, brought an insight that most other [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=210.64s)]
*  people couldn't bring to sports broadcasting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=215.54s)]
*  So that combination of being incredibly insightful with an incredible bank of knowledge, along [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=218.22s)]
*  with being a very polished and well thought of presenter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  That's why he's such a big deal for people here in the UK because he's representative [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=227.7s)]
*  of perhaps the most popular sport in the UK and one of the BBC's most well thought of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  and historically important programmes, Match of the Day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=237.94s)]
*  Some of his social media comments that have been controversial in the past have really [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=240.38s)]
*  raised issues around the BBC's impartiality and also how BBC guidelines are enforced. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=243.66s)]
*  What has been the reaction to this last post that has in a way been different though to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=248.98s)]
*  what we've had before? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=253.34s)]
*  Well there have been calls for his resignation when that post happened. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=255.3s)]
*  There have been others who have taken a different view of saying he made a mistake and he apologised [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=259.66s)]
*  but within the BBC we understand people regarded this last issue as being something that made [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=264.9s)]
*  his position here untenable and I would imagine there have been high level discussions over [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  the past few days about how to deal with this and this is the result, the BBC and Gary Lineker [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=277.1s)]
*  deciding to go their separate ways. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=283.1s)]
*  Lisa, thanks so much. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=285.38s)]
*  More on that story on the BBC News website and they will have that statement that has [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=286.94s)]
*  just been released in the past few minutes or so up there very shortly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=291.02s)]
*  So do log on and take a look for the latest. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6Hj4eQnAQ&t=294.5s)]
