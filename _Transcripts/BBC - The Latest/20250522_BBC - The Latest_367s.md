Video Description: The UK's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius can go ahead, a High Court judge has ruled. 
 
The deal was stopped by a last-minute court injunction in early hours of Thursday morning - but that was discharged just after 12:30 GMT.
 
The UK wants to hand over control of the Indian Ocean islands to Mauritius, before paying to lease the existing US-UK military base.
 
The government welcomes the High Court lifting the injunction, saying the deal is "vital to protect the British people and our national security".
 
"I'm beyond horrified and angry," one Chagossian campaigner told the BBC - another says: "We are not giving up."

# Deal to hand over Chagos Islands to Mauritius can go ahead, UK court rules | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y)
*  A judge has ruled in favour of the UK government over a deal to formally hand over the Chegos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Islands to Mauritius. The Prime Minister, Sakia Starmer, was due to attend a virtual [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=5.96s)]
*  signing ceremony this morning, but at the last minute the ceremony was postponed on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=10.24s)]
*  the orders of the High Court. A legal challenge had been brought by two Chegosian women, Bernadette [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=14.8s)]
*  Dugas and Bertrice Pomp, who would like to return to live on the islands but under the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=20.56s)]
*  new deal are prevented from returning. The deal would see Chegos retain UK and US military [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=26.04s)]
*  bases for the next 99 years. Our Home Affairs correspondent Mark Easton has been following [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=31.96s)]
*  developments outside the High Court. Originally this injunction put in place on the basis [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=38.6s)]
*  that two Chegosians who had been forcibly removed by the British when they were babies [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=44.36s)]
*  to the Seychelles, that before the British could do a deal with Mauritius saying that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=51.56s)]
*  the Chegos Islands, Diego Garcia, the island that they were from, should become Mauritian [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=56.72s)]
*  territory, that they hadn't properly consulted the small group, a few hundred people, who [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  are in the Seychelles who are also from Diego Garcia. Now Mr Justice Chamberlain in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=67.4s)]
*  High Court here now has said, no, that's not enough to prevent the British government from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=74.0s)]
*  doing the deal. He has discharged the injunction. It is now possible for the UK government to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=79.68s)]
*  go ahead with that. I'm told it could even happen later today. I don't know whether it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=84.0s)]
*  will. In terms of an appeal, there is a mechanism whereby you can appeal against this decision [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=89.72s)]
*  whether or not the judge would be minded to do that, we're not sure. But really this is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=96.28s)]
*  probably only in any event a sort of temporary glitch in the process and the likelihood [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=102.44s)]
*  is that at some stage, either today or perhaps in the next few weeks, a deal will be done [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  which will see the Chegos Islands returned to Mauritius control. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=114.12s)]
*  Mark Easton there outside the High Court. It's an extremely complex issue. The diaspora [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=120.24s)]
*  from the Chegos Islands went in many different directions. They each want different things. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=123.84s)]
*  To get a bit of background on that, I spoke earlier to our correspondent Andrew Hardy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=129.39999999999998s)]
*  who is in Paris. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=133.16s)]
*  We were there three years ago and the first thing I think to understand about the Chegos [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=134.16s)]
*  archipelago is that it's incredibly remote. It took us five days hard sailing east across [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=138.92s)]
*  the Indian Ocean from Seychelles, already a fairly remote part of Africa. And the population [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=144.72s)]
*  that was forced from the islands, a very small number, just over a thousand people back in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=153.44s)]
*  the late 60s and 70s, those Chegos Islanders, some of them ended up in Mauritius, some in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=158.64s)]
*  the Seychelles and others ended up in the UK. They are a marginalised, vulnerable group, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=164.16s)]
*  many of them still living in poverty, a very small group now and they are worried that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=169.72s)]
*  decisions are being taken over their heads. Some support the Mauritian government and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  its claim, this long legal battle that it's fought and is now seems to be on the cusp [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=177.32s)]
*  of winning to reclaim control of the Chegos Islands. Others say, no, we want to be independent [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=182.44s)]
*  as Chegosians and make our own decisions and others living in the UK say, well, no, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=188.5s)]
*  we want to back the UK and we want to remain in the UK but we don't like this deal because [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=193.78s)]
*  we feel that it may not give us the rights to return, particularly to Diego Garcia, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=199.26s)]
*  is this one big island where, of course, the Americans have this giant military base, a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=205.02s)]
*  base that's so important for the US and which is why the British government is pushing ahead [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  with this deal because it thinks this is the best way to secure long term the legal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=216.02s)]
*  logistical future of that base. There are people who can trace their roots to the Chegos [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=221.78s)]
*  Islands who are opposed to it. There are also people here in the UK who are opposed to it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=227.46s)]
*  purely on the grounds of security. As you say, they're crucially important. It's a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=231.86s)]
*  crucially important base, Diego Garcia, notably for the US military. What is the concern among [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=236.58s)]
*  those who have security issues here and what is the context of the deal that the British [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=242.1s)]
*  government is about to sign up to? So the argument being made against this deal is basically [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=248.22s)]
*  these are uncertain times. China is expanding its influence around the world. It's looking [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=254.66s)]
*  for influence in the Indian Ocean. Why give away sovereignty of an archipelago that Britain [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=259.54s)]
*  currently owns and risk giving it to Mauritius, a country that potentially could, all sorts [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=266.38s)]
*  of things could happen to it. It could fall under Chinese influence. The Americans could [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=274.66s)]
*  somehow lose control of the base. Why take that risk in uncertain times? The reply to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=278.82s)]
*  that from the government and now from the American administration, which has also given [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=285.38s)]
*  sometimes grudgingly its approval to this deal, is look, Britain had these islands. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=291.12s)]
*  It's had them for all these years, but in the last decade or so, international opinion [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  has swung sharply against the UK. The last time this was put to a vote at the UN General [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=303.64s)]
*  Assembly, only five nations on earth backed the UK's claim to keep hold of the Chegos [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  Islands. Andrew Harding with the history of the Chegos Islands, there is a live page currently [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  running on the BBC website. Let me just read you a couple of lines from James Eadie, the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=320.52s)]
*  government lawyer who was in court this morning. He said the delay was damaging to British [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=324.8s)]
*  interests and there is jeopardy, he says, to our international relations, including with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=330.44s)]
*  our most important security and intelligence partner, the United States. He went on to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=335.34s)]
*  say that everybody is now standing by to sign the deal. Responding to the judge, he said [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=340.92s)]
*  the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office need a decision by 1pm today if we're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=347.92s)]
*  to sign it today and everyone is standing by. We'll keep you posted on that virtual [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=354.92s)]
*  signing ceremony if it is reconvened. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J90tkMsI47Y&t=361.92s)]
