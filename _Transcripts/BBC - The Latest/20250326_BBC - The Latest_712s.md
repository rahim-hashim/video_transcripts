Video Description: Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg has published the exact text messages that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent to a high-level White House group chat providing key details about the US strike on Houthi forces in Yemen just hours before the attacks began.
 
Goldberg has said he's written a follow-up piece because people deserve to see the texts as they are in the public interest following claims by Trump officials that Goldberg had been lying.
 
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has dismissed the latest article in the Atlantic as "another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well known for his sensationalist spin".
 
Meanwhile, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are being grilled about the security breach before a House committee.

# White House blasts Atlantic reporter in Signal leak as new messages revealed | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg)
*  The Atlantic magazine has published the full exchange of messages between senior White House officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=0.0s)]
*  as the US conducted strikes in Yemen earlier this month. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=6.4s)]
*  The magazine's editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to a chat on the encrypted app Signal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=10.24s)]
*  in a major security breach. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  The magazine initially did not publish the full details of the group chat, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  saying it didn't want to release classified information. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=21.6s)]
*  Let's just get a flavour of some of those messages. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=24.48s)]
*  For example, at 14.10, more F-18s launch. Second strike package. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=27.36s)]
*  14.15, strike drones on target. This is when the first bombs will definitely drop. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=33.68s)]
*  15.36, F-18 second strike starts. Also, first sea-based tomahawks launched. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=39.84s)]
*  Well, earlier, President Trump's National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, said he accepted [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=48.16s)]
*  full responsibility for the security breach. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=53.04s)]
*  The White House House Select Committee on Intelligence has been questioning [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=56.48s)]
*  national security chiefs in the last hour. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  The Director of the US National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has been asked about her testimony [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=63.28s)]
*  at yesterday's committee following the Atlantic's full release today of messages on Signal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=68.56s)]
*  So it's your testimony that less than two weeks ago you were on a Signal chat that had all of this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=74.24s)]
*  information about F-18s and MQ-9 Reapers and targets on strike and you in that two-week period [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=80.24s)]
*  simply forgot that that was there. That's your testimony? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=86.08s)]
*  My testimony is I did not recall the exact details of what was included there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=88.72s)]
*  That was not your testimony. Your testimony was that you were not aware of anything related [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=94.72s)]
*  to weapons packages, targets and timing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=99.6s)]
*  As the testimony yesterday continued on, there were further questions related to that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=103.52s)]
*  where I acknowledged that there was a conversation about weapons and I don't remember the exact [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=109.36s)]
*  wording that I used, but I did not recall the specific details that were included. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=117.36s)]
*  Director Gabbard, you've reasserted that there was no classified information. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=123.68s)]
*  I think we can all agree that that information shouldn't have been out there, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=129.04s)]
*  but let me ask you this. Are you familiar with the ODNI's classification guidance? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=132.24s)]
*  I'm familiar with it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=137.52s)]
*  I actually got a copy right here. If I read you a part of that guidance, I wonder if you could [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=138.0s)]
*  tell me what the level of classification indicated is. I'm reading from your classification guidance [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=145.12s)]
*  and the criteria is information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=151.28s)]
*  or its allies are preparing an attack. Do you recall what your own guidance would suggest [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=158.4s)]
*  that that be classified? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=164.16s)]
*  I don't have the specifics in front of me, but it would point to what was shared would fall under [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=166.24s)]
*  the DOD's classification system and the Secretary of Defense's authority to determine what is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=172.72s)]
*  classified and what is not. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=179.2s)]
*  I guess you don't have it, but information providing, this is the ODNI guidance, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=181.04s)]
*  information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=186.32s)]
*  an attack should be classified as top secret. Do you disagree with that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=190.96s)]
*  I don't disagree with that. I just point out that the DOD classification guidance is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  separate from the ODNI's classification guidance. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=204.08s)]
*  Do you think it would be materially different? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, the Secretary of Defense holds the authority to classify or declassify. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think it's likely that DOD guidance is materially different from what I just read? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=214.88s)]
*  I haven't reviewed the DOD guidance, so I can't comment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Tulsi Gebhard, they're being questioned at the House committee, which is still continuing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=223.44s)]
*  You can see there she is with other senior leaders, John Ratcliffe of the CIA and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=228.08s)]
*  Kash Patel there. You can see the FBI director speaking at the moment and they are all taking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  questions. The committee is supposed to be looking at global threats, the global threat [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=241.28s)]
*  assessment for this year, but they are obviously also being questioned about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=246.48s)]
*  these revelations from this week. Let's go live to Washington and our North America [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=250.16s)]
*  correspondent, Nomiya Iqbal. Nomiya, just to go back on some of the clip that we played from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=256.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gebhard, we were both listening to yesterday's questions to Tulsi Gebhard and John Ratcliffe [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=261.28s)]
*  where they were asked whether there was any mention of weapons or weapons systems and their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=267.92s)]
*  answers, the notes that I've made, say that they basically replied saying they didn't recall [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=272.4s)]
*  specific names or weapons systems being mentioned. Today Tulsi Gebhard was asked about that and said [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  she did then go on to say that there might have been some reference to weapons but she couldn't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  recall the exact language. They are still fundamentally, however, denying that any wrongdoing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=290.4s)]
*  has happened here. They are and you only have to look at the text messages to see that what they [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=297.52s)]
*  are saying is not true because these messages, looking at them that The Atlantic has published, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=305.12s)]
*  the leaked military strikes chat, show defence secretary Hegseth sharing precise airstrike plans, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=312.32s)]
*  timings, targets, mission updates, it covers everything from F-18 launches to drone strikes, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  you've got timestamps on it which you read out earlier, mission confirmed at this time, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=327.04s)]
*  at this time drones on target. Earlier I was speaking to Glenn Gerstel who is a former [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=333.6s)]
*  general counsel of the National Security Agency, he served under President Obama and President [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=340.24s)]
*  Trump and I said to him what do you make of this and he said look these texts they could have been [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=344.88s)]
*  declassified afterwards, we don't know if they were, the Trump administration hasn't said anything [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=349.44s)]
*  but not at the time, we're talking about imminent military action he said involving American troops [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=355.44s)]
*  that is classified, that is classified information and so they are again being asked about it today [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=361.6s)]
*  and I just want to give you an update from John Ratcliffe the CIA director, he's saying, he's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=369.6s)]
*  still adamant that he did not share classified information, Tulsi Gabbard is saying that the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=376.32s)]
*  Signal message app in which they were using the commercial app comes pre-installed on government [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=380.8s)]
*  devices, going back to Mr Gerstel when I asked him about Signal he said generally it's not used [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=386.56s)]
*  on government devices and so much of that is because it's not a secure network at all [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=392.48s)]
*  and just also to let you know Geeta, I said to him look the White House is saying that the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=400.72s)]
*  strikes were successful and that is a way of responding to the concerns about the breach of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=406.56s)]
*  national security but he said to me the issue isn't really about the strikes and that nothing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=411.6s)]
*  went wrong, to quote him he said it can't possibly be the case that the test of if a communication is [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=416.24s)]
*  appropriate or not is that something bad didn't happen. Okay Nomiya we'll leave it there for now [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=420.72s)]
*  but we'll be back with you as this committee continues today, let's just bring in now White [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  House Colonist at the Hill, Niall Stanage. Niall thanks for being with us just specifically on [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=434.56s)]
*  this question of what was or wasn't revealed in these messages, the Atlantic magazine has published [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=440.48s)]
*  the messages the only thing it seems to have withheld still is the name of a staff member but the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=446.16s)]
*  messages do mention timings of the attack which seem to be in real time and weapon systems and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=451.68s)]
*  that is something that both the CIA director and Toti Gabbard seemed to broadly deny had been [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=457.44s)]
*  mentioned, they certainly said they didn't recall details of weapons or weapons systems being [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=465.36s)]
*  revealed in the chat and whether this is classified or not the point is if any other country or group [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=470.8s)]
*  was able to read into these messages does that pose a risk to US national security and those [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=477.44s)]
*  involved in this mission? Yes indeed and the answer seems manifestly yes doesn't it, I mean [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=483.92s)]
*  any situation where in a commercial messaging app people are sending around plans for an attack that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=490.8s)]
*  has not yet happened on a foreign country is on its face a security breach and I was listening to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=498.8s)]
*  what your other correspondent was noting correctly about this debate about what was classified and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=506.64s)]
*  what was not, one does wonder if the Trump administration people are taking refuge in a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=511.52s)]
*  rather lawyerly phrasing which does leave open the possibility of information being declassified [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=516.72s)]
*  after the event that does not to my mind or in the opinion I think of any fair-minded person [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=523.12s)]
*  mitigate the actual risk at the time. And we've been hearing John Ratcliffe giving evidence [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=529.36s)]
*  saying you know criticizing the Atlantic journalist who he says quotes intentionally [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=536.0s)]
*  intended to indicate he transmitted classified information in the chat and he denies that he [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=542.16s)]
*  transmitted classified information. I think the question for so many people now is what happens [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=547.68s)]
*  next? We've heard from Trump clarifying that maybe they will look again at the use of signal [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=555.52s)]
*  but there's obviously a lot of conversation at the top levels of all governments that can be [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=561.52s)]
*  very dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands and can the American public have confidence about [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=567.12s)]
*  confidentiality at the top of the administration at the moment? Well any question that is phrased [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=572.96s)]
*  around the American public is right now I think disputable because the American public is now so [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=580.0s)]
*  polarized and there's a significant swathe of the American public that will frankly defend President [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=588.4s)]
*  Trump almost regardless of what he does and there's a swathe of the American public that will condemn [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=594.08s)]
*  him almost regardless of what he does. But in terms of whether there should be confidence it's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=599.2s)]
*  hard to have confidence whenever there's a lapse involving someone bringing a journalist onto a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=604.72s)]
*  group chat of this level of sensitivity and nobody seems to notice he was there, nobody asks [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=612.0s)]
*  questions about who the unidentified person is and these extraordinary details are discussed. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=617.84s)]
*  Just briefly Geeta I would add I am not hearing any real possibility of there being firings over [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=624.96s)]
*  this at least in the short term because President Trump tends to regard anything like that as a [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=631.44s)]
*  capitulation to the media and he's loath to do anything that appears to capitulate to anybody [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=637.12s)]
*  particularly the media. And just finally the US Vice President JD Vance has responded also to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=643.2s)]
*  the Atlantic stories saying that the journalist quotes oversold what he had and the White House [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=649.2s)]
*  press secretary Karen Levitt earlier called it another hoax quotes so obviously very very [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  firm pushback continuing. Is there any branch of the government that could independently and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=661.12s)]
*  separately investigate in a neutral way what has been going on? I don't think so because one of the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=668.88s)]
*  issues here is that inspectors general who are the people generally empowered to do that have been [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=676.24s)]
*  fired en masse earlier on and from administration so I think that that is unlikely. I also think [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=682.24s)]
*  we should underscore that that pushback calling the story a hoax is pretty hollow in itself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=688.64s)]
*  The germane details here have been confirmed by the National Security Council itself that this [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=695.36s)]
*  was a genuine chat that took place it is not a hoax in any meaningful sense. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=702.16s)]
*  Niles Danage, columnist at The Hill, thank you very much for your time today. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLYK7xzTyvg&t=707.12s)]
