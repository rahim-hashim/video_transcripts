Video Description: Rory McIlroy has completed a career Grand Slam in golf with his win at the US Masters tournament.
 
The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland has become only the sixth man and the first European to win the career Grand Slam of Masters, Open Championship, US Open and US PGA Championship titles.
 
Tiger Woods was among the first to congratulate McIlroy on winning the Masters, welcoming him to the exclusive club.
 
Woods, a 15-time major winner, had been the last player to win the Grand Slam in 2000, joining Americans Jack Nicklaus (1966) Ben Hogan (1953), Gene Sarazan (1935) and South Africa's Gary Player (1965).

*  Rory McIlroy has edged his name into golfing history by winning the US Masters in Georgia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=0.0s)]
*  to complete the career Grand Slam. He beat England's Justin Rose in a tense playoff at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=5.04s)]
*  the Augusta National. It is McIlroy's first Masters win and makes him the first European [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=10.56s)]
*  to complete a career Grand Slam of golf's four major tournaments. He is only the sixth player [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=15.44s)]
*  to win all four, the US Masters, the US Open, the US PGA and the British Open. Our reporter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=20.64s)]
*  Stephen Watson spoke to Rory McIlroy shortly after his win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=27.12s)]
*  You told me as a young boy 25 years ago that this was your dream to win all four majors. So what's it like to be standing here today to have achieved it? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=57.12s)]
*  I feel incredibly fortunate and grateful and my mum and dad saw potential in me and they did everything [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=87.36s)]
*  possible to help me try to fulfil that potential. This is as much theirs as it is mine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=97.84s)]
*  I wish they were here to celebrate with me tonight but hopefully I'll see them in a couple days time [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  and we're going to, it's amazing. There were probably times in my life where I thought that this was never going to happen [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=115.28s)]
*  and there were a few low points driving out of Magnolialien on Sunday nights and it not happening [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=127.36s)]
*  but to finally get the job done this year is just unbelievably satisfying and it's just such a special moment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=133.04s)]
*  What does it mean to have won the career Grand Slam? You are now a golfing great for all time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  You can come back to Augusta for the rest of your life. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=151.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it'll sink in for a while. There was only five other players in history that have done it [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=154.0s)]
*  and they're all Jack, Tiger, Gary Player, Gene Cyrus and Ben Hogan. They're the crème de la crème of golf [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=164.0s)]
*  and to think that I've been able to put my name alongside theirs, yeah, you know, I said, had a little reception with the members [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=173.68s)]
*  and I said I'm going to be going to that Champions Dinner every Tuesday night and they're going to have to wheel me out of here when I'm 90 years old. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=182.88s)]
*  I mean the way you won it today, what drama, it was absolutely box office. What was it like to be involved in knowing you were carrying [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=190.56s)]
*  all that burden and the weight of expectation on your shoulders as well? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=199.44s)]
*  Yeah, when I hit the ball in the water on 13, I thought, I had a look at the board and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=203.52s)]
*  I saw I was tied for the lead at that point and then I saw Justin Rose had just made a birdie to go to 11, so I was one behind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=213.92s)]
*  and I thought, you know, it's okay, I've still got 14, 15, or maybe birdie holes and a bogey 14 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=221.28s)]
*  and all of a sudden I'm really, you know, my back's really against the wall and then, you know, I pulled out a great shot when I needed it on 15 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=228.16s)]
*  and from there then I, you know, I played some really great golf and, you know, had a chance in regulation obviously to get the job done [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=236.88s)]
*  and wasn't able to take it but for how I saw it, I think that the last hole in regulation to the first, the playoff hole, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=245.6s)]
*  it was like a microcosm of the whole week. It was like one bad hole followed by one great hole and that was sort of how the story of the week was. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuducF7mpv4&t=254.72s)]
