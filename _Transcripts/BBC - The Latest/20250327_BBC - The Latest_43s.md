*  South Korea is battling one of the worst wildfires ever in its history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=0.0s)]
*  It all began on 21st of March in the country's southeast and it's been raging for days. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=4.16s)]
*  The flames have spread across multiple cities and counties leaving behind casualties, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=9.44s)]
*  burning people's houses and even threatening national treasures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=14.16s)]
*  So why is the fire spreading so quickly? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=17.84s)]
*  Well, the weather is playing a major role. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=20.0s)]
*  Unseasonably warm weather, strong gusts of wind and dry conditions are fueling the flames. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=21.76s)]
*  There's another factor too, pine trees. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=26.96s)]
*  This region has one of the largest pine forests in the country [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=28.8s)]
*  and they're especially vulnerable to wildfires. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Authorities say the fire likely started accidentally by human activity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=34.56s)]
*  As fire crews are working around the clock, they're now hoping for one thing to help, rain. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXQp664Jpsg&t=38.56s)]
