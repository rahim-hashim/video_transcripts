# Israel and Iran launch new missile waves as Donald Trump wants ‘real end’ to conflict | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso)
*  We start in the Middle East with a number of major developments to bring you in Israel, Iran and also in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=0.0s)]
*  So let's begin with something which could be a key indicator of how the U.S. is viewing the conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=6.0s)]
*  We can see President Trump here arriving in Washington just after five in the morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=13.0s)]
*  He cut short his trip to the G7 summit in Canada. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=17.0s)]
*  His spokesperson had told us that he wasn't leaving early due to the fighting in the Middle East, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=20.0s)]
*  but he was pushed by reporters on Air Force One. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=25.0s)]
*  And then it was clear that the situation was still very high on his agenda. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=28.0s)]
*  He told reporters he was in no mood to negotiate with Iran. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=32.0s)]
*  I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=37.0s)]
*  That was Emmanuel, nice guy, but he hasn't got it right too often. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=39.0s)]
*  But we're not looking for better. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=43.0s)]
*  Right now we're doing pretty well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=46.0s)]
*  Remember, Iran cannot have hate-nulled weapons. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=49.0s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=52.0s)]
*  We don't have to go too deep into it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=53.0s)]
*  They just can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=55.0s)]
*  What was the thinking on the call for Tehran to evacuate? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=57.0s)]
*  Is there a threat or is there incoming? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=61.0s)]
*  What was the thinking on the full evacuation? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=63.0s)]
*  I want people to be safe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=65.0s)]
*  That's always possible. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=67.0s)]
*  A thing like that could happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=69.0s)]
*  I just want people to be safe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=71.0s)]
*  Is there any new concern about U.S. troops or assets in the region at all today? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=73.0s)]
*  Great people that know how to protect themselves. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=78.0s)]
*  When you say better, what's the... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=81.0s)]
*  We'll come down so hard if they do anything to our people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=83.0s)]
*  We'll come down so hard that their gloves are off so beautifully. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=86.0s)]
*  No, they... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=89.0s)]
*  I think they know not to touch our troops. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=92.0s)]
*  Sound not great on Air Force One, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=96.0s)]
*  but the words that everyone is really looking into at the moment [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=98.0s)]
*  is when he said we are looking at something better than a ceasefire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=101.0s)]
*  Not clear what that meant, but lots of speculation, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=105.0s)]
*  and we'll be delving into that throughout the program. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=108.0s)]
*  The rest of the world, of course, are watching these events very, very closely. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=110.0s)]
*  China accusing Mr. Trump of pouring oil on the conflict [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=114.0s)]
*  and urging its citizens to leave Iran and Israel as soon as possible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=117.0s)]
*  And the European Union's Foreign Affairs Representative, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=121.0s)]
*  Kaia Callas, had this to say about potential U.S. intervention. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=123.0s)]
*  When it comes to the United States getting involved, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=128.0s)]
*  then it will definitely drag the region into a border conflict, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=132.0s)]
*  and this is in nobody's interest. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=137.0s)]
*  And from my call with Secretary of State Rubio, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=140.0s)]
*  he emphasized that it's also not in their interest to be drawn into this conflict. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=144.0s)]
*  Israel has been conducting its fifth day of attacks on Iran, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=150.0s)]
*  which is also launching its own missile and drone strikes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=153.0s)]
*  There have been more casualties on both sides. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=156.0s)]
*  The Israeli military has issued more evacuation orders for parts of Tehran. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=158.0s)]
*  This footage was filmed there earlier today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=162.0s)]
*  You can see everyone trying to leave the city, filling up their cars with fuel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=165.0s)]
*  Many of the drivers are saying it's really hard to get fuel, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=169.0s)]
*  and the roads are chock-full of cars and really stressful trying to get out of the city. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=173.0s)]
*  Israel says it's hit a number of missile and drone launch sites in the west of Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=179.0s)]
*  Iran says it's carried out successful missile attacks on Israeli military intelligence headquarters [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=185.0s)]
*  and officers' housing Mossad, although there's no evidence of this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=190.0s)]
*  Missiles also fired at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, this was Tel Aviv early this morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=204.0s)]
*  Apparently, as an Iranian airstrike was taking place, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=206.0s)]
*  it appears that the overnight attacks from Iran have been less intense than in recent days, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=209.0s)]
*  with no reports of any deaths, though. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=214.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it's identified additional elements [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=217.0s)]
*  that indicate a direct impact on underground enrichment holes at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=221.0s)]
*  The underground enrichment plant was one of several targeted by Israeli strikes on Friday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=227.0s)]
*  The Global Nuclear Watchdog says this latest assessment is based on continued analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=232.0s)]
*  It added that there were no changes to reports from the Fordow and Isfahan enrichment plants in other parts of the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=239.0s)]
*  Well, let's take you to Israel now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=248.0s)]
*  We can join our correspondent, Ayoni Wells, who is in Hezliya, which is in the north of Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=250.0s)]
*  What's happened there, Ayoni? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=257.0s)]
*  Well, here in Hezliya, which is just north of Tel Aviv, it's coastal, normally touristy city, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=261.0s)]
*  you can see behind me that a bus depot was hit by an Iranian missile this morning. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=267.0s)]
*  There's multiple buses behind me that have suffered pretty extensive damage. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=272.0s)]
*  This one has been completely gutted by flames. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=276.0s)]
*  Now, we can estimate from where this is what the target of this Iranian missile was, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=279.0s)]
*  but Israeli censorship rules mean we cannot broadcast that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=286.0s)]
*  In the meantime, though, we can say that nobody here was hurt, nobody was injured. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=290.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem that there were people in the area. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=295.0s)]
*  I've spoken to people in the wider Herzliya region who say that they reported hearing loud booms, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=297.0s)]
*  they saw plumes of smoke when this happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=303.0s)]
*  And just here you can see the site where this missile appeared to have hit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=305.0s)]
*  It's about five meters deep. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=310.0s)]
*  This clearly made a significant impact. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=312.0s)]
*  People reported, as I say, hearing very loud explosions in Herzliya when this went off [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=315.0s)]
*  and seeing smoke even across the other side of the city. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=320.0s)]
*  So this is one of the main direct hits that has been reported as part of those retaliatory Iranian strikes today. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=324.0s)]
*  In the meantime, we know that there are more strikes that have been retorted in Tehran. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=331.0s)]
*  Oney, what have people been telling you that you've managed to speak to about how they feel [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=336.0s)]
*  about their sense of safety and whether the Iron Dome can protect them at the moment? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=341.0s)]
*  Well, there are mixed feelings about this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=348.0s)]
*  I think certainly there is a feeling of shock about how many in the last couple of days have got through now. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=350.0s)]
*  Still, of course, the overwhelming majority have been intercepted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=356.0s)]
*  But some Israelis that I've spoken to have said that they're not used to seeing things get through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=359.0s)]
*  And it has felt like this conflict has been a lot closer to home, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=364.0s)]
*  particularly in areas that I've visited like Bat Yam, like Tamra, like here in Herzliya, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=367.0s)]
*  which have suffered from direct hits. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=371.0s)]
*  In terms of the response, though, to the Israeli government [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=374.0s)]
*  and what people think they should be doing in response to some of these direct hits, it does vary. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=377.0s)]
*  Some I've spoken to remain supportive of the Israeli government [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=381.0s)]
*  and say that they feel even though some of their communities are suffering as a result, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=385.0s)]
*  the government should continue striking Iran because they see a sort of bigger picture aim [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=390.0s)]
*  of what they describe as striking Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=394.0s)]
*  However, I've also spoken to some Israelis who say that this isn't representative of all Israelis [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=399.0s)]
*  and they would like the government to stop. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=404.0s)]
*  Some that I spoke to, for example, yesterday, cited that they fear this will damage negotiations [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=406.0s)]
*  to release hostages from Gaza. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=411.0s)]
*  Others said that they felt this had taken attention off Gaza [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=413.0s)]
*  and they weren't happy with what the Israeli government and the IDF were doing, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=416.0s)]
*  both there but also in Iran at the moment. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=419.0s)]
*  So there are some mixed views among Israelis about how the government is responding to this, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=422.0s)]
*  but certainly I think something that everyone shares is a sense of shock [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=426.0s)]
*  that this is hitting communities, buildings, some residential areas even, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=429.0s)]
*  bringing this much closer to home for them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=434.0s)]
*  Ayumi, as we speak to you, we are also getting live pictures from just south of Tel Aviv, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=436.0s)]
*  which we're going to share with our viewers as well. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=440.0s)]
*  This is the site of another strike at Roshon LeZion. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=443.0s)]
*  And the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel, Gideon Sa'a, is there just talking to people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=447.0s)]
*  and looking at the damage that has been done there in Roshon LeZion. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=454.0s)]
*  What is the official word coming out from the government at the moment [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=460.0s)]
*  about how long this could take and what it is they want now from the Americans? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, that is a question that many are asking. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=470.0s)]
*  What is the sort of long-term strategy? What's the endgame here for Israel? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=472.0s)]
*  And at the moment, we don't necessarily know. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=476.0s)]
*  The rhetoric coming out of Israeli ministers has certainly been clear [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=478.0s)]
*  that they want to carry on until they feel they have completely sort of eliminated Iran's nuclear program. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=482.0s)]
*  They've also, though, hinted that they are increasingly targeting, of course, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=489.0s)]
*  top military targets, including personnel but also infrastructure, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=493.0s)]
*  but also targets associated with the regime, whether that be media, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=497.0s)]
*  whether that be people close to the leadership in Iran. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=500.0s)]
*  So that is something which we know we are increasingly hearing from members of the government [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=504.0s)]
*  about what this endgame might look like. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=510.0s)]
*  But it is unclear, as you say, what the endgame will be, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=512.0s)]
*  at what point would they consider their sort of offensive on Iran at the moment a success, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=515.0s)]
*  and as you say, what involvement would they want from the U.S. at the moment, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=520.0s)]
*  particularly from President Donald Trump? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=524.0s)]
*  Ayoni, good to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=526.0s)]
*  We can take you now to Gia Ghol, one of our colleagues from BBC Persian, who is in Jerusalem for us. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=528.0s)]
*  Gia, just update us on what is happening in terms of damage to infrastructure, people killed in Iran today. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=533.0s)]
*  Well, Lucy, as we talk right now, I am receiving messages from Tehran. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=544.0s)]
*  They say they can see a plume of smoke in the center of Tehran in the West. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=549.0s)]
*  And also, during the day, the Israeli fighters have been pounding numbers of places in Tehran [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=554.0s)]
*  and encourage another city not far from Tehran, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=561.0s)]
*  a very strategic city in terms of industrial area and military compounds. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=564.0s)]
*  But it seems Israeli also last night have killed one of the top commander, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=569.0s)]
*  General Shadmone, who was the commander of Khatm al-Anbiya. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=575.0s)]
*  Khatm al-Anbiya is a branch and arm of Iranian Revolutionary Guards, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=579.0s)]
*  very powerful in terms of military economy and also in politics as well, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=583.0s)]
*  well linked with Iranian supreme leader. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=588.0s)]
*  He was killed and he's killing, posing this question. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=591.0s)]
*  Of course, Israelis say they have killed him, but Iranians have not confirmed this yet. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=595.0s)]
*  But what we are hearing right now in Iran, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=599.0s)]
*  the government has been asking the personal protection units of the officials, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=602.0s)]
*  do not carry device which connect to the net. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=607.0s)]
*  They are afraid there might be electronic surveillance [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=611.0s)]
*  or at least we know that killing a general with a high position, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=614.0s)]
*  just five days ago his predecessor was killed, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=619.0s)]
*  certainly Iranian are worried the Israeli agent may have infiltrated or spying on them. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=623.0s)]
*  That's why they knew exactly where he was and they may have taken him out. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=629.0s)]
*  And do you have the fear this is causing amongst Iranians at the moment, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=634.0s)]
*  particularly with President Trump also sort of saying people in Tehran have to evacuate? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=639.0s)]
*  What sort of stories are you hearing from people there as they try to leave Tehran with their families? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=645.0s)]
*  You know, there's often no fuel as well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=652.0s)]
*  What sort of stories are you hearing? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=654.0s)]
*  Lucy, the population of Tehran is, if you count the surrounding area, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=656.0s)]
*  weighs more than the population entire Israel. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=661.0s)]
*  And just imagine the entire country has to leave their homes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=664.0s)]
*  And even if they want to leave their homes, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=668.0s)]
*  it takes time with their cars and get out of the city. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=671.0s)]
*  I am hearing from people, they say we have a sick people at home. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=674.0s)]
*  We don't have a shelter. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=677.0s)]
*  And obviously Iranian government have a thought about this day. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=679.0s)]
*  They haven't built shelter. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=682.0s)]
*  And so many people are worried if this kind of attack happened, they might be hit. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=683.0s)]
*  Many people have a loved one in the prison. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=688.0s)]
*  They think if the prisons are being hit, those people have nowhere to go. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=691.0s)]
*  And we hear this kind of story over and over again. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=697.0s)]
*  And many people are angry with the government. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=701.0s)]
*  They say this is not their fight. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=703.0s)]
*  This is the government war. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=705.0s)]
*  This is the war of the people. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=707.0s)]
*  This is not their fight. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=709.0s)]
*  This is the government war they impose on the country. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=710.0s)]
*  And so many people are angry with the economic situation, with inflation. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=714.0s)]
*  That's why I think the Israeli government think by attacking Iranian security forces, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=719.0s)]
*  by attacking revolutionary guards, intelligence service, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=725.0s)]
*  which they have a pivotal role in suppressing and oppressing the protests in the past, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=728.0s)]
*  they might create an environment for Iranian people to rise up. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=733.0s)]
*  And I think this kind of problem, for example, the banking system was disrupted. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=737.0s)]
*  It was hacked. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=741.0s)]
*  Even some of the gas station pumps didn't work. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=742.0s)]
*  Electronic one, there was a problem. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=745.0s)]
*  And I think these kind of psychological war could agitate people. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=747.0s)]
*  And I think Israeli hope people rise up and topple the government [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=753.0s)]
*  without sending any troops underground. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=757.0s)]
*  Gio, really good to get your thoughts. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=760.0s)]
*  We're just going to leave you for a moment to listen in to Gideon Sa'a, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=761.0s)]
*  who is Israel's foreign minister speaking at the site of a strike in Roshon Lezion. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=765.0s)]
*  He's taking questions from the media, speaking in English now. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=771.0s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=774.0s)]
*  Is it regime change, as many are suggesting now? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=775.0s)]
*  We have very clear goals. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=777.0s)]
*  First of all, to severely damage the nuclear program. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=781.0s)]
*  We hadn't finished with that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=785.0s)]
*  We still have objectives. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=787.0s)]
*  We still have targets that now we can target easily [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=789.0s)]
*  because our air force now can relatively fly freely there, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=794.0s)]
*  and we still have objectives. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=802.0s)]
*  Secondly, to severely damage the ballistic missile program of the Iranian regime. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=805.0s)]
*  And thirdly, to severely damage the plan to eliminate the state of Israel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=811.0s)]
*  Regime change is not an objective of this war. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=817.0s)]
*  It can be a result, but it's not an objective we put to ourselves in this war. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=822.0s)]
*  The Iranian regime has done terrible things, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=828.0s)]
*  but many would say that Israel is the real international pariah accused of genocide [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=830.0s)]
*  in the International Court of Justice. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=836.0s)]
*  Your prime minister wanted on war crimes allegations by the International Criminal Court. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=838.0s)]
*  These ridiculous allegations were already thrown by the appeal after we appealed [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=843.0s)]
*  because this ridiculous court and corrupted court never even discussed the issue of jurisdiction, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=856.0s)]
*  for example, because they don't have any authority over Israel. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=867.0s)]
*  We are not a member state in the ICC. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=872.0s)]
*  We will allow others. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=875.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=877.0s)]
*  Is the target of Israel? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=878.0s)]
*  I know it is strange, but we never say time ahead who is an objective, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=880.0s)]
*  who is not. Every civilian, innocent civilians, are not the targets. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=891.0s)]
*  But you saw this morning we woke up and we heard that the commander of Iran in this war took out, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=898.0s)]
*  after we took out the first one. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=912.0s)]
*  So I will commend to the next online that will be offered the job not to respond positively very quickly. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=915.0s)]
*  Minister Zahar? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=924.0s)]
*  Next question. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=925.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=926.0s)]
*  Winston Marshall, British independent journalist. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=927.0s)]
*  When Iran launched their missiles in April 2024, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=929.0s)]
*  the British Royal Air Force were a part of the assistance to Israel in taking down those missiles and drones. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=934.0s)]
*  The Times of London have reported that the British government were not informed about Operation Rising Line. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=940.0s)]
*  What changed in relations between Israel and Britain in that time? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=948.0s)]
*  What do we expect about future relations between the two countries? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=953.0s)]
*  I can only comment on behalf of the Israeli government and the Israeli people. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=956.0s)]
*  You must ask this question to the British government. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=962.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=966.0s)]
*  Can I ask a question? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=967.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=968.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=969.0s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=970.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=971.0s)]
*  Patricia Gallardo from El Informador in Mexico. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=972.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you how many missiles have been launched since Friday, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=976.0s)]
*  that was the start of the operation, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=981.0s)]
*  and how many missiles have landed in Israel and how many have been stopped by the Iron Gump? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=983.0s)]
*  We have, I cannot give you now the accurate number, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=990.0s)]
*  but certainly hundreds, certainly hundreds of missiles. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=993.0s)]
*  We knew when we decided on Thursday night, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=998.0s)]
*  this historic decision that we will face damages, that we will face casualties, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1003.0s)]
*  but we also knew that there is a price not taking that decision. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1009.0s)]
*  And that decision was taken in the last possible moment, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1016.0s)]
*  a decision which is crucial to ensure the future and the security of the State of Israel. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1020.0s)]
*  Next question. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1027.0s)]
*  Can I ask you, as Julian Bort of the Guardian, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1028.0s)]
*  you said the third objective is to get rid of the plan, Iran's plan to... [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1030.0s)]
*  Severely damage Iran's eliminations plan. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1035.0s)]
*  So how do you do that without changing the regime? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1039.0s)]
*  We are doing that gradually. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1041.0s)]
*  First, we cut the hands of the octopus when we dealt with Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1045.0s)]
*  Now we are dealing with the head of the octopus. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1051.0s)]
*  We are dealing with the most significant threats, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1054.0s)]
*  and there are the ballistic threats and the nuclear threat, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1057.0s)]
*  and those threats are combined with their allies to the Iranian axis. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1061.0s)]
*  And while we are taking this operation, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1067.0s)]
*  we are no doubt getting a progress in achieving this objective. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1071.0s)]
*  Next question. Yes. Other questions? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1077.0s)]
*  Minister, one IDS question. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1079.0s)]
*  You already have one? Yes, please. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1081.0s)]
*  I am from Mexico City. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1083.0s)]
*  What is your message to all the people in Israel and the sufferings [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1086.0s)]
*  that feel the grief of being denied by the DNE? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1089.0s)]
*  We are facing difficult days, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1094.0s)]
*  but the people of Israel support this operation [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1098.0s)]
*  because the people of Israel totally understand [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1102.0s)]
*  it is vital to ensure the future of these states. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1105.0s)]
*  So I am saying to them we will face these difficult days, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1110.0s)]
*  we will face these casualties as well, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1114.0s)]
*  but we will ensure the future of the state of Israel for a very, very long time. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1118.0s)]
*  Thank you everyone. Thank you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1124.0s)]
*  That's Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'a. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1127.0s)]
*  He's at the site of a missile strike there in Rishon Le Zion, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1129.0s)]
*  which is a coastal city. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1133.0s)]
*  It's just south of Tel Aviv, right near Ben Gurion Airport. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1136.0s)]
*  Just talking about the clear goals and objectives of what Israel is trying to do in Iran [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1139.0s)]
*  to severely damage their ballistic missiles and nuclear program [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1143.0s)]
*  and their plans to eliminate Israel, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjrug1Ciso&t=1147.0s)]
