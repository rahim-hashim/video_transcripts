# How Vera Wang launched a fashion empire at 40 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo)
*  honestly felt sorry for them because they were living a great life but I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=0.0s)]
*  living a love. I was living a passion. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=6.98s)]
*  I love your life, Vera, because there are eras of Vera Wang and before there was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=14.84s)]
*  the person I grew up knowing, I didn't even realize this and I don't think many [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=22.72s)]
*  people do. You were a figure skater. How did you get into figure skating? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=27.84s)]
*  My father, this sounds very very cliche, but he bought me a pair of ice skates [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=34.08s)]
*  from a toy shop for Christmas and he took me to the Han 72nd Street in Central [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=41.76s)]
*  Park which froze over. Used to freeze over and he had skated in China. Believe [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=50.16s)]
*  it or not, my father figure skated in China when he was in the army. Is that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=57.28s)]
*  insane? And he sort of bought me these skates and I got on the lake and I just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=62.32s)]
*  felt free. It was just one of the most extraordinary feelings I'd ever had. I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=69.12s)]
*  mean I roller skated a little bit but this was a whole different, a whole [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  different feeling and it happened right in the middle of New York City right off [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=79.44s)]
*  Fifth Avenue. So there were, you know, the buildings and everything was just sort of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  a surreal moment and I fell in love with it and I just wanted to learn more about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  it. So being good parents, they really looked into everything they could at [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  that time. There weren't a lot of figure skaters around in New York City, let [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  alone Chinese-American-born figure skaters, so it was kind of rare. But I [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=104.64s)]
*  really did do everything I could to skate. I loved it so much that I would travel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  to the Port Authority bus terminal after school at four, travel an hour and a half, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=117.08s)]
*  walk four blocks to a dreadful rink in West New York and skate for two hours and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=122.08s)]
*  come back on the Port Authority bus and then study and, you know, try to get ready [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=128.68s)]
*  for school the next day. You wanted to join the Olympic team. I did. You didn't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=134.56s)]
*  make the team in 68 for the French Olympics. I failed, yes. How much of a blow was it to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=140.56s)]
*  you? Having worked, I mean, it just seems to me that everything you do, Vera, you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=145.96s)]
*  throw yourself into 300 percent and you'd thrown yourself into figure skating. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  How much was a blow? And it doesn't always work out. I think that sort of the real [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=153.84s)]
*  metaphor for my life has been that some of the things I've adored the most, and by [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=158.84s)]
*  that I mean passionately loved, are not deals that I've necessarily really [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  succeeded at. I mean, for a figure skater, particularly from a Chinese American [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=172.6s)]
*  family, education was everything. And the fact that I just wanted to skate and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  didn't want to go to school, that didn't really fly, so I sort of had to maintain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  my grades and fit skating in. Somehow fit that kind of discipline in. So I did [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=188.16s)]
*  whatever I had to do to do it. And I think that when you don't make the team [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=196.4s)]
*  and you've given up, I mean, I used to wake up at 4 a.m. in the summer from June [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=202.8s)]
*  through August. And I would think, what are all my classmates in the Hamptons [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=208.6s)]
*  doing? They've been out and they've been partying and they're asleep and they're [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=212.96s)]
*  going to go to a beach club for lunch and then they're going to play some tennis [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=219.44s)]
*  late in the afternoon. But by 12, I'd skated already seven hours. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=223.68s)]
*  That's what you were going to do. At that stage in your life, that's what you were [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=227.72s)]
*  going to do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=231.96s)]
*  And I actually honestly felt sorry for them because they were living a great life, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=232.24s)]
*  but I was living a love. I was living a passion. And that's a very different way to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=237.24s)]
*  live. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=245.72s)]
*  So when you didn't make the team in 68, how much of a... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=247.36s)]
*  I had a nervous breakdown. I was just going to Sarah Lawrence and I went there to study [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=250.36s)]
*  drama and I realized there weren't going to be a lot of roles for an Asian actress. And [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=257.2s)]
*  I dropped out after the first year and I switched over to art history. And I think that for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=265.2s)]
*  me that was probably the real turning point in my life. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=272.28s)]
*  So tell me about Paris because you go to Paris... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=277.2s)]
*  Paris. Lots of times in Paris. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=280.56s)]
*  And you'd been there since you were young. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=285.48s)]
*  But you chose Paris. Why not Rome or London? What was it about Paris that drew you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=286.08s)]
*  I think when I was very young I went there with my parents on a holiday. And I remember [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=292.08s)]
*  my father bought me these gray patent leather shoes, little Mary James. And I'd seen black [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=297.08s)]
*  in New York. And I think it was about 10 or 9. And I'd never seen shoes that color in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Mary James. And charcoal gray patent leather. And I just, my God, and it was raining. I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=311.24s)]
*  looked down at my shoes on the rain and there was something so beautiful and magical about [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=317.24s)]
*  the rain on the sidewalk. And I just said, this is such a beautiful place. And I wanted [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=325.0s)]
*  to come back. In fact, I wanted to be ambassador. There's a picture of me in front of Versailles [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=332.04s)]
*  as probably a 7 or 8 year old with those caps we used to wear and the double button coats [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=337.92s)]
*  and velvet collar. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=343.56s)]
*  And I hope you're a little gray Mary James. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm in my gray Mary James and I'm standing there with my little socks and I'm saying, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=347.08s)]
*  well I will be an ambassador here one day. And I didn't even know what ambassador was. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=351.08s)]
*  But I just really fell in love with Paris. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=356.32s)]
*  Your mother sounds impossibly chic. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=359.44s)]
*  She was. It's true. I mean a lot of people say as designers that they worked in their [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=363.76s)]
*  mother's kitchen or their mother inspired them or they came to it through their mother's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=371.76s)]
*  love of fashion. But my mother really was a clothes horse, I have to say. It's very [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=377.96s)]
*  rare to be that tall at that era. I mean she was about 5'7". And she wore clothes so beautifully [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=383.76s)]
*  and so neatly. The way she put clothes together, it was, I just marveled at her every day. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=392.88s)]
*  Just looking at her. It didn't have to be dressy. It could have been just a pair of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=400.56s)]
*  pants. There's a cider that could have been Catherine Hepburn and there was a cider that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=404.36s)]
*  could have been Audrey Hepburn. So she really had a sense of style that was very unique. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=409.56s)]
*  I think it came out of the frustration of her era of not being able to work and not [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=415.36s)]
*  being able to express herself and her creativity. I do believe that. And so she did it on herself. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=421.64s)]
*  She never had a career. She raised us, which is a career in itself. But she never had a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=428.88s)]
*  chance to express herself artistically. She was a pianist but not really the way she really [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=434.88s)]
*  wanted to live. I think it was impossible. We forget. I am that generation that crossed [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=442.52s)]
*  over from there to what women are capable of today. It's still not enough but it's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=447.56s)]
*  definitely not what I grew up around. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=453.76s)]
*  I think, you know, so I get frustrated at how many barriers we still haven't gone through. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=455.64s)]
*  There are not enough of us in senior positions, whether it's in the business world or in politics. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=461.4s)]
*  And ceilings. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=466.08s)]
*  And so many ceilings. But then I look back at my mother's generation and your mother's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=466.96s)]
*  generation and how hard it was for them and how much bottled up creativity and wasted [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=470.84s)]
*  talent there was. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=479.08s)]
*  And it must have been so frustrating to the point where they were relegated to living [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=480.08s)]
*  such a limited life in terms of self-expression. And that's why I think so many of them put [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=486.44s)]
*  hopes on their children and they were able to transfer that to their girls or their sons. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  I definitely lived a life she could never have lived. That's very true. And when I think [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=501.84s)]
*  back on it, it does make me sad because she was one of the most creative people I've ever [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=507.84s)]
*  met. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  You're in Paris and you meet an editor of French Vogue and then you come back to New [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=514.92s)]
*  York and you meet a very storied editor in New York as well. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=520.28s)]
*  Yes, Frances Stein. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=524.68s)]
*  Who said to you what when you were interested in fashion? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, in order to earn pocket money in the summer, I was sales assistant and I declared [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=529.72s)]
*  the windows at Selenwell. And this one woman came in and she said, I helped her, and she [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=538.0s)]
*  said when you graduate from college, please call me. I'm going to make you an editor of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  Vogue. And I sort of felt like Lana Turner in LA when she's sitting on that stool in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  that famous ice cream parlor or whatever. And I felt discovered. I didn't even know [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  what an editor really was. I didn't really understand. And she said, call me. So I called [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=563.0s)]
*  my mother and I said, this woman wants me to call her when I finish college next year. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  My mother said, she's never going to call you. It's never going to happen. She's just [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=574.5999999999999s)]
*  being nice. And I said, okay. So when I finished Sarah Lawrence, I did call her. And she remembered [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=578.88s)]
*  me and she said, come right in. I couldn't believe my first day at Vogue, I was in shock. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=585.88s)]
*  You were the youngest editor at Vogue. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=592.24s)]
*  I was the youngest, probably, woman to ever be given the title of editor. Yes. Probably [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=593.8s)]
*  to this day. And I did that for nearly 18, almost 19 years straight. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=601.94s)]
*  What made you leave Vogue and go to Ralph Lauren? What was the timing there when you [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=608.3s)]
*  decided to? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=614.6s)]
*  I always had a feeling I wanted to be a designer. I felt I had, I did not go to design school. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=615.6s)]
*  I didn't go to FIT or Schombol Sunday College. I didn't go to any of those places. But I [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=621.62s)]
*  had more experience with clothing firsthand than probably most students will ever have [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=627.38s)]
*  in their life. I mean, I wore it. I sell it on myself. I sell it at Vogue. And I really [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=631.5s)]
*  felt I had this dream. And my father said, if you think you can really be in fashion, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=640.74s)]
*  prove it, get a job. So I went to Vogue. And then after a certain amount of years, I said [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=647.94s)]
*  to him, well, it's now been almost 20 years. Do you think he would back me with a company? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=654.74s)]
*  And he said, well, not really, because he'd only worked in a magazine. So why don't you [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=661.6600000000001s)]
*  try working in a fashion company? So I went to Ralph Lauren. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=667.34s)]
*  So after a couple of years, you leave Ralph. Yes. And finally, your dad says, I got engaged. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=673.58s)]
*  That's why I left. That's why you left. And your dad says, okay, now he gives you his [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=679.3000000000001s)]
*  backing. Yeah, he does. But I'm 40. Yeah, it's not that young. And I didn't think it [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=683.9000000000001s)]
*  was old. But I actually wasn't sure. I mean, you've done your time. I wasn't even sure [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=689.6600000000001s)]
*  I really wanted to work in fashion anymore. At that point, I had very intense jobs, huge [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=694.34s)]
*  responsibility. And anyone who knows, knows the hours. There are no hours. And also, I [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=701.22s)]
*  think when you work for those companies, it is not about you. It is about them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  So when you went to set up your own company, how... You were tired. You were tired. So [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=714.38s)]
*  you set up a global... I was so tired. And I really wasn't even going to get married. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=721.1s)]
*  And I mean, I didn't get married until I was just shy in my 40th. And I really wanted a [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=725.14s)]
*  family. And I think as it turned out, I got married and I wanted the kids to have a family. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=731.38s)]
*  And then looking for the wedding gown is what started this. But I never looked at a wedding [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=741.78s)]
*  gown in my life before that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=746.98s)]
*  Did you have an image in your mind even then of, right, this is the wedding dress that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=748.62s)]
*  Vera won once for herself? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=752.94s)]
*  No, because I wasn't really even thinking of getting married. So it was really not something [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=754.82s)]
*  that occurred. As I went on my study, I went in Paris, I went in London, I went to see [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=760.3000000000001s)]
*  the manuals. I did not them themselves, but I shopped the manuals. Victor Edelstein, a [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=765.1400000000001s)]
*  lot of the very big British designers at that time. And finally, I just had two dresses [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=770.6600000000001s)]
*  And then another two by Scasi. And I have to be really honest. I mean, my husband said [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=778.58s)]
*  to me, please don't come in fashion. Please look like a bride. Don't come in yoji, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=786.6600000000001s)]
*  Don't come in black. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=795.6600000000001s)]
*  Don't come in black. And he said, I look at pictures, I want to make sure you look like [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=797.22s)]
*  a bride. So that's who really influenced me, my choice. I mean, it was fine. It was [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=801.54s)]
*  very bridal. But I did change. I got to change, you know, because in Chinese culture, you [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=808.9s)]
*  change from the Western dress, Chinese dress. But I changed into a party dress for afterwards. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=816.9s)]
*  I just started a train way back in 1989 to change. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=822.4599999999999s)]
*  When you started your business, did you have a concept of what a Vera Wang wedding dress [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=827.5s)]
*  was going to look like? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=834.62s)]
*  No, none whatsoever. I mean, I have to be honest, my father recognized the market. When [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=836.26s)]
*  he saw that it was underserved, he said, you should do bridal, because you do fashion. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=841.6s)]
*  And I said, oh, I don't know. And he said, no, you should do it. There's very little [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=848.6s)]
*  fabric inventory. There's very little inventory, period, because you don't keep dresses in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  every size. And he said, it's limited, and it's controllable. And from a financial point [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=861.7s)]
*  of view, it doesn't require an enormous initial investment. He was a businessman. And I said, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=868.98s)]
*  but I don't know if I want to do this. And he said, well, you need some more freedom [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=875.98s)]
*  for your life. You've had no freedom your whole life. And then when I started my business, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=881.38s)]
*  I really wasn't free. After that, I mean, it made everything else look like a vacay. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=888.58s)]
*  Pretty much. And I can say that I had pretty intense jobs. Both jobs were intense. And [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=898.02s)]
*  then from there, just, we opened a store, and my first client was Ethel Kennedy. I mean, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=906.02s)]
*  her son Max was getting married and marrying a beautiful girl who was a law student. And [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=915.14s)]
*  I spent eight months on that dress. And within 10 minutes of the ceremony, she was out kicking [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=923.66s)]
*  a football with the Kennedy brothers, because they love to play football. I said, what do [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=931.1s)]
*  we work on the dress? The flowers at the bottom of this dress is covered in grass stains. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=935.5s)]
*  I mean, it was crazy. But among my biggest first clients were the Kennedys. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=940.78s)]
*  You've done so much, and you're still doing so much. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I kind [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=945.9s)]
*  of felt like I was in a rush. I thought, I don't know, I had this idea that life was [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=954.66s)]
*  going to stop at 50 or something, or my work was going to stop at 50, or 40 even. I just [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=959.06s)]
*  thought I didn't have a very long runway. You've proved that the runway for women is [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  so long, and you can keep evolving and keep doing new things. And do you think, would [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=969.2199999999999s)]
*  you say to younger women today that they have time, that they can do? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=975.9s)]
*  I do think that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=982.26s)]
*  I don't know what that message is for younger women, but there's something for younger women [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=982.78s)]
*  there. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=986.2199999999999s)]
*  To be honest to you, what you said was true. Women were considered transparent at a certain [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=986.42s)]
*  age, even in terms of their careers. I mean, you'll age out of a career. I don't just mean [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=993.9799999999999s)]
*  modeling. I don't just mean being an editor. My father said, choose a career where you [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1001.02s)]
*  don't feel old by 25. He actually wanted me to go to law school. And you gain more respect, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1006.78s)]
*  and you're not fighting time. You're gaining respect. And the more years you put in, the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1013.98s)]
*  more respect you're going to generate. And that sort of stayed with me, but I did not [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1022.86s)]
*  grow up in a youth-obsessed culture. If you were born in 1949 like me, it was four years [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1028.1399999999999s)]
*  after World War II ended in Europe. I mean, 1945, I was born in 1949. I mean, the French, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1034.06s)]
*  everybody's obsessed with World War II. All the films were about World War II. And I think [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1042.06s)]
*  that the fact I wasn't obsessed by it, because I was busy and I thought productive and I [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1047.06s)]
*  loved what I was doing, you don't focus on that as much. And we didn't have social media, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1054.46s)]
*  and everybody didn't age right before your very eyes, and everybody wasn't critical. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1061.74s)]
*  It was really more about finding a way, what you wanted to do, whether you wanted to be [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1067.54s)]
*  the best parent that ever lived, the best brown bagged lunches, the best cupcakes, the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1072.94s)]
*  best library drive, the best security patrol. I mean, you didn't, whatever life you chose, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1078.42s)]
*  I didn't see that obsession with aging that I have felt the last two decades. And I've [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1086.1s)]
*  seen people that are so young, which is what is shocking to me. I am never dressed to try [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1094.1s)]
*  to be young. I've dressed in my own style since I was an editor. And people who've known [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1100.4199999999998s)]
*  me that long know that I've always been experimental. I've always mixed athleisure, where one thing [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1105.4199999999998s)]
*  meant athleisure. I mixed leggings with, you know, a Kenzo shearling jacket with an Agnes [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1112.4199999999998s)]
*  B. T-shirt. I mean, I always was a stylist, basically. And I think that I don't feel, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1119.14s)]
*  however I am now, that I should stop being creative in how I dress myself, but also what [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1129.58s)]
*  I create for others. I just feel it's not about age, it's about style. And that's always [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1138.02s)]
*  how I felt. I never not felt that way. And I just see that whatever you choose to be, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1145.18s)]
*  if it works out for your lifestyle, it's relevant and it's balanced. Not everyone wears the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1150.82s)]
*  same clothes because they don't live the same lifestyle. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1157.82s)]
*  Do you think it's something that, when you talk to young designers in their 20s and early [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1160.5s)]
*  30s, do you think it's something they appreciate? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1167.58s)]
*  I don't know if it's that they're thinking of. I think it's so competitive. And I think [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1171.86s)]
*  they're just trying to somehow be noticed that whatever they create, that someone cares, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1178.2199999999998s)]
*  that they can find their audience or people that believe in them. I mean, it was a smaller [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1185.6999999999998s)]
*  industry before. And now it's global. And now it's everywhere. And now it's on a phone. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  And much more accessibility than it was. But at the same time, it's much harder for young [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1199.38s)]
*  designers because they don't have that limitation. They're competing against so many other, I [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1204.94s)]
*  mean, visions and ideas and countries and cultures and everything else. I mean, there [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1215.5s)]
*  are strong right talents coming out of China, Australia. I mean, it isn't just Paris, Milan, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1221.42s)]
*  New York and London. It isn't. It's LA. LA's an insane culture. I think LA's the best jeans, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1227.82s)]
*  jeans businesses in the world because that's so LA. So lifestyle has a lot to do with how [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1234.26s)]
*  you dress. You would look absurd in some things that you wear in New York and LA. You would [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1240.5s)]
*  feel ridiculous in the Hamptons and something that doesn't fit into a Hamptons lifestyle. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1246.5s)]
*  Geography, temperature, climate, lifestyle, they all have something to do with fashion. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1252.0600000000002s)]
*  To me, I mean, I'm not running around like this in the Hamptons. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1258.66s)]
*  You'd look fantastic. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1264.22s)]
*  I don't know if I look fantastic, but this would not be, you know, it'd be more shorts [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1265.22s)]
*  and a clog or something, t-shirts, a great sweater, that kind of thing. I think fashion [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1270.9s)]
*  is so specific and I think it's also so large. It's so big now. There's so many ways of looking [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1278.22s)]
*  at fashion and beauty and style and lifestyle and everything. And I think it's a great thing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1287.14s)]
*  It probably also can cause some confusion for people, but even someone as bedded or [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1295.0600000000002s)]
*  let's just say as old as me, I will sometimes buy things in London I would never wear in [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1302.94s)]
*  New York. And I used to make that mistake. I'd buy something in Paris. I'd say, God, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1308.06s)]
*  am I really running around in Kenzo Royal blue leather coat in the Vogue offices? But [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  that's part of the international quality of fashion, that when you're there, you're influenced [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1318.86s)]
*  by where you are. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1324.58s)]
*  If you're in Paris, you're feeling something different than London. If you're in London, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1325.62s)]
*  you're feeling something different than Shanghai. If you're in Shanghai, you're feeling something [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1329.14s)]
*  different from Hong Kong. And Miami, L.A., you're influenced by your environment. And [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1332.7800000000002s)]
*  I think that's something, that's very much a factor in fashion today. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1340.0200000000002s)]
*  Vera-Lynn, thank you very much. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkvH8tgINo&t=1345.5s)]
