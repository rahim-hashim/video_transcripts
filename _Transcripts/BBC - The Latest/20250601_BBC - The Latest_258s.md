# Gaza rescuers say at least 26 people killed after Israeli tanks open fire near aid centre | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo)
*  Next, reports from Gaza say at least 26 Palestinians have been killed and many more wounded after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli tank fire hit people near a US-funded aid distribution centre in the southern city [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=6.78s)]
*  of Ra'far. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=13.34s)]
*  In the last half an hour, we've had these pictures in from the area. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=14.74s)]
*  They show injured Palestinians being taken to the Nasser hospital in Haryounis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Many of the images we've seen show people with injuries which appear too graphic to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=24.32s)]
*  show. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=29.22s)]
*  A local journalist told the BBC thousands of people have gathered near the US-funded [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=30.22s)]
*  aid point when the Israeli tanks opened fire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=35.14s)]
*  There's been no comment yet from the Israeli army. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=38.34s)]
*  The incident comes hours after hopes for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=42.26s)]
*  Gaza again faded, with Hamas and Israel remaining at odds over the conditions of the latest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=47.32s)]
*  US-backed proposal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=53.18s)]
*  Hamas, which is a prescribed terror organisation in the US, UK and EU, repeated its demands [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=55.18s)]
*  for a permanent truce, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and guarantees for the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=61.26s)]
*  continuous flow of humanitarian aid. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=66.14s)]
*  None of these are in the deal on the table. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=69.14s)]
*  Our Middle East regional editor, Sebastian Usher, is in Jerusalem. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=72.02s)]
*  He told me what was known first about the incident at the aid distribution point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=76.42s)]
*  Well, the latest we're hearing as far as figures are concerned is from a Red Cross [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=82.18s)]
*  field hospital saying that at least 26 people have been killed and 150 wounded. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  The reports that we were getting earlier say that thousands of Palestinians are gathered [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=93.78s)]
*  near this aid distribution point in Ratha in the south of Gaza early in the morning, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=98.06s)]
*  around 4.30 in the morning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=104.34s)]
*  And medics, other local sources, say that Israeli tanks moved near and then opened fire [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=107.26s)]
*  and that that fire is what was responsible for the deaths and the injuries in the crowd. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=114.7s)]
*  We've seen pictures, again, harrowing images of dead and wounded Palestinians being taken [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=122.3s)]
*  on donkey carts to the nearest hospitals that are still functioning in order to receive [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=128.42s)]
*  treatment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=134.5s)]
*  We've cited the IDF for a statement, for a comment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=135.58s)]
*  We haven't yet heard back from them as to what happened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=137.98s)]
*  But this is another deadly incident, as we've seen over the past few days, as this new aid [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=141.66s)]
*  mechanism has begun to work in Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=146.54s)]
*  It is a US-funded group that is doing this rather than the UN and other aid agencies, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=151.62s)]
*  which has said that they don't want to be part of this initiative, which they see as [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=157.98s)]
*  not optimum for the needs of the people in Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=161.78s)]
*  And Israel was there to provide security, Israeli troops. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=165.86s)]
*  So this is another sign that that distribution mechanism doesn't seem to be working as everyone [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=170.34s)]
*  would have been hoping it would have done by now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=177.3s)]
*  And meanwhile, Hamas and Israel remain at odds over this latest US-backed proposal for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=180.18s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=185.5s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=188.5s)]
*  Hamas took a couple of days to deliver its response to the latest proposal, essentially [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=190.22s)]
*  mediated by the US envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=195.46s)]
*  Israel had already said that it had signed up and agreed to the deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=198.42s)]
*  Hamas essentially said that it had responded positively and responsibly, and that it wasn't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=202.18s)]
*  a rejection, but they then produced a breakdown of the conditions that they are asking, which [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=206.18s)]
*  is somewhat different from what we've seen as far as the proposal appears to have been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=211.74s)]
*  laid out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=217.54s)]
*  The key sticking point that there's been for so long in trying first to get that six-week [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire that did finally take place and to try and get another ceasefire in place [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=222.5s)]
*  since it collapsed is over Hamas's insistence that any ceasefire negotiations, any talks [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  once it is implemented should lead and should have guarantees right at the start to a total [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=233.26s)]
*  withdrawal of Israeli troops and a permanent end to the war in Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=239.26s)]
*  That's something that the Israeli government isn't ready to do as far as the situation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=243.42s)]
*  is at the moment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=247.94s)]
*  The pressure is certainly building on both sides to come to a compromise and to ensure [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=248.94s)]
*  that a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages does begin to take place. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebbZHtuXfo&t=253.62s)]
