# Esports World Cup: How Team Liquid and Levi de Weerd have prepared for the tournament | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs)
*  Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo probably felt pressure as well when they stepped onto the pitch, so same goes for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=0.0s)]
*  I think it's one of the most mental sports there is. Obviously sitting in your chair behind your console isn't that tough physically, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=5.36s)]
*  but mentally it's really draining, so I think you need to be ready for that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=13.4s)]
*  I'm going to assume that you're probably going to score again very soon because you're incredibly good at this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=16.44s)]
*  Hi, I'm Leif De Weert. I'm 21 years of age. I'm a AFC player or better called FIFA from back in the days for Team Liquid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Did you ever think that you'd be playing games professionally? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=28.040000000000003s)]
*  For a living, no. When I was younger I knew there was some money in the scene and I could maybe get some money from it, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=31.28s)]
*  whilst I not had to work in the supermarket. But as I started the years developed, the game has developed, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  I think eSports has developed and is still developing. So yeah, to be thinking before when I was younger that I was going to be in this position, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=44.92s)]
*  I would say no. I didn't think that it was possible, but when I started to grow up and got a bit older, I knew there was something in it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  So at some point I started to believe in it and I'm really grateful for the position I have right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  You're going to be walking out on one of the biggest stages for eSports in the world, the eSports World Cup. How are you feeling? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=67.0s)]
*  This is the biggest event of the year, not only for us as EFC players, I think for eSports organisations in general. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=72.56s)]
*  So yeah, obviously I'm feeling buzzing to play. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=78.8s)]
*  You're relatively new to Team Liquid and these facilities here. Why is this such a good place to train? Why is it important? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=81.28s)]
*  I think it's important to have a good environment with coaches, with players, with the staff behind the team. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=89.28s)]
*  So you get a good chemistry. Obviously, EFC is a 1-1 game, we don't play in a team, which you can still learn a lot from everyone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think in our team, we are all friends. So obviously you want yourself to perform best, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  but if you don't have the chance because you got knocked out, you want some other guys with the team to perform at their highest level. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  And I think training and preparation is everything. The level you have in a tournament is going to be decided the weeks and months before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=115.72s)]
*  So that's how I think about it. And I think Liquid shares the same idea. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=124.56s)]
*  We do everything to our capabilities to have the best performance possible at the EWC. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=129.0s)]
*  So we have a gameplay coach, which we have three at the moment. We're working with other players. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  We're analyzing games from tournaments in the past or friendly games where we try things out and see what works, what doesn't work. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=141.32s)]
*  We have performance coaches and mental coaches, which are helping us a lot in our head, which I think it's one of the most mental sports there is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=150.56s)]
*  Obviously sitting in your chair behind your console isn't that tough physically, but mentally it's really draining. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=159.16s)]
*  So I think you need to be ready for that. And that's what they're helping us with. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  Do they also prepare you for those moments when you're on the stage? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Because there's quite a lot of fans cheering you on. It's very different from playing in your living room. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=174.04s)]
*  Obviously they have to, because I would lie if I said that it doesn't do anything to you at all. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Obviously you feel nerves, you feel tense, but I think it's important to turn that into some motivation and a positive thing, because it's not something bad. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=183.64s)]
*  Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo probably felt pressure as well when they stepped onto the pitch. So same goes for us. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=193.64s)]
*  I think it helps us to concentrate and focus, or at least if I speak for myself. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=199.76s)]
*  So it obviously depends per person how you react to that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=203.6s)]
*  I think it's something you can learn and goes with experience. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=210.04s)]
*  And how much of a difference can it make the training that happens in the last few weeks beforehand? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=213.44s)]
*  Everything. Obviously the flow you have in the tournament is also really important. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=219.88s)]
*  I would say preparation is at least 50 percent, because if you don't have a good preparation, the tournament is not going to go how you want. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=225.68s)]
*  These big multi-esports competitions like the Esports World Cup, are they good for you as a player in terms of being amongst other esports players, maybe having more people watching? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=234.44s)]
*  I think it's something good for everyone involved, also because it improves the chemistry in the organisation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=245.92s)]
*  For example, the Dota players or Apex players or whatever, they might be watching us as well, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=252.4s)]
*  because we can finish first as a whole organisation or we can get a ranking as a whole organisation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=259.04s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not really into other games, but because of this tournament, we can finish first or second. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, we aim for first as Team Liquid was second already last year as an entire team. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=273.72s)]
*  So I think it's a special one because I've not seen a tournament before that's like this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  For me personally, I just want to get as much points on the board as possible for Liquid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=283.68s)]
*  Obviously, that will mean I perform good by myself as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=289.48s)]
*  So yeah, enough motivation to get the trophy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  The Esports World Cup has a massive prize pot and a lot of that money will go to the team that does the best. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=298.88s)]
*  Is there more pressure because of the money that the team could be getting? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=306.52s)]
*  I would not say more pressure because the pressure I put on myself is already there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=310.92s)]
*  So the prize money for me doesn't mean I get more pressure. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=317.52s)]
*  But I think you can notice in the organisation that it's a really big tournament. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=322.2s)]
*  So on the other hand, you know there's more attention on it, which maybe can cause pressure. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=327.0s)]
*  But I think I'm pretty cool in my head. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=333.12s)]
*  It won't really do too much to me and I hope I will not figure out something else. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=336.72s)]
*  But last year we were kind of in the same position. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=341.04s)]
*  We also represented Team Liquid. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  I didn't really feel more pressure in that tournament. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  So I think it will be the same this year. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=348.68s)]
*  So a lot of famous football players have their own celebrations. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  Do you have one when you score when you win? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  I do. I do. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  Can we see it? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  It's this one and it stands for something. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=359.68s)]
*  My first name is Leifi. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  So that's the first L. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=364.04s)]
*  And the other one is Jordan, which is a J and that's the name of my brother. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=365.32s)]
*  I love that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=370.08s)]
*  So wait, can you show us again? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=370.8s)]
*  It's this one. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=373.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=374.44s)]
*  Every time you score a goal or just when you win the whole thing? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=374.96s)]
*  I'm not really the person who celebrates every goal because you can get it back in your net [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=377.16s)]
*  straight away in a few seconds. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=381.52s)]
*  But if I win the whole thing, you will definitely see this one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=382.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=385.68s)]
*  Well, good luck. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=386.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=386.84s)]
*  And hopefully we do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=387.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPtvXVMoFRs&t=388.68s)]
