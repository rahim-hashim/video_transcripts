Video Description: Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams spoke about their unexpected nine month stay on the International Space Station (ISS).

The duo were scheduled to go to the ISS on 5 June 2024 for an eight day mission to test Boeing Starliner's capsule, but ended up staying for nine months after the spacecraft had technical problems.

The astronauts returned to Earth on 19 March aboard the SpaceX Dragon, which safely splashed down in the ocean off the coast of Florida.
