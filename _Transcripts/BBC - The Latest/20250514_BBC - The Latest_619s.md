Video Description: At least 50 people are reported to have been killed in Gaza in what local officials say were Israeli air strikes.
 
Israeli warplanes dropped six bombs simultaneously on the European Hospital in Khan Younis, a spokesman for the Hamas-run civil defence agency has said, killing 28.
 
The Israeli military said it had conducted a "precise strike" on "Hamas terrorists in a command and control centre" which it claimed was beneath the hospital.
 
There are also reports of numerous deaths at the Jabalia refugee camp which was hit overnight after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for the area.

# At least 50 killed after Israeli strikes on Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI)
*  We start in Gaza where more than 50 people are reported to have been killed in what local officials say were Israeli airstrikes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=0.0s)]
*  Many of the casualties were at a hospital compound in Qanunis, which the Hamas-run civil defence agency says was struck by several devices. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=7.0s)]
*  There are also reports of numerous deaths at the Jabalia refugee camp, which was hit overnight after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for the area. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=16.0s)]
*  Let's speak now to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega, who is in Jerusalem. Hugo, tell us more about what happened in Gaza overnight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, Karin, so it was a very violent night, particularly in the north of the territory with more than 50 people killed in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=35.0s)]
*  We've seen images of people searching through the rubble of collapsed buildings, retrieving bodies of people who were killed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=47.0s)]
*  Doctors are saying the children are among the victims. And you mentioned the attack that happened in Qanunis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=55.0s)]
*  28 people were killed in the attack that happened yesterday in the south of the territory. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=61.0s)]
*  Now this happens as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to expand the military offensive against Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=68.0s)]
*  He says that it is this kind of pressure that is going to force Hamas to negotiate a deal for the release of the hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=76.0s)]
*  This is a very controversial strategy. It is facing a growing opposition in Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=86.0s)]
*  Even the Trump administration is frustrated with the Prime Minister. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=92.0s)]
*  For a very long time, he's been accused of not being interested in reaching a deal with Hamas, of prolonging the war for political purposes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=96.0s)]
*  So we're now seeing these attacks in the last 24 hours. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=104.0s)]
*  About 100 people were killed in Gaza as a result of these attacks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=108.0s)]
*  And the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues, caused by this Israeli ban on the entry of basic supplies. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=113.0s)]
*  For more than 70 days, no aid has entered Gaza, with aid agencies warning of a catastrophic situation there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=120.0s)]
*  Hugo, thank you very much. Hugo Bashega in Jerusalem. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=128.0s)]
*  Well, as we were hearing as well as the Israeli strike on the European hospital, a second one was also hit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=132.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says it was targeting a Hamas command and control centre. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=138.0s)]
*  A freelance journalist who was filming for the BBC at the hospital was injured and is receiving medical attention. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=143.0s)]
*  This report from Fergal Kean contains distressing images. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=149.0s)]
*  They were waiting to evacuate sick children out of Gaza when the missile struck. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=154.0s)]
*  The Israelis allege the leader of Hamas was hiding in a command centre under the hospital. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=160.0s)]
*  An injured child. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=166.0s)]
*  Dozens are reported killed and wounded. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=171.0s)]
*  A BBC colleague was carrying out an interview when the rockets landed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=178.0s)]
*  Here he tries to comfort children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=182.0s)]
*  In terror they call out the prayer for the dead. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=186.0s)]
*  Our colleague was wounded, but not seriously. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=190.0s)]
*  For his safety we're not revealing his name. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=194.0s)]
*  Every day of this war he's captured its cruelty. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=198.0s)]
*  It was a very difficult time for the Israeli military. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=205.0s)]
*  It was he who filmed the story of Sihwar Asur, five months old and acutely malnourished. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=210.0s)]
*  Our cameraman saw her twice in the last few days. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=217.0s)]
*  Just before he was caught in the rocket attack he told me filming Sihwar was one of the most painful things I've ever had to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=221.0s)]
*  But today some better news. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=232.0s)]
*  Jordanian medics managed to get some milk formula to Mum Najwa. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=235.0s)]
*  But Sihwar's life is held by the most slender thread. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=239.0s)]
*  I wish she could receive the treatment she needs to recover fully. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=249.0s)]
*  She's my first child and as her mother I'm deeply heartbroken for her. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=254.0s)]
*  I truly hope someone can help save my daughter. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=260.0s)]
*  Some children have been evacuated here to neighbouring Jordan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=266.0s)]
*  In January we filmed the arrival of Abd al-Rahman and his mum Asma. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=277.0s)]
*  For four months they've lived in a place with food, a safe place. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=282.0s)]
*  Today when we visited Asma she called her children and their grandmother back in Gaza. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=288.0s)]
*  Here the agonising differences in the lives of one family. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=298.0s)]
*  The rockets are everywhere, firing over our heads. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=307.0s)]
*  The food, life is very bad. There is no flour. The prices are very high. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=311.0s)]
*  I don't know what to say. I'm very grateful for my mum, for all she's doing for me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=319.0s)]
*  I wish I could return back to find them safe and in good health. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=331.0s)]
*  It is only through a mother's eyes looking at her children trapped, hungry, in danger, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=337.0s)]
*  that we can imagine why anyone would want to return to Gaza. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=342.0s)]
*  Outside the blockade there are talks about a ceasefire, talks about allowing aid. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=346.0s)]
*  But for now just talks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=352.0s)]
*  Fergal Keen, BBC News, Amman. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=355.0s)]
*  Let's go to our Gaza correspondent Rushdie Abou al-Louf who is currently in Cairo, the Egyptian capital. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=359.0s)]
*  Rushdie, more than 70 days now of a total blockade of food and medicine into Gaza. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=365.0s)]
*  What are people doing to survive, to eat on a daily basis? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=372.0s)]
*  You know, very few items are still in the market, but with a very, very expensive, very, very high price. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=380.0s)]
*  I was talking to people the day the American Israeli soldier released from Gaza, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=387.0s)]
*  Elan Alexander, and this little window of hope seems to be fade away very quickly with the first Israeli airstrike in Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=393.0s)]
*  And since then, over 100 people were killed, including 40 only overnight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=403.0s)]
*  For more than 70 days, Israel did not allow any food, fuel or medicine into Gaza. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=409.0s)]
*  Most of the hospitals are struggling to cope with the number of injuries that they are receiving every day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=417.0s)]
*  Yesterday the hospital in Khan Younis Nasr Hospital was asking people to donate blood following the attack on the other hospital, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=424.0s)]
*  the European hospital, where about 28 people killed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=436.0s)]
*  The people are daily challenged to find water. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=440.0s)]
*  I was talking to people yesterday. They said they sometimes queue for six hours to get some uncleaned even water. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=444.0s)]
*  Fuel is not there anywhere. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=453.0s)]
*  And most of the essential operations, such as sewage system, water system, isn't functioning because there is no fuel to run this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=455.0s)]
*  And food, almost nothing is there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=466.0s)]
*  No fresh vegetables or fruit in Gaza, no meat or chicken. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=469.0s)]
*  People do live on very few items left, like lentil soup. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=474.0s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, I mean, one bag of flour would cost 400 US dollars in Gaza. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=480.0s)]
*  So it is almost close to a famine, the situation how the people are describing to me every day. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=488.0s)]
*  Rushdie, you talked of a brief raising of hopes earlier in the week with the release of that Israeli American hostage, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=496.0s)]
*  Edan Alexander. What prospects are there at the moment of something moving forward with regards to Gaza? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=503.0s)]
*  Donald Trump in the region, Donald Trump in Qatar later today? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=510.0s)]
*  Yes, I mean, from Hamas point of view, they said we give the maximum and we give what is shown or known as a present to President Donald Trump before he arrived to the area. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=514.0s)]
*  They said we give the Israeli American soldiers, Edan Alexander, and now it's time for the Americans to maintain pressure on Israel. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=531.0s)]
*  So will we understand from a senior Hamas official that as part of the deal, Israel will allow or should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=540.0s)]
*  And this is what the people were expecting. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=553.0s)]
*  We have seen like hundreds of people celebrating that day only because they were heard from Hamas and other sources that Israel would allow aid in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=556.0s)]
*  For now, we understand that yesterday, Israeli delegation arrived in Doha and conducted talks with the Qataris. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=567.0s)]
*  We understand also that here in Egypt, Egyptian mediators are involved in the area. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=576.0s)]
*  They try to use this, what they call, one of the Egyptians told me, a hysterical moment of Trump in the area to try and push for a bigger deal to renew the ceasefire. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=581.0s)]
*  But so far, it doesn't seem that there is any progress. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=594.0s)]
*  The only sound that we heard from Gaza is the sound of airstrikes, over 10 or 15 airstrikes in the last 24 hours. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=598.0s)]
*  And over 100 people were killed according to Hamas' own civil defence. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=606.0s)]
*  Only 40 people in northern Gaza since like a few hours. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=611.0s)]
*  Okay, Rushdie, thank you very much. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gns3xdQ12HI&t=617.0s)]
