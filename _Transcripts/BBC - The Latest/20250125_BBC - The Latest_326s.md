# Israel releases 200 Palestinian prisoners as part of ceasefire deal | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs)
*  Part of the agreement, 200 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli jails. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=0.0s)]
*  Just seeing from Egypt, state-linked media there saying 70 of those free Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=5.36s)]
*  have arrived in Egypt. A large number of the others are going to the West Bank and our [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=11.76s)]
*  correspondent John Donason is in Ramallah. Just describe the scenes to us, John. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=16.64s)]
*  Well, you can see the three prison buses behind me. About 20 minutes ago, those buses arrived [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=23.28s)]
*  and frankly pretty chaotic scenes as the prisoners got off. A very large crowd and we saw the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=29.04s)]
*  prisoners in their grey prison fatigues, many of them with shaved heads, long beards, a lot of them [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=34.4s)]
*  looking pretty thin, it has to be said, hoisted onto the shoulders, carried into the sports complex [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=40.56s)]
*  behind me. You can just see one now emerging there. A man in his 40s, I'd say, maybe his 50s, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  being carried out with a shaven head and when they arrived, you know, the scramble [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=52.72s)]
*  to get to their loved ones, I just saw one prisoner coming out on the shoulders and what looked to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=59.44s)]
*  his young son was hoisted up and put into his arms. Now, the big difference in this prisoner [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=64.88s)]
*  exchange this week compared to last week is the people released today, many of them had been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=70.4s)]
*  convicted of much more serious offences including murder, killing Israeli civilians. Now, those [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=76.24s)]
*  convicted of the most serious offences and I think there were 121 of the 200 serving life sentences, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=82.4s)]
*  they're going to be taken to Egypt as you say, they're there already and they're going to be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=89.2s)]
*  deported to countries including Qatar and Turkey. So the people here, and I think there's about 100 [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  or so who've been brought here today, they will be allowed to return to their families, their homes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=99.28s)]
*  in the West Bank, many of them have been in prison for years and it's really a big moment [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=105.44s)]
*  for Palestinians here. The prisoner issue is a massive one, most families in the West Bank will [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=112.0s)]
*  have had a family member or a friend who's been held in Israeli prison at some point and you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=117.28s)]
*  these images today has to be said, Hamas will make hay from them because they'll say look, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=124.16s)]
*  we are the force that is getting our prisoners out. Just describe to our audience around the world, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  A, how many Palestinian prisoners are held in Israeli jails and B, how many do we expect [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=138.24s)]
*  to be released as part of this hostage release deal? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, there are thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails from a whole range of offences. As [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=152.08s)]
*  I say, every family probably has a member who at some point has been in an Israeli prison. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  In the past 15 months, there have been, and you can just see another prisoner coming out here [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=164.72s)]
*  with the kefir. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=170.32s)]
*  He's just coming past, being carried on down through the crowd with the Palestinian kefir [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=175.76s)]
*  scarf on, the scarf that Yasser Arafat, the former Palestinian leader, was very well known for and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=182.56s)]
*  going back to that question, thousands of Palestinians have been arrested just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  in the past 15 months across the West Bank and also detained from Gaza. In this first phase of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=195.28s)]
*  the deal, the first six-week phase, we are expecting another 1,600 Palestinian prisoners to be brought [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=202.96s)]
*  out. Some more are now just emerging. 1,600 more to come in the next six weeks, including the most [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=210.0s)]
*  high-profile prisoners, those convicted of the most serious offences. And John, we mentioned that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=217.12s)]
*  this is the first phase of the three phases of this ceasefire and prisoner swap deal. What is the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=222.88s)]
*  mood in the West Bank about hopes for all three stages passing off and us getting to the end of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=231.6s)]
*  the process? Well, a few things. First of all, there's huge relief that there is some [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=239.76s)]
*  sort of ceasefire, albeit perhaps temporary in Gaza. There is celebration and relief that these [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=247.28s)]
*  prisoners are coming out today. But overall, I would say there is absolutely zero sense of optimism [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  that this decades-long conflict is anywhere near to coming to an end. You know, Palestinians here [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=261.36s)]
*  in the West Bank feel like they're being squeezed like never before. They've seen a rise in attacks [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=267.76s)]
*  by Jewish settlers in the West Bank. They've seen a rise in Israeli operations targeting militants [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=273.44s)]
*  in the West Bank. Just this week in Jenin, right in the north of the West Bank, we saw a large [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=280.24s)]
*  Israeli military operation which killed, I think, at least 13 Palestinians. And the past 15 months [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=286.48s)]
*  in the West Bank, although overshadowed by events in Gaza, has been the most deadly, the most violent [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=292.96s)]
*  in decades. So, you know, there is absolutely no real prospect of peace here. And we sometimes hear [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=299.44s)]
*  international political leaders saying, you know, the next stage is rebuilding Gaza and a two-state [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=308.32s)]
*  solution, a Palestinian state living side by side with an Israeli state. But the truth is, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=315.12s)]
*  you know, there's no optimism that that's coming anytime soon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcks9LPq4Vs&t=322.8s)]
