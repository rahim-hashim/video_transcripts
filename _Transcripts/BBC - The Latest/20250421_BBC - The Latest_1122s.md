Video Description: Tributes have been paid around the world to Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday.  The Vatican said he died following a stroke, less than 24 hours after appearing in a wheelchair at St Peter's Square to lead an Easter address in front of thousands of worshipers.

Services have been held around the world as around 1.4bn Catholics begin to mark the Pope's death.  

Cardinal Kevin Farrell said the pope had "returned to the home of the Father…. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised."

The Vatican said Francis died after suffering a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure.

Francis will lie in state in St Peter's Basilica, where mourners will be able to attend to pay their respects, before a funeral is held, which usually takes place within four to six days after a Pope dies.  The Pope requested that some elements of the elaborate death rites which usually take place after a pontiff's death be dispensed with, including using an ornate coffin and displaying his body on a raised platform.

In his final testament, released by the Vatican late on Monday, he asked to be buried in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Many of his predecessors instead chose St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

Francis's death sets in motion the process of selecting a new Pope through an election known as a conclave. The College of Cardinals - the Church's most senior officials - will be summoned to Rome to take part in the secretive vote.  The Pope appointed cardinals from a broader range of geographic and theological backgrounds than some of his successors, which could make the outcome of the process more difficult to predict than usual.

Francis had endured bouts of ill-health in recent years, and was most recently discharged from Rome's Gemelli Hospital on 23 March after being treated for pneumonia in both lungs. His doctors had advised a period of rest.  However Francis continued to make some public appearances in his final weeks.

During his final public appearance on the balcony of St Peter’s basilica on Easter Sunday, Francis spoke briefly.  His appearance on a key day in the Catholic calendar was celebrated by worshipers.

Tributes have poured in from around the globe. The acting head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of York, described him as a "holy man of God" who was "also very human".  Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni praised the Pope as a "great man" and said she had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, advice and teachings. King Charles III said in a statement that he was "deeply saddened" to hear of the Pope's death and praised his "tireless commitment".

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer shared his condolences "to the whole of the Catholic Church" and called the pontiff a "Pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten".
US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: "Rest in peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!"

The Pope was born  Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where his parents had fled to from their native Italy to escape fascism.

In 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI became the first Pope to retire voluntarily in almost 600 years - and for almost a decade, the Vatican was home to two Popes.
Francis was chosen to succeed him during the conclave that followed Benedict's departure, and became the first non-European Pope since Syrian-born Gregory III, who died in 741.

Before becoming Pope Francis positioned himself as a compromise candidate by appealing to conservatives while attracting the reformers with his liberal stance on social justice.  He supported the rights of refugees and migrants.  

But on many of the Church's teachings, Pope Francis was a traditionalist. He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples but did not favour calling it marriage. This, he said, would be "an attempt to destroy God's plan".  He took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn "from the moment of conception".

*  He was 88. The Vatican announced that the Pope died at 7.35 this morning, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=6.96s)]
*  less than 24 hours after he was last seen in public blessing the Easter crowds. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=12.44s)]
*  The Pope's body is now lying in a chapel in Vatican City. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=18.0s)]
*  His funeral would normally be held four to six days after his death, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=22.2s)]
*  so possibly as soon as this weekend. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=27.12s)]
*  The US President Donald Trump has already said tonight that he will be attending. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Pope Francis was last seen in public just yesterday, appearing on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=35.36s)]
*  to bless thousands of worshippers who had gathered there to see him on Easter Sunday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  He was the leader of more than one billion Catholics and tributes have been paid from all around the world. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=48.84s)]
*  We'll look back at his life and we'll look ahead at the next days and weeks [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  as preparations are made for his funeral and then the election of his successor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=59.36s)]
*  Our first report is from Rupert Wingfield Hayes at the Vatican. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=64.08s)]
*  An Easter Monday in the Vatican that no one could have anticipated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=70.64s)]
*  Pilgrims flocking to the Vatican to be greeted by the news of the death of a Pope. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=74.16s)]
*  Just after 10 had come this shocking announcement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=80.32s)]
*  At 7.35 this morning the Bishop of Rome Francis returned to the house of the Father. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=84.08s)]
*  His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and his church. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=94.64s)]
*  He taught us to live the values of the gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=100.0s)]
*  especially toward the poorest and most marginalized. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=106.08s)]
*  Across Rome the bells of every church began to ring out, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=113.6s)]
*  a solemn salute and a message to the people of Rome that the Pope had died. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  In St Peter's Square the news spread fast bringing shock and sadness. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  I was sort of really really shocked because I was here yesterday at Mass [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=126.96s)]
*  and I saw the Pope and he looked just so fragile you know. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=133.2s)]
*  Also sad considering that he's been a very energetic Pope. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=138.16s)]
*  I have really appreciated the reforms that he has brought into the church, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=142.64s)]
*  his leadership style, the synodal leadership style. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  I think he's been a great Pope. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=151.6s)]
*  It's a great disappointment, a great loss, a man who has innovated the church [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  and a man who has left a great mark and this his absence causes great pain. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  You can see that when we ask people here what Pope Francis meant to them you hear the same words [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  coming up over and over. They speak of his humanity, of his warmth and of his moral leadership. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=171.36s)]
*  Wherever he went around the world he was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=177.52s)]
*  just as he was here in St Peter's Square yesterday in his very last public appearance. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=181.44000000000003s)]
*  On Sunday morning a clearly frail Pope Francis had greeted cheering crowds of Easter worshipers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=188.4s)]
*  from the balcony of St Peter's. In a very thin voice he gave this final Easter greeting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=194.24s)]
*  It has now been confirmed he died after suffering a stroke and heart failure. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=202.08s)]
*  Only weeks before he had been discharged from hospital after suffering double pneumonia. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  It's clear Pope Francis was determined to be in St Peter's Square to celebrate Easter yesterday, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=212.8s)]
*  but as he was driven around in his Pope mobile he looked frail and exhausted. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=218.56s)]
*  Tonight the Pope's official residence was sealed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  Outside thousands gathered to pray for him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=231.36s)]
*  Soon they will be joined by the great and the good from across the world [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=246.0s)]
*  to attend his funeral, including we are told President Donald Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=249.52s)]
*  But for those here there is simply gratitude for the man he was and the job he did [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=254.56s)]
*  in leading their church. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=259.92s)]
*  Rupert Ringfield Hayes, BBC News in Rome. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=262.0s)]
*  Well our religion editor Alim Mubool is at the Vatican and Alim you've been talking to some of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=266.16s)]
*  the people who've gathered there this evening and we've also been learning more details tonight [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=271.6s)]
*  about the Pope's last wishes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=275.12s)]
*  Yes of course thousands of people streamed into St Peter's Square during the day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  They knew of course he was elderly, they knew of course that he had a very complex [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=284.56s)]
*  health picture but the reason a lot of them are feeling so much shock is because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=288.8s)]
*  they saw him just yesterday among them and seemingly getting better. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=293.2s)]
*  Well now we know that he suffered a stroke and a heart attack but a lot of those people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=297.36s)]
*  now feel privileged to have seen him for the final time in a public event like the mass yesterday [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=302.72s)]
*  and feel privileged to be a part of all of this and yes the Pope we now know left [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=308.88s)]
*  final words a final testament to be read out and it was published this evening. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=314.32s)]
*  In it he talks about the way he wanted to be buried very simply with a tombstone that just [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  says his name Francis in a church not St Peter's Basilica behind me but part of his message was [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=325.52s)]
*  also to some of those who've been here and who've been praying for him today and this is how he [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=333.12s)]
*  ended that testament. He said may the Lord grant a fitting reward to all those who've loved me [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=339.28s)]
*  and who continue to pray for me the suffering that has marked the final part of my life [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=345.44s)]
*  I offer to the Lord for peace in the world and for fraternity among peoples and that message at the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=350.4s)]
*  end is very much in keeping with one of the legacies of Pope Francis papacy. Yes he spoke out [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  for the marginalized but he was also vehemently anti-war. I've been taking a look at Pope Francis [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=364.0s)]
*  life and his hugely consequential papacy. His surprise election in 2013 would mark a more [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=370.72s)]
*  radical break with the past than many expected. Jorge Bergoglio did have Italian roots but was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=381.36s)]
*  born in Argentina. While studying for priesthood he worked briefly as a nightclub bouncer. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=389.04s)]
*  As pope he greeted his flock having taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=396.48s)]
*  His style was informal even when conducting ceremonies and his first act as pope was to pay [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  his own hotel bill. In his early gestures like washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=409.76s)]
*  he showed desire for his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=417.52s)]
*  He spoke out for the protection of migrants and refugees laying a wreath on the waters where so [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  many died on their perilous journeys. He linked economic inequality to the environment. In a video [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=429.44s)]
*  launching a papal encyclical he said climate change amounted to rich countries inflicting [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=436.88s)]
*  damage on poor ones. He traveled widely drawing energy from the crowds. In Brazil [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=442.24s)]
*  three million gathered on Copacabana beach. The pope of the holy sea. In 2015 he became the first [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=449.92s)]
*  pope to address the US congress. I am most grateful for invitation. Telling the world's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=457.68s)]
*  richest nation to take care of mother earth. God bless America. He apologized for the scandal [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=464.48s)]
*  of sexual abuse of children by priests. His words here spoken by a translator. God weeps [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  for the sexual abuse of children. On a visit to Ireland the first by a pope in almost 40 years [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=484.24s)]
*  he apologized to victims at almost every event but scandals continued to emerge. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=492.72s)]
*  His papacy marks something of a change of tone on the subject of homosexuality. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Early on remarking who am I to judge when talking about a gay bishop. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  But some progressives argue that in practical terms the Vatican's stance and the church's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=510.72s)]
*  teachings have changed little. Even so conservative Catholics viewed him with suspicion. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  But in some ways he was as traditional as Pope John Paul II whom he made a saint and he had very [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=522.72s)]
*  conservative views on abortion, contraception, surrogacy and gender reassignment. His style of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=529.2s)]
*  papacy though couldn't have been more different to his immediate predecessor Benedict XVI whose [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=536.48s)]
*  funeral he presided over. Through the scores of cardinals from the developing world he appointed [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  he changed the complexion of the church hierarchy consolidating a shift in the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=549.36s)]
*  center of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe where it was in decline [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=554.08s)]
*  toward Latin America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=558.72s)]
*  In recent years Pope Francis was beset by health issues most noticeably affecting his mobility [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=564.4s)]
*  but he found it hard to pare down his busy schedule. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=570.88s)]
*  He was above all a pastoral pope, a man of humility who preferred the fellowship of ordinary [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=579.76s)]
*  believers to the trappings of ecclesiastical status and power. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=585.44s)]
*  Aileen McBall. Throughout the day tributes have been paid from all around the world. King Charles, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=591.28s)]
*  one of the last people to meet the pope during a visit to Rome two weeks ago said his holiness [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=596.88s)]
*  will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the people and the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=602.48s)]
*  unity of the church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=608.16s)]
*  The flag above Buckingham Palace has been lowered to half mast. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=615.4399999999999s)]

*  his humility was a source of inspiration. When he became pope we are all awed by how humble he was [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=736.9599999999999s)]

*  church to select a new leader. The vote which is held in the Sistine Chapel usually takes place [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=875.68s)]

*  where worshippers came to pray for a man who hoped to simplify the philosophy of his church. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=904.48s)]
*  So one of his quotes as I remember was if you want to know how successful your economy is [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=910.16s)]
*  ask an unemployed person. He wanted us to look at things as you were from the outside in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=916.8s)]
*  and not from the inside out and in that sense his desire to uphold and promote the cause of those on [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=923.52s)]
*  the margins was also a critique. The pope's office and apartments have been sealed. The papal [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=932.1600000000001s)]

*  of a pope's death. But Pope Francis was a man with his own ideas. He has elected not to be [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=952.32s)]
*  buried in the Vatican like most of his predecessors but in the Basilica of St Mary Major where he [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=960.0s)]
*  often chose to pray. It is in one of Rome's less glamorous neighborhoods, Esquilino, home to budget [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=964.96s)]
*  hotels and modest B&Bs, close to the main bus and railway stations, the district where many immigrants [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=972.32s)]
*  have put down roots. Unlike the grand and traditional papal funeral afforded to Pope Benedict [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=978.4s)]
*  in 2023, Francis has designed a much humbler service. Rather than the grand three-layered [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=987.28s)]

*  days of official mourning. Almost 80% of the cardinals who will elect Pope Francis's successor [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1002.08s)]

*  the conclave has chosen the new supreme pontiff may well be a surprise. He's not followed the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1022.4000000000001s)]

*  his death. A church less Roman and more Catholic, less focused on Europe and more on its global [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  diverse congregation. We commend to God the soul of our beloved Pope Francis. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1054.88s)]

*  is all over that for the first time. It'll be a conclave of where more than half of the cardinal [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1090.0s)]
*  electors as they're called are non-Europeans but of course his legacy is much more than that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  That's why a lot of the tributes pouring in from every corner of the world are not just from [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7_S4EKKjc&t=1104.24s)]
