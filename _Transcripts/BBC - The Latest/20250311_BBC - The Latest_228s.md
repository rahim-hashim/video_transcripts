Video Description: A Kurdish-led militia alliance which controls north-eastern Syria has signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state, the country's presidency said.
 
The agreement, which includes an end of hostilities, says the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will hand over control of the region's border posts, airport, and vital oil and gas fields.
 
It also recognises the Kurdish minority as "an integral part of the Syrian state" and guarantees "the rights of all Syrians to representation and participation in the political process".

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs)
*  Let's move on to Syria now. The UN says entire families were killed in Syria's coastal region [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=0.0s)]
*  during clashes between the new authorities and members of the Alawite community, which [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=5.68s)]
*  is mostly loyal to the former President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=9.64s)]
*  The UN Human Rights Office says it's so far documented the killing of over 100 civilians, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=12.88s)]
*  mostly in summary executions, and it expects that final figure to be much higher. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  We have been speaking to a spokesperson who told us the killings appeared to have been [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=22.36s)]
*  War monitors are putting the number of dead just under 1100. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=27.12s)]
*  On Monday as well, another development to bring you is that the new government reached [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  a deal with Kurdish forces to integrate them into the country's institutions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=34.2s)]
*  The Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharah and the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazum [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=38.8s)]
*  Rabdi, said the deal would establish a ceasefire across Syria and integrate all institutions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=43.32s)]
*  in the northeast into the Syrian state. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=49.08s)]
*  So let's speak to our correspondent in Damascus, Lina Sinjab, who joins us from there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Firstly, Lina, I've been speaking to the UN about the investigation they've done. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  They're confirming 100 people have been killed, Alawites in sectarian killings, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  but acknowledge that that figure is going to be much higher. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=68.36s)]
*  What are the latest eyewitness testimonies that you've heard from that part of Syria? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=71.88s)]
*  Well, so far, the situation has calmed down according to eyewitnesses in various parts of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=76.36s)]
*  the coastal cities. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=83.96s)]
*  And the Ministry of Defense itself announced that they've stopped the operation where there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=85.88s)]
*  were clashes between remnants of the Assad regime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=91.64s)]
*  I've just been talking to one resident who fled his home in Banias, and he said that, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=94.28s)]
*  you know, security enforcement, you know, there are checkpoints around. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=99.0s)]
*  There's checkpoints around to protect people from any. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=107.16s)]
*  And, you know, so there are also, you know, efforts by the investigative committee to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=114.36s)]
*  investigate, investigate what's happening and the killing that happened that happened over [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=121.32s)]
*  the past three days. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  This is by order of the interim president, Ahmad Al-Shara. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=127.16s)]
*  And, you know, there is a lot of work happening on the ground. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=130.52s)]
*  Also, not only to arrest those who've been involved in the killing, but even they're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  targeting people who are sending hate messages or inciting sectarianism online. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=139.4s)]
*  So really, the government has taken by surprise by members of its own forces conducting these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  kinds of crimes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=154.52s)]
*  And they are trying to work on this topic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=155.88s)]
*  And Lina, in terms of this deal that has now been agreed with the SDF, how much does that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=160.44s)]
*  help bring security to the country? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=165.56s)]
*  Well, this is a very important breakthrough deal that happened, you know, yesterday. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=169.64s)]
*  The situation with the Kurdish Democratic was really sending a lot of concern for, you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=176.12s)]
*  know, the country and the interim president have been calling to join forces. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=183.08s)]
*  And that's what happened yesterday and happened at the time where really everyone in the country [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  was really concerned about the safety, the unity of the country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  And at the time where some voices were calling for international protection, the coastal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=198.52s)]
*  side. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=204.68s)]
*  So this step and this announcement and coming out from here, from Damascus, that there will be one [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=205.0s)]
*  army, one group together protecting the rights of the Kurds also is a breakthrough. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=209.8s)]
*  Remember that the Kurds never enjoyed any equal rights during the time of Assad. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  So that's really an achievement. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=221.24s)]
*  Lina, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  Lina Sinjad there in Damascus. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqxi0gN9EHs&t=226.36s)]
