Video Description: US President Donald Trump can keep collecting import taxes for now, an appeals court has said, a day after a trade ruling found the bulk of his global tariffs to be illegal.
A federal appeals court granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which ruled that Trump had overstepped his power by imposingÂ the duties.
Wednesday's judgement from the US Court of International Trade drew the ire of Trump officials, who called it an example of judicial overreach.
Small businesses and a group of states had challenged the measures, which are at the heart of Trump's agenda and have shaken up the world economic order.

# US appeals court reinstates Trump tariff plans | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA)
*  After less than a 24-hour pause, the Trump administration's sweeping tariff plan is back on, at least for now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. Court of Appeals is temporarily halting a U.S. trade court's decision on Wednesday evening [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=7.0s)]
*  that would have blocked most of Mr. Trump's tariffs as the administration appeals against it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, the Court of International Trade found that Mr. Trump overstepped his authority [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=18.0s)]
*  when in April he used an emergency law to impose tariffs on nearly every country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=23.0s)]
*  Today, the White House sharply criticized the trade court, calling its ruling a judicial overreach. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=29.0s)]
*  The Trump administration says that it's preparing to appeal the ruling all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=35.0s)]
*  Here's our North America editor, Sarah Smith. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=40.0s)]
*  The opening bell marked a small celebration for U.S. stock markets this morning, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=45.0s)]
*  with prices rising on the news that Donald Trump's trade tariffs may be illegal and might have to be struck down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=49.0s)]
*  The markets hate the idea of a global trade war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=56.0s)]
*  My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=59.0s)]
*  The president has delighted in imposing trade tariffs on almost every country in the world, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=63.0s)]
*  claiming that he could use extraordinary emergency powers to do this without passing legislation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=68.0s)]
*  because, he said, America was facing a national economic crisis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=73.0s)]
*  They're ripping us off and they understood it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=77.0s)]
*  But a court has ruled he does not have the authority to do this on his own, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=79.0s)]
*  prompting outrage from the White House. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=83.0s)]
*  The courts should have no role here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=85.0s)]
*  There is a troubling and dangerous trend of unelected judges inserting themselves into the presidential decision-making process. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=87.0s)]
*  America cannot function if President Trump, or any other president for that matter, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=93.0s)]
*  has their sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations railroaded by activist judges. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=98.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has raised tariffs on some countries sky high and then promptly dropped them again, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=103.0s)]
*  leading some people to say he chickens out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=109.0s)]
*  President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the taco trade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=112.0s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out on your tariff threats, and that's why markets are higher this week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=115.0s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=120.0s)]
*  I kick out? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=121.0s)]
*  Chicken out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=122.0s)]
*  Oh, and then I chicken out. I've never heard that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=123.0s)]
*  You mean because I reduced China from 145 percent that I set down to 100 and then down to another number? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=126.0s)]
*  Those numbers, the tariff rates charged on goods imported into America, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=134.0s)]
*  keep going up and down, according it seems to Donald Trump's moods. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=138.0s)]
*  If he doesn't have the authority to impose high import taxes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=143.0s)]
*  will that stop other countries from negotiating new trade deals? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=147.0s)]
*  The court cases were brought by 12 U.S. states and five businesses that argued the Trump tariffs were hurting American companies and consumers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=151.0s)]
*  Tariffs are something that are not just out there in the ether, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=159.0s)]
*  They are something that we all pay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=163.0s)]
*  They get passed down to us as consumers. They get passed down to small businesses, which impact us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=166.0s)]
*  Twenty-five percent import taxes that America has imposed on cars, steel and aluminium can remain unaffected by the court ruling. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=171.0s)]
*  Cars made in Britain, though, will only be charged 10 percent because the UK is the first and only country so far to have signed a new trade deal with America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=179.0s)]
*  A deal that looks less favourable if Donald Trump never had the authority to threaten higher tariff rates or force a trade negotiation in the first place. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=188.0s)]
*  News that an appeals court has reinstated the president's tariff plan for now is being treated as a victory by the administration. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=197.0s)]
*  President Trump's case is ironclad and the appeals court took almost no time at all. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=204.0s)]
*  In fact, we're surprised it took till the end of the day for them to overturn this previous ruling. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=209.0s)]
*  The closing bell on Wall Street saw a market extremely uncertain about what will happen next with the Trump tariffs, who will ultimately win in court. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=214.0s)]
*  And uncertainty is never good for business. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=221.0s)]
*  Well, Ambassador Michael Froman is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and previously served in President Obama's administration as the US trade representative. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=225.0s)]
*  And he gave us his take on the past 24 hours. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=235.0s)]
*  Well, for right now, tariffs will continue to be paid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=239.0s)]
*  And by the way, the court ruling was about the tariffs that the president announced using the emergency powers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=242.0s)]
*  There are other tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and autos that the court did not touch. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=250.0s)]
*  So those are certainly in place, regardless of the appeal. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=256.0s)]
*  And the others are in place pending the appeal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=259.0s)]
*  You know, the under the Constitution, the US Constitution, the Congress has the right to set tariff rates. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=262.0s)]
*  And then over the years has delegated that authority to the president and to the executive under certain conditions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=268.0s)]
*  If there's been unfair trade practices, if there's a national security issue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=275.0s)]
*  And in this case, the president used a different kind of authority, an emergency economic authority, which allows him to shortcut some of the procedures of those other delegations. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=279.0s)]
*  So he can still impose tariffs going forward using other authorities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=289.0s)]
*  It just would take him more time and more process to do so. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYT7Du_REA&t=294.0s)]
