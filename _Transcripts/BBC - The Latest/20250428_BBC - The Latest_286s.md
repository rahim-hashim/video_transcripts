Video Description: At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel has said.

Al Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. 

It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.

There was no immediate comment from the US military.

But it came hours after US Central Command announced that its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.

# Dozens of African migrants killed in US strike on Yemen, Houthis say | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8)
*  The Houthis in Yemen say a US airstrike in Sada in the north of the country has killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=0.0s)]
*  at least 68 people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Houthi-controlled television said a detention centre housing African migrants was hit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=8.88s)]
*  Earlier, the Houthis said US strikes on the capital Sana'a killed at least eight people, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=13.84s)]
*  including women and children. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=18.56s)]
*  The United States military says it has hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since the middle [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=20.44s)]
*  of last month, killing hundreds of Houthi fighters and many of the group's leaders. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=25.1s)]
*  Let's speak now to Wolf Christian Pesce, who's with the International Institute of Strategic [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=30.14s)]
*  Studies and formerly sat on the UN Security Council's panel of experts on Yemen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=35.08s)]
*  Wolf Christian, thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=40.94s)]
*  Just give us a sense of US reaction to this particular strike, the outcome of this particular [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  strike and whether they feel any sense of concern about reputational damage to the US [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=50.98s)]
*  given that it's being reported women and children have been killed in this strike. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=59.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, the target appears to have been a compound that also houses a detention centre [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=65.06s)]
*  where migrants, illegal migrants are being detained, mostly people from Africa trying [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=70.98s)]
*  to cross to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=76.42s)]
*  What's really interesting about the strike is this is the second time this facility was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=78.5s)]
*  hit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=82.41999999999999s)]
*  So we had a similar attack in January 2020, 2022 by the Saudi led military coalition. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=83.41999999999999s)]
*  And at that time, the Saudi forces claimed that the facility also included a drone factory, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  basically a place where suicide drones were being manufactured. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  I myself received some intelligence information at that time together with my colleagues and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=103.06s)]
*  it seems a credible claim. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=108.3s)]
*  So what probably happened is that this production has resumed, even though we don't really know [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=109.86s)]
*  based on what intelligence the US has been acting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=116.62s)]
*  And what also probably happened is that civilians in fairly large numbers got hurt as part of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  the attack. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=126.42s)]
*  And is it a houthi tactic to actually have these weapons production facilities situated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=127.62s)]
*  close to where civilians are living or being held in this case? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=133.02s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=138.1s)]
*  And I mean, this also constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=139.1s)]
*  So I mean, as you know, all conflict parties have to take all possible steps to make sure [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=143.42s)]
*  that civilians are not being hurt. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=150.22s)]
*  And the Houthis have been hiding weapon manufacturing sites close to civilian infrastructure in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=152.9s)]
*  the past, much the same as other sort of members of the Axis of Resistance have done elsewhere. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=158.98s)]
*  What sort of impact will this latest strike have on the Houthis capabilities? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=166.26s)]
*  Well, it's hard to tell because we don't really know what the production numbers are. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=171.34s)]
*  In fact, we don't really know what evidence the US government had that production has [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=176.06s)]
*  resumed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  But I mean, this seems to be the most likely theory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  The Houthis certainly have more than one manufacturing site. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=185.54s)]
*  They've been launching hundreds and hundreds of drones over the last 18 months or so. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  One side less is not going to have an outsized impact on their attack capabilities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=194.94s)]
*  And you mentioned that previous attack led by the Saudis who eventually pulled back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=202.82s)]
*  Do you think the US will persist with its operations in this area? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=208.98s)]
*  Well, the question really is, what is the end game here? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  So I mean, the US has stated that the goal of these attacks is to make the Houthis stop [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=217.62s)]
*  their attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and their attacks on Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=224.22000000000003s)]
*  Now, there haven't been any attacks on ships by the while, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  I think the last one was in December last year, whereas the attacks on Israel certainly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  continue. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=236.58s)]
*  In fact, just a couple of hours ago, a ballistic missile was launched on Israel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=237.58s)]
*  So I think what the attacks can do, the US attacks, is they can diminish the capability [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=242.62s)]
*  of the Houthis to strike, but not to eliminate it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=247.42s)]
*  So the question is basically, it's a game of chicken. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=250.14s)]
*  I mean, who changes course first? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=255.1s)]
*  I don't know how long the US is planning to maintain the current pace of attacks. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=259.78s)]
*  800 attacks is a fairly high number in a relatively short period of time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=264.7s)]
*  One would assume that eventually, they expect results, and it's too early to say when that might be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=270.22s)]
*  OK, well, Christian Pace from the International Institute of Strategic Studies, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  thank you very much for your time today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuzjvR_0Q8&t=284.1s)]
