Video Description: South African Charl Kleinhaus had defended his new US refugee status in a BBC interview, saying he fled his Mpumalanga farm after death threats.
 
He is one of 59 Afrikaners who are being resettled in the US under a controversial Trump administration policy. President Donald Trump said the Afrikaners were victims of "racial discrimination". 
 
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has called them "cowards" who do not merit refugee status. 
 
Kleinhaus has also come under scrutiny over antisemitic comments on social media that have since been deleted. He spoke to the BBC's Nomia Iqbal.

# South African refugee says 'I didn't come to US for fun' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s)
*  Now this week a group of 59 white South Africans arrived in the US where they've been granted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=0.0s)]
*  refugee status. President Donald Trump says the refugee applications were expedited because [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=5.12s)]
*  they're victims of racial discrimination. The South African government denies this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=10.28s)]
*  Afrikaners settled in South Africa nearly four centuries ago and led the apartheid movement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  there. Usually it takes years for the government to process refugees. This group waited just [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=20.04s)]
*  three months. Let's go to our North America correspondent, Namia Iqbal now, who has been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=25.56s)]
*  speaking exclusively to one of these men who is resettling in Buffalo, New York. Namia, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  what did he have to say? This is the first time we've heard from one of those Afrikaners [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=36.4s)]
*  that is now seen as a refugee here in America. Charles Kleinhouse is 46 years of age. He [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=43.64s)]
*  comes from a beautiful province in South Africa, a lovely farmland. Now he lives in a budget [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=49.96s)]
*  hotel near a highway with his two children and very young grandson. So the change in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  life could not be starker. But he said to me that he had to do it for safety reasons. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=62.56s)]
*  Mr Kleinhouse has also come under particular scrutiny given that old posts of his, which [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  are anti-Jewish, have been found. It has led to all these questions about were these people [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=73.0s)]
*  properly vetted as refugees often are. The Department of Homeland Security said to us [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=78.6s)]
*  today they were vetted. Nonetheless, it has raised these questions and Mr Kleinhouse [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  defended those posts to me, but he also defended his right, as he sees it, to be here in America [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=89.52s)]
*  as a refugee. If you're white, you're wrong in South Africa. You are a land thief, you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=96.84s)]
*  are a racist. The whole time it's been told, and there is racist white people, plenty of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=103.84s)]
*  them. You say you're not a racist white person. No, not at all. I've got many black friends. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I think I've got more African black men as white friends. I'm tired of being told, just [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=114.04s)]
*  because I'm white, I'm a thief, just because I'm white, I'm wrong in this. I had nothing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=120.84s)]
*  to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Is there anything specific that's happened, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=126.0s)]
*  that made you think, I've got to get out of here? I've got to leave. After the death threats [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=130.88s)]
*  and stuff and my machinery being cut up and I'm still, after reporting everything to the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=134.72s)]
*  police, not getting any protection or anything like that, the only thing that's left on my [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=138.92s)]
*  farm is a sign that says mining area. All the fences has been taken off, boom gates has [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  been broken off. There are voices out there, including the South African president who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=150.64s)]
*  has called you cowards. You've got other Afrikaners who are saying that you're not refugees, you're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  opportunists, that you've abandoned the country. What would you say to those people? I had [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=163.28s)]
*  to leave a five bedroom house, which I will lose now because I'm not going to pay for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  it, behind my car, behind my dogs, behind my mother, behind... I didn't come here for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  fun, but my children are safe. What was it like when you got off the shuttle bus and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=180.96s)]
*  came into that hangar and were greeted by the Trump administration? It was overwhelming. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=189.52s)]
*  I didn't expect that because I thought we were going to be on a shuttle bus, taken somewhere [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  and we will start working. All of us that is there, we know we're going to start here [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=201.32s)]
*  from the bottom because we are the new people here. We're going to start from the bottom, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=207.12s)]
*  bottom, bottom, bottom. Do you ever worry that you might be caught up in some big political [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=210.6s)]
*  game here? That you're a pawn somehow? It's a scary, scary thing, but people mustn't think [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=216.6s)]
*  we're just taking advantage of this. We're coming here to make a contribution to the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=221.56s)]
*  country. Old tweets of yours have been dug up in which you appear to have made anti-Semitic [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=226.48s)]
*  comments and so people are questioning, should you be here? What would you say to that? I [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  would like them... What was that? I've deleted a comment, but I was actually thinking I should [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=236.4s)]
*  have not deleted it. If you go look where I commented on, it was passed over to Orthodox [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Jews and I'm Christian. We're spitting and screaming and bumping Christians walking with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=248.08s)]
*  the cross. For me as a Christian that is not acceptable. In Israel, and I went and I said [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  something on Twitter which I copy and pasted from somebody else's page because if you go [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=260.72s)]
*  read my post you'll see it's not the way I write. So you had quoted someone else? I copied [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=265.4s)]
*  and pasted it. The quotes were anti-Semitic. They said Jews are dangerous people, they're [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  untrustworthy, they're not God's chosen people. I was super angry. So you did it out of anger? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=277.8s)]
*  And I was in hospital at that point of time. I was on morphine, but that's not an excuse. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=282.8s)]
*  Drugs don't make you an anti-Semite though, do they? Even now, if I would see any person [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=288.44s)]
*  going against my religion I would speak up against it. You have high hopes being here [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=295.32s)]
*  in America. Is there a part of you that is anxious that it might not work out? No, to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=299.96s)]
*  be honest with you because of my belief, I believe this is God's plan for me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzvTfusnt6s&t=307.79999999999995s)]
