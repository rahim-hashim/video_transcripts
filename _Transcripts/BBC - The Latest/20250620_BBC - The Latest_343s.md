Video Description: Iran’s foreign minister has warned that Israel’s attack on his country is a "historic moment for human civilisation" in which countries must stand up for international law.
 
Speaking to the UN Human Rights Council, Abbas Araghchi said Israel attacked his country in the "midst of an ongoing diplomatic process" with the US about Iran’s nuclear capability - a process he said has been "promising".
 
He described Israel’s surprise attack as "an outrageous act of aggression", a "stark violation of the UN charter," which defied ‘the standards this council stands for.’
 
Israel has been hit by a new round of Iranian strikes this afternoon. It said its military had attacked dozens of targets, including what it called missile manufacturing sites in Tehran.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM)
*  Thank you back to Geneva, to the UN's Human Rights Council, a human rights council where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=0.0s)]
*  the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aradji is speaking. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=4.46s)]
*  This is an unjust war imposed on my people since early hours of Friday the 13th of June [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=8.94s)]
*  when Israel perpetrated a mix of unlawful and criminal operations against off-duty military [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=14.96s)]
*  personnel, university professors and ordinary people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of my fellow Iranians have been killed and injured following Israel's surprise armed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=27.14s)]
*  attacks and terrorist operations on residential areas, public infrastructures, hospitals, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  health centres and of course the foreign ministry. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=41.58s)]
*  Our peaceful nuclear facilities have also been targeted despite their being under full [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=46.92s)]
*  monitoring of IAEA and despite the fact that attacking such facilities are absolutely banned [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=51.94s)]
*  under international law. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=59.64s)]
*  Israel attacks on nuclear facilities are grave war crimes given also the danger of environmental [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=62.66s)]
*  and health catastrophe as a result of radiological leakage. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=69.12s)]
*  Mr. President, Iran, a founding member of the United Nations system, rightfully expects [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=76.14s)]
*  each and every one of you to stand for justice, rule of law and basic tenets of humanity and ethics. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  Iran is under a merciless act of aggression. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=90.78s)]
*  This is crystal clear fact, must not be allowed to be twisted upside down by Israel and its backers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Israel aggression on Iran cannot and must not be justified by any legal or moral standards. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=103.86s)]
*  Any justification for this unjust and criminal war would be tantamount to complicity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=109.94s)]
*  Iran is defending itself against barbaric aggression. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=117.78s)]
*  We are entitled, tasked and determined to defend our territorial integrity, national [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  sovereignty and security with all force. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=128.1s)]
*  This is our inherent right as also clearly recognized under Article 51 of Charter. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=132.5s)]
*  Dear colleagues, the peace and rule of law are at serious stake as a result of Israel's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=140.1s)]
*  unlawful invasion of Iran. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=146.62s)]
*  Israel is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=149.3s)]
*  International humanitarian law are already badly undermined as a consequence of Israel's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=153.78s)]
*  relentless atrocities in occupied Palestine and elsewhere is now under another extremely [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=159.46s)]
*  serious danger as Israel is committing grave violations of 1949 Geneva Conventions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=164.94s)]
*  Mr. President, Switzerland is the custodian of Geneva Conventions and protocols on IHL [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=171.86s)]
*  and has an important responsibility in this regard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  Indeed, every state party to 1949 convention shall shoulder their responsibility under [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=183.94s)]
*  these conventions, in particular, Common Articles 1 and 3 of these conventions. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=190.18s)]
*  Dear colleagues, we were attacked in the midst of an ongoing diplomatic process. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=196.34s)]
*  We were supposed to meet with Americans on 15 June to craft a very promising agreement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=200.86s)]
*  for peaceful resolution of the issues fabricated over our peaceful nuclear program. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=207.9s)]
*  It was a betrayal of diplomacy and unprecedented blow to the foundation of international law [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=214.94s)]
*  and UN system. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=223.18s)]
*  Let me be clear, if there is any use of costly systems and mechanisms we have created for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=225.38s)]
*  the past 80 decades to preserve human rights and dignity, now is the time to do it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=230.98s)]
*  We need action now, otherwise the whole UN-based international law system would corrode badly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  This is a historic moment for human civilization when a civilized nation has come under an [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=244.94s)]
*  unjust war of aggression. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=250.22s)]
*  The world, every state, every UN mechanism and body has to be alarmed and has to act [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  now to stop the aggressor, to end impunity and to hold the criminals accountable for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=259.14s)]
*  their unending atrocities and crimes in our region. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=265.54s)]
*  This is a call from someone who has allocated his whole life to dialogue and diplomacy, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=272.38s)]
*  but who also is a veteran of an imposed war by Saddam regime and knows how to defend his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=279.38s)]
*  beloved motherland. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=289.38s)]
*  Thank you, Excellency. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  And that was the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aradji addressing the Human Rights Council [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=297.14s)]
*  in Geneva. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=303.94s)]
*  He said that Iran had been attacked in the middle of an ongoing diplomatic process and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=306.78s)]
*  called it an unjust war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=311.94s)]
*  We heard from the Ambassador for the Permanent Mission of Israel to the UN Office in Geneva [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=315.66s)]
*  saying that Iran was destabilizing the world and was an imminent and existential threat [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=322.66s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=327.98s)]
*  So those comments ahead of the talks involving the foreign ministers of the UK, Germany, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=329.02s)]
*  France and the Iranian Foreign Minister who you saw there taking place in Geneva shortly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfPqIvEoPM&t=336.02s)]
