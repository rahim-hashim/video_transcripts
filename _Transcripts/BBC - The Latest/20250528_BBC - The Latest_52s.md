**BBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI)
*  I went to sit down and I overheard a passenger come up to the flight attendant who was standing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=0.0s)]
*  right by where I was and she said, I think there's a pigeon on this plane. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=10.38s)]
*  You ready for this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=14.88s)]
*  There's a pigeon on the airplane. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=15.88s)]
*  There's a pigeon on the airplane and it won't go away. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=16.88s)]
*  We open the door. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=21.88s)]

*  Wow. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=25.88s)]
*  The pilot got on and said, uh, attention ladies and gentlemen, we have a wildlife situation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=26.88s)]
*  on the plane and this is not something I'm prepared to deal with. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=32.0s)]
*  So we are summoning folks to come, some crew to come on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=35.64s)]
*  And at that point I pulled my phone out because I think, okay, if it's coming back, I have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=38.92s)]
*  to try to get some footage of this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=42.68s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=44.72s)]
*  The woman next to me obviously was quite panicky about it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=46.0s)]
*  She said to me, she said, oh, I'm going to need to free wine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfnkOZiIEiI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
