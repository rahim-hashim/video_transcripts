# Trump praises tariffs in Cabinet meeting as US economy shrinks for first time since 2022 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg)
*  In a blow to President Trump, the US economy shrank in his first three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=0.0s)]
*  months in office. American gross domestic product, a measure of all [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=4.68s)]
*  the goods and services in the economy, dropped by 0.3% from January [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=8.4s)]
*  to March, a sharp fall after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, President Trump has blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, and said [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=18.68s)]
*  the downturn was nothing to do with his controversial policy on tariffs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=22.28s)]
*  Let's go live to our North America editor, Sarah Smith, at the White [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=26.72s)]
*  House. Sarah, how damaging do you think these figures are for the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=29.52s)]
*  Trump administration? Well, it goes right to the core of the biggest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=32.68s)]
*  reason why Donald Trump was elected when he promised to fix the economy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=38.12s)]
*  and reduce inflation. Since then, the cost of living hasn't really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=42.56s)]
*  fallen significantly and now we see these numbers saying that the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=46.6s)]
*  economy is in fact contracting. So it goes against what he promised to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=49.84s)]
*  do. Donald Trump did return to the US on the 20th of January, these [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=54.32s)]
*  figures covered January, February, March, but he says they're not his [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=58.96s)]
*  fault at all, since he's trying to blame it all on his predecessor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  You probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start off by saying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=64.84s)]
*  that's Biden, that's not Trump, because we came in on January, these [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=69.12s)]
*  are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=73.12s)]
*  that Biden was doing in terms of the economy destroying our country in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=81.28s)]
*  so many ways. Of course, the biggest move on the economy that Donald [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=85.16s)]
*  Trump has made is introducing those very high trade tariffs, which he [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=89.08s)]
*  did at the start of April, but they have affected these numbers because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=92.32s)]
*  there was a huge surge of imports into America from families and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  businesses that were trying to import foreign-made goods before the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=100.12s)]
*  tariff regime kicked in. So that has affected the figures somewhat, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=103.56s)]
*  we will need to wait until the next quarter to see exactly what impact [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=107.88s)]
*  the United States and Ukraine have on the economy, having imposed those [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=112.12s)]
*  high import taxes is going to have on the American economy. OK, Sarah, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=116.0s)]
*  thank you. Meanwhile, the United States and Ukraine are close to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=120.12s)]
*  finally signing a deal on mineral resources, possibly within the next 24 [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=124.16s)]
*  hours. It would see the two countries jointly develop Ukraine's mineral [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=128.24s)]
*  wealth. President Trump says it will be money back for all the aid that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=132.64s)]
*  America has given Ukraine in its war with Russia. An earlier version of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=136.6s)]
*  the deal is expected to be signed between Mr Trump and Ukraine's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=141.84s)]
*  President Zelensky. Live now to John Donison, our correspondent in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=146.28s)]
*  Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. John, after a lot of false starts, it does look [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=150.12s)]
*  like this is going to be signed at last. Certainly that is what the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=153.92s)]
*  Ukrainians are saying. The country's economy minister is currently en [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=158.68s)]
*  route to Washington, DC to meet with US officials. As you say, they are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=163.04s)]
*  waiting for the deal to be signed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=168.36s)]
*  The deal is signed within 24 hours. There are reported to be some last [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=171.56s)]
*  minute disagreements. Let's wait and see. What this deal does is it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=175.56s)]
*  basically gives America access to Ukraine's oil, gas, energy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=179.56s)]
*  infrastructure, mineral wealth. Money from those industries would go [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=184.56s)]
*  into a joint US-Ukrainian investment fund and then some of that money [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=189.56s)]
*  would go into the US-Ukrainian investment fund and also towards [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=194.76s)]
*  paying for American continued military and humanitarian assistance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=197.76s)]
*  There are some who say, critics of the deal, who say it amounts to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=202.76s)]
*  the US extorting Ukraine. But I think the Ukrainian government has [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=206.76s)]
*  made the calculation that if America has a bigger stake in the country, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=210.76s)]
*  it could improve relations and push America to get a better deal in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=215.76s)]
*  Ukraine, which is of course ending the war with Russia. And those [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  peace talks are ongoing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=225.95999999999998s)]
