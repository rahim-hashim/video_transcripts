Video Description: Children should completely avoid "slushy" ice drinks containing glycerol, which can make them very ill, until they are at least eight years old, according to a new study. 

The researchers studied the cases of 21 two-to-seven-year-olds in the UK and Ireland who needed emergency treatment soon after drinking a slushy product.

The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.

If a young child drinks a slushy too quickly, glycerol intoxication could cause shock, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) and loss of consciousness.

# Children under eight should avoid drinking slushies, doctors warn | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo)
*  that children under eight years of age should avoid slush ice drinks containing the sweetener [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=0.0s)]
*  Glycerol. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at the cases of more [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=5.24s)]
*  than 20 children who needed emergency treatments after having the drinks. Our correspondent [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=9.76s)]
*  Simon Jones reports. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=14.34s)]
*  They're brightly coloured, designed to appeal to children. Slushes increasingly contain [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=17.76s)]
*  Glycerol, a naturally occurring sweetener, instead of sugar. But there's concern about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=22.98s)]
*  the effects on the young. Four-year-old Albie almost died, according to his mum, after having [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=28.56s)]
*  a slushie at a bowling alley. He collapsed and spent three days in hospital. Medics said [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=33.96s)]
*  he'd suffered an intolerance to Glycerol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=39.08s)]
*  Researchers looked at the cases of 21 children in the UK and Ireland, aged between two and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=42.26s)]
*  seven, who became acutely ill after drinking slushes. They suffered reduced consciousness, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=47.06s)]
*  a sudden sharp drop in blood sugar and a build-up of acid in the blood. All recovered and were [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  told to avoid the drinks in future. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=58.2s)]
*  Current voluntary guidance from the Food Standards Agency advises that slushes containing Glycerol [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=60.96s)]
*  shouldn't be sold to children aged four years or under. The Glycerol is put in the drinks [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=67.16s)]
*  to stop the ice from fully freezing, maintaining that slushie effect. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=72.36s)]
*  Researchers say Glycerol can have a different effect depending on someone's weight, how [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  quickly it's drunk and whether it's consumed with a meal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=81.76s)]
*  The guidance that currently exists for children under four not to be given slushies should [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=85.24s)]
*  possibly be extended up to eight or further to err on the side of caution because at this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=90.44s)]
*  point in time we don't have any transparency about how much Glycerol is in some of these [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=99.64s)]
*  drinks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=103.96s)]
*  Some parents are already wary. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=105.36s)]
*  Would you be happy giving your child a slushie? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=107.64s)]
*  I'm very reluctant to. My daughter's probably only had one or two in her lifetime at a circus [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=109.84s)]
*  visit and she doesn't actually like them anyway so it's a bit of a blessing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=115.08s)]
*  I suppose if they're not having them I'd like anything in moderations, okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=118.88s)]
*  In a statement the Food Standards Agency said, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=124.52s)]
*  We are considering the findings of this review carefully. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=126.92s)]
*  While the symptoms of Glycerol intoxication are usually mild, it is important that parents [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=130.12s)]
*  are aware of the risks, particularly at high levels of consumption. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=135.2s)]
*  Makers of some of the most popular slushies told us consumer safety is of paramount importance [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  and they take the situation with Glycerol extremely seriously. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvo-KAYHgo&t=146.28s)]
