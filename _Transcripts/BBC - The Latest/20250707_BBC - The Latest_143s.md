**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE)
*  A British teenager who was jailed in Dubai for having sex with a 17-year-old girl has been released and is back in the UK. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=0.0s)]
*  Marcus Fakana, who is now 19, was jailed for a year after a consensual relationship while on holiday with a British national. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=7.0s)]
*  The age of consent in the United Arab Emirates is 18. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=15.0s)]
*  He received a royal pardon after spending seven months behind bars. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=18.0s)]
*  Our reporter, Mairead Smith, has the latest. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=22.0s)]
*  Marcus Fakana was jailed when he was 18 years old. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=25.0s)]
*  He had sex with a 17-year-old who was on holiday, also from the UK. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=29.0s)]
*  Now, he had been in Dubai since the end of August with his parents. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=34.0s)]
*  This happened in December. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=38.0s)]
*  And he was jailed because the age of consent in the UAE is 18. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=40.0s)]
*  It actually happened that the girl's mother had got in touch with the authorities when they had returned to the UK. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=45.0s)]
*  She had discovered messages between Marcus Fakana and her daughter, and that's when she reported him to the authorities. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=52.0s)]
*  So he was jailed for a year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=59.0s)]
*  But he was released on an Eid pardon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=61.0s)]
*  So a Foreign and Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said that that Eid pardon was granted last week. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=64.0s)]
*  They say that we understand he wanted to get back to the UK without media attention and to see his family. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=71.0s)]
*  The FCDO supported him and were in contact with them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=77.0s)]
*  Now, Detained in Dubai is a campaign group. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=82.0s)]
*  They have been advocating for Marcus Fakana, and they've said that he is currently recovering. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=85.0s)]
*  They've said that his case has attracted significant public attention because of concerns about the criminalisation of tourists and disproportionate sentencing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=91.0s)]
*  Now, it's being reported that Marcus Fakana recently wrote to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=100.0s)]
*  that's the ruler of Dubai, from Al-Iwiyah prison asking to be released. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=107.0s)]
*  And that pardon was granted, and he has returned home. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=112.0s)]
*  And how unusual is it to get a pardon in these circumstances? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=116.0s)]
*  Well, this sort of a pardon can happen at times of religious exceptions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=119.0s)]
*  This is what's termed as a gesture of compassion and a way to offer individuals a second chance during religious holidays. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=124.0s)]
*  So it's not known if maybe Marcus Fakana was well aware that this might have been an opportunity for him to ask to be pardoned. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=132.0s)]
*  But we do know that he is now back home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92zCQHwnALE&t=140.0s)]
