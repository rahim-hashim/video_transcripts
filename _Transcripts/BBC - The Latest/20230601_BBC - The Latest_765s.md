Video Description: Atrocities from war are being documented on social media.

This material can be used as evidence to help prosecute war crimes. But the BBC has spoken to people affected by violent conflict who have seen the major social media companies take down this content.

The increasing use of AI means the companies own policies of allowing graphic content to stay on their platforms if it shows human rights abuses, are being undermined, leading to vital evidence being lost for good.

# Are social media companies removing war crimes evidence? - BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI)
*  This is the aftermath of a bombing on a busy food market in Syria. More than 30 people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=0.0s)]
*  killed. Here are bodies of Ukrainian civilians shot and burned by Russian soldiers. These [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=14.18s)]
*  videos that were posted online show evidence of potential war crimes. But look on the big [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  social media platforms and you won't find them anymore. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=29.92s)]
*  Violent images are being removed for breaking rules on graphic content. But that means evidence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  needed to prosecute war criminals can be lost for good. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=52.5s)]
*  Whether or not the social media companies publish it or take it down, you can't afford [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=56.52s)]
*  to lose this material. These videos and these images are very graphic, but it's important [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=60.36s)]
*  because the world needs to know what's happening. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=66.2s)]
*  Ten years ago, Imad owned a pharmacy near the local market in his hometown Aleppo in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=86.52s)]
*  Syria. He was at work when a barrel bomb hit the area. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=109.76s)]
*  It was an attack by the Syrian government. Imad's friends and customers among the dead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=138.04s)]
*  He now lives in France. We've hidden his identity to protect his family back home. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=144.5s)]
*  He remembers a local TV company filming the attack and had seen the footage online. Years [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=152.22s)]
*  later when applying for asylum in the EU, he looked for it again. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Removed by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for breaking rules on graphic content. In the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=168.04s)]
*  chaos of a country at war, the original footage was also lost. It appeared the images showing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=181.2s)]
*  evidence of potential war crimes were missing for good. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=186.76s)]
*  And here lies the problem. Social media companies have long been criticised for allowing easy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=193.34s)]
*  access to distressing content. Now they are increasingly cracking down swiftly to delete [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=198.94s)]
*  it. But by deleting it, evidence of crime and abuse can be lost forever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=204.46s)]
*  The social media companies are being over cautious. So they've copped a lot of criticism [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  over the years for leaving graphic and violent stuff up. And I think their instincts are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=215.9s)]
*  to over moderate now and to take stuff down. Most of this content is taken down by artificial [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=222.02s)]
*  intelligence. It automatically finds things like violence, pornography or child abuse. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  We wanted to see how it worked. So we contacted Hive, a company that provides sites like Reddit [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=234.22s)]
*  with AI software to moderate their platforms. They gave us an account and we uploaded videos [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=239.5s)]
*  to test it. The programme searches for things like blood, corpse or nudity and gives a score [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  from 0 to 1. A higher score means the machine is more confident in what it identified. It [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=250.66s)]
*  correctly found dead bodies in our videos, like these, which got more than 0.9. This [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=256.62s)]
*  result means the video is likely to be removed automatically without being flagged for review. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=261.82s)]
*  Major platforms claim graphic content from war zones can stay online if it's in the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=269.72s)]
*  public interest. But our experiment suggests the opposite. We decided to see what the platforms [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=273.7s)]
*  would do with the videos we tested. Instagram took down three of four within a minute. YouTube [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=279.62s)]
*  age-restricted the same three, but ten minutes later removed them all and gave us this warning. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  We tried again, but they failed to upload altogether. And then our appeal to restore [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=292.5s)]
*  the videos was rejected. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=297.42s)]
*  We saw civilian bodies. Then they shot and burned cars. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=309.54s)]
*  The videos we tried to upload were filmed by Igor from Ukraine. He used to be a travel [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=320.3s)]
*  journalist, but since the Russian invasion, he's been documenting attacks on civilians. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=329.5s)]
*  Like this one, on a road outside Kyiv. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=337.5s)]
*  It was clear that these were people who lived near Kyiv and they wanted to leave the occupation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=341.5s)]
*  They were, of course, family. They were men, women, children, older people. They were just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=348.5s)]
*  being shot. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=357.5s)]
*  Igor posted the videos on Facebook and Instagram. They were immediately taken down. He wanted [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=361.5s)]
*  to share the images to challenge the Kremlin's claim that the murder of civilians never happened. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=368.5s)]
*  The Russian-Ukrainian allies said that there was nothing to do with the civilians. They [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=373.5s)]
*  were fighting only with the Ukrainian army. It was very important not only to remove these [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=378.5s)]
*  confirmations, but also to spread them quickly. The whole world had to see it all. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=385.5s)]
*  This is a video of a bombing of a central hospital in Izium in Ukraine. This is a video [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=396.5s)]
*  of shooting protesters in Khartoum in Sudan. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=404.5s)]
*  In order to save videos like these, some have taken it upon themselves to preserve them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=409.5s)]
*  Mnemonic is an archiving organisation based in Berlin. Their small team has created a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=415.5s)]
*  tool that quickly and automatically downloads and preserves footage from war zones before [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=420.5s)]
*  it's deleted. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=425.5s)]
*  On a daily basis, we monitor different countries for any content that is uploaded to social [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=426.5s)]
*  media. We archive this content related to different types of human rights violations [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=435.5s)]
*  such as the use of illegal munitions like chemical weapons or cluster munitions. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=440.5s)]
*  They've saved well over 700,000 images from war zones before they were removed from social [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=445.5s)]
*  media, including three videos of the attack on the market in Aleppo where Imad witnessed [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=451.5s)]
*  his friends and customers die. But their limited resources mean they can only focus on a few [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=456.5s)]
*  of the world's countless areas of conflict, leaving others to fill the gaps. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=462.5s)]
*  Rawah lives in the United States and has family in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region. In recent [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=472.5s)]
*  years, the country has been racked with violence. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=478.5s)]
*  I knew what I was looking at was horrible. I've never looked at stuff like that before. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=483.5s)]
*  From her New York flat, she spends her spare time watching videos with dead bodies. It's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=490.5s)]
*  been two years now. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=495.5s)]
*  It was a sense of duty. It was just hard. I think the work was hard. I think the work [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=497.5s)]
*  was hard. I spent hours doing research. And so when you're seeing this content trickle [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=507.5s)]
*  in and you're trying to verify it using whatever open source intelligent tools you can get [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=514.5s)]
*  hands on, but you don't know if your family's okay, that's really hard. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=520.5s)]
*  Shootings, massacres, mutilation, all of these were saved by Rawah and other members of her [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=527.5s)]
*  family. She says they feel compelled to document what's happening thousands of miles away, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=534.5s)]
*  as Ethiopia's authorities tightly control the flow of information. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=539.5s)]
*  All we had outside of regional and government backed TV programs that were coming out, the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=544.5s)]
*  only glimpse into what was going on back home was through social media. We all felt that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=553.5s)]
*  we had the responsibility to archive this information and be active online to preserve [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=560.5s)]
*  this event. But I've seen things already get deleted and we've tried, as a community, we [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=566.5s)]
*  tried to track some videos down and we couldn't. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=572.5s)]
*  When videos are deleted, they pretty much become inaccessible. Social media companies [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=575.5s)]
*  don't have any obligation to give them to private individuals, human rights groups or [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=580.5s)]
*  lawyers. The only organizations who can demand access are national law enforcement agencies. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=584.5s)]
*  But even this isn't straightforward. Investigators need to provide the precise URL for the video [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=589.5s)]
*  they're looking for, which might be years after the incident. The complicated process [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=595.5s)]
*  and huge time involved is why the US State Department's Office of Global Criminal Justice [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=600.5s)]
*  says content must be preserved for years. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=605.5s)]
*  We have already had situations in which the information that was on social media platforms, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=608.5s)]
*  such as Facebook or otherwise, has been used as evidence in a court of law. And so we need [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=614.5s)]
*  to be able to preserve this so that the potential evidentiary value can later be mined when we have [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=618.5s)]
*  a better understanding about what happened and who might be responsible. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=624.5s)]
*  Human rights organizations say the answer is to warn users that a video is graphic and keep it [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=627.5s)]
*  online, or to remove it but create an independent archive for deleted footage from war zones. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=632.5s)]
*  This would protect people while allowing the videos to be preserved for possible future use as evidence. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=638.5s)]
*  We're asking the social media companies to allow for a system that international investigators [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=644.5s)]
*  could use to get access to content that's been taken down to investigate potential war crimes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=651.5s)]
*  Activists say the major social media platforms claim they're open to the idea but have yet to act. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=658.5s)]
*  We have been engaging with the companies for years now on this topic and in these meetings they say all [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=664.5s)]
*  the right things. They say that they're dedicated to ensuring accountability and they want their [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=669.5s)]
*  platforms to help ensure that accountability. In reality, they haven't been willing to take any real [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=675.5s)]
*  tangible steps to solve this bigger problem. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=681.5s)]
*  We asked YouTube, Twitter and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, what they think about that idea [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=685.5s)]
*  and requested an interview. They declined. Meta and YouTube sent comments. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=691.5s)]
*  Music [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=699.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, people affected by wars are doing what they can to ensure evidence and history aren't lost. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=722.5s)]
*  When I'm thinking about what does justice look like, it's really putting this material forward to show [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=744.5s)]
*  that we haven't forgotten about you. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwPVns4YJI&t=750.5s)]
