Video Description: The UN is urging Syria's interim leaders to take swift action to protect civilians  following a wave of violence against members of the minority Alawite community. 

The violence began after loyalists of former President Bashar al-Assad - whose regime was toppled last December - ambushed government forces in recent days.   

Government security forces are said to have been carrying out reprisals in Latakia Province, where at least 1,000 Alawites, including children are said to have been killed in recent days.  The BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll.

The Alawites are a minority sect of Shia Muslims, from which the Assad family originates.

Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa – who played a leading role in the rebellion that toppled Assad – has called for peace and announced an investigation into the violence. But so far, he hasn't directly addressed accusations that atrocities were being committed by his supporters.  Syrians have been protesting against the violence in the capital Damascus.

The UN says it's received "extremely disturbing" reports of whole families being killed, and has called on the interim authorities to take "swift actions to protect Syrians" while the US says the Syrian leadership must hold the perpetrators accountable.

Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lina Sinjab in Damascus.
