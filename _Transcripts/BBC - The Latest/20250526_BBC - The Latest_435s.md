Video Description: At least 54 Palestinians have been killed - most of them in a school building sheltering displaced families - during Israeli air strikes on Gaza overnight, hospital directors have told the BBC.
 
Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City was housing hundreds of people from Beit Lahia, currently under intense Israeli military assault. At least 35 were reported to have been killed when the school was hit.
 
Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence said multiple bodies, including those of children, were recovered â€“ many severely burned, after fires engulfed two classrooms serving as living quarters.
 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted "a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre" there.

*  Welcome back. Let's return to our top story. More than 50 Palestinians have been killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=0.0s)]

*  on the Israelis to allow more aid into Gaza. Israel does not allow international media [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=19.28s)]
*  organizations, including the BBC, to report from Gaza. From Jerusalem, here's Yulanda. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=23.86s)]
*  Little Warda Asher Khalil made it out alive, but her mother and two older siblings did [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=30.0s)]
*  not. A classroom turned shelter turned inferno overnight. Israel's military says it attacked [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=41.28s)]
*  what it called key terrorists here in Gaza City and took steps to stop civilians getting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=51.44s)]
*  hurt. But children were killed. It was horrific, says one displaced mother pulled from the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=57.24s)]
*  rubble with her son. It was indescribable. Body parts, charred bodies, the smell of burning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=63.82s)]
*  I swear to God, our hearts have died. We're shaken. We're exhausted enough. Those killed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=72.76s)]
*  in their sleep were carried to their final resting places today. And the number of dead [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  continues to rise. 17 members of one family reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=87.06s)]
*  the north. As Israel's military steps up its offensive, the chief of staff says Hamas is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=92.74s)]
*  under immense pressure. Israel plans to seize all of Gaza. A big supporter of that is its [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=99.66s)]
*  hardline minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, marking Israel's Jerusalem day with a provocative [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=109.14s)]

*  the hostages, that they all return home safely and for victory in the war. There's mass hunger [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=121.86s)]
*  in Gaza, even after Israel eased its two month long total blockade last week. It wants aid [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=128.74s)]
*  delivery to be taken over by a new organisation, but its head has now resigned, saying the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=135.5s)]
*  idea doesn't stick to humanitarian principles. Today, young Warda returned to the ruins of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=141.74s)]

*  now join your land live in Jerusalem. Let's focus a bit firstly then your land on aid. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=162.58s)]
*  The Gaza humanitarian foundation, it's controversial, it's backed by the US and by Israel, but it's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=168.94s)]
*  so complicated getting aid in and they say they've started to begin their work there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=176.02s)]
*  How much do we know about what they're doing and how they're going to move around, how [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=181.9s)]
*  they plan to distribute aid? Well, first of all, remember that aid is still in dangerously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=185.42s)]
*  short supply across the entire Gaza Strip, despite the fact that Israel did begin to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=192.52s)]
*  ease slightly. It's total blockade that has gone on for 11 weeks just one week ago. Now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=198.7s)]
*  we had a statement from this newly created Gaza humanitarian foundation early in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=204.94s)]
*  day saying that its trucks were loaded and ready to go. It planned in the next week to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=210.22s)]
*  reach one million Palestinians, that's half of the population of the Strip. It's supposed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=216.26s)]
*  to be working out of this handful of distribution sites really concentrated in the south and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  its work will involve using armed security contractors and having Gazans, one representative [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=227.74s)]
*  of each family who's been specially screened crossing Israeli military lines to pick up [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=235.34s)]
*  supplies of food for their family on foot. It's supposed to last them then several days. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=241.02s)]
*  And you know, it's been already sort of dismissed by the UN and other aid agencies that have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=247.3s)]
*  been working in Gaza as being unethical and unworkable. Remember that they operate or [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=253.46s)]
*  have been operating out of something like 400 distribution points. And then just underscoring [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=259.66s)]
*  all the confusion that there is around this newly created organization. We had the executive [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=265.54s)]
*  director Jake Wood, he's a former US Marine turned social entrepreneur, announcing his [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=272.18s)]
*  resignation. He said that was because the plan could not adhere to humanitarian principles, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=279.46s)]
*  neutrality, impartiality, independence, similar to the criticisms that we've been having from [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=284.34s)]
*  the UN. But still, you know, Israel says that it wants to change the way that aid is distributed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza. It claims that significant amount of supplies have been diverted to Hamas, something [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  that Hamas denies with the UN and others saying that they have had strong supervision mechanisms [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=302.06s)]
*  to make sure that doesn't happen. And on the ground, Yourland, we're hearing at least 54 [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians were killed overnight. And then in the past hour or so, reports that another [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=312.5s)]
*  evacuation order has been issued for Khan Yunus. Where will people go? That's right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=318.22s)]
*  People have been told to leave Khan Yunus, in particular to head westwards towards this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=325.54s)]
*  area along the coast. This is after three rockets were fired from southern Gaza earlier [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=330.9s)]
*  in the day, the Israeli military says, with two of those actually landing inside the strip [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=338.26s)]
*  and one of them intercepted. And, you know, already people in Khan Yunus have been fleeing, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=343.34s)]
*  making that journey. And there is now this plan which is causing a lot of worry being [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=350.02s)]
*  reported in the Israeli media with the army said to be planning over the next two months [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=355.06s)]
*  to take 75% of the Gaza strip and move the two million people of Gaza into three areas, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=362.18s)]
*  one in the south, one in the centre, one in the heart of Gaza City. Yourland, as we're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=371.1s)]
*  speaking, I'm also just monitoring the news wires and we're getting some alerts from Palestinian [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=376.14s)]
*  sources who are talking about a new ceasefire deal. What are they referencing there? Do [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=381.5s)]
*  you know? What are the developments on that front? I mean, there have been some reports [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=389.54s)]
*  that we've not had confirmed to us of a back channel between Hamas and the Trump administration [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=395.46s)]
*  proposing a 70 day ceasefire for the return of 10 of the hostages that Hamas is still [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=402.26s)]
*  holding. Of course, it's believed that at least 20 of the hostages are still alive being [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=409.34s)]
*  held inside Gaza. But this is very unclear, the picture that's gone at the moment. There's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  certainly not been any confirmation that this is something realistic from the Israeli side. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=421.26s)]
*  We did hear as well that there were some talks that were scheduled to happen in Cairo with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  Egypt being such an important key mediator in the region. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bT9NpOKZY&t=431.53999999999996s)]
