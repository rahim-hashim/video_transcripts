**BBC - The Latest:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o)
*  Now in Gaza, the civil defense agency says Israeli forces have killed 23 people waiting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=0.0s)]
*  for aid near a distribution site in the center of the Palestinian territory. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=6.4s)]
*  Around 150 people have also been injured. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=11.16s)]
*  The UN Human Rights Office says more than 500 people have been killed trying to reach [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=13.94s)]
*  those aid points, which are now run by the US and Israeli governments. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=18.42s)]
*  A UN official has described the system as an abomination and a death trap. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=22.28s)]
*  The UN rejects allegations that it has committed war crimes in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=28.28s)]
*  Tamara Al-Refai is the director of external relations and communications with UNRWA, the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=32.92s)]
*  UN's aid agency in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=38.0s)]
*  I spoke with her a little earlier and she described the aid situation on the ground. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=39.68s)]
*  We are here talking about a population of over two million people in Gaza who are desperate, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=45.52s)]
*  who are scared, exhausted and displaced multiple times, having lost everything. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=53.8s)]
*  Amidst this catastrophic humanitarian situation, the international aid system spearheaded by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=61.0s)]
*  the UN is so highly restricted that it's not able to do its job, primarily distributing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=69.32s)]
*  food to a population where famine is being reported. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=76.56s)]
*  In the middle of this, the government of Israel decides to parachute a new system [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=82.38s)]
*  that it calls an aid mechanism, but that is everything but not humanitarian. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=90.3s)]
*  If anything, every time Palestinians have gathered at the distribution point of that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=98.74s)]
*  so-called aid system, many of them have been killed tragically, like this morning, because [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  that system does not have the know-how, it does not have the mechanisms, it is not spread [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=111.22s)]
*  across the Gaza Strip, so it's forcing people to walk for miles on end to get to the distribution [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=117.08s)]
*  and it's putting people in cages in such a humiliating, undignified way while they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  desperate and waiting for food to take back to their families. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=129.28s)]
*  It is everything but humanitarian. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=132.74s)]
*  We had a spokesperson for the IDF on the programme yesterday and they said that they have let [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=135.42s)]
*  other aid in across the border to Gaza, but it's sitting there waiting for distribution [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=140.74s)]
*  by humanitarian organisations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=146.22s)]
*  Have you had that experience? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  Have you been permitted to bring aid in but not to distribute it? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=150.4s)]
*  UNRWA has not been permitted to bring aid in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  If anything, the government of Israel approved two laws at the beginning of this year, one [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=157.78s)]
*  of them effectively banning us from being able to go into Gaza because banning us, UNRWA, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=163.46s)]
*  the largest humanitarian agency in Gaza, banning us from any contact with the government [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=170.3s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=175.34s)]
*  So we've had no permits to go in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=176.34s)]
*  We have over 3,000 trucks full of goods sitting outside Gaza, in Egypt, in Jordan, that are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  ready to go in with food and non-food supplies, medical supplies, tents, etc., but we have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=189.62s)]
*  not been able to. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=194.74s)]
*  Having said that, there has been a trickle of international aid going in as of late, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=196.26s)]
*  but again it's a drop within a population of more than 2 million people who are being [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  starved by design. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=210.38s)]
*  Has the United Nations had any recent discussions with Israel about changing their methodology [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  that they're using at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to let the UN, to let humanitarian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=220.06s)]
*  agencies once again take charge of delivering aid? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=225.26s)]
*  The UN as a whole has not stopped discussing with the Israeli authorities the role that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=230.22s)]
*  the UN should be allowed to play in Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=239.66s)]
*  So at the level of the UN Secretary General, at the level of the heads of UN agencies, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=243.18s)]
*  of Ocha, everybody in the UN stands united. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=250.34s)]
*  This is one of the biggest humanitarian crises in recent times in Gaza, and this is a place [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=254.66s)]
*  where the UN has so much expertise, where UNRWA has the trust of the population, where [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=263.82s)]
*  UNRWA by the way continues to run services. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=270.3s)]
*  We continue to run primary health care. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=272.8s)]
*  We continue to give 15,000 consultations, medical consultations per day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=275.34s)]
*  We continue to work on providing clean drinking water and managing solid waste to avert a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  health crisis, public health crisis. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  There is a lot for the international system to do and the international system knows how [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=290.34s)]
*  to do it and can do it if it's allowed, but for now it's not being allowed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMbqqRjx0o&t=295.29999999999995s)]
