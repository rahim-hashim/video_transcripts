Video Description: Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky in the UK.
 
This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen at the same time until 2040.
 
The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

# When and how to see seven planets align in night sky in rare ‘planetary parade’ | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4)
*  Be sure to be looking skywards on Friday night because you are in for a treat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=0.0s)]
*  All seven of the other planets in our solar system are going to be appearing in the night sky at the same time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=5.0s)]
*  It's known as a great planetary alignment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=11.0s)]
*  Rebecca Allen is an astronomer at Swinburne University and told us what we can expect. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=14.0s)]
*  Well, this year we've already been treated to several of the major planets in the night sky at the same time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=20.0s)]
*  And at the end of this week, we'll have an even rarer treat when Mercury joins the planet parade, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=26.0s)]
*  meaning all seven of the great planets will be visible in the night sky at the same time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=31.0s)]
*  Most of them actually even visible with the naked eye. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=37.0s)]
*  So you will want to go out shortly after sunset because Saturn, Mercury and Venus are all very close to the sun right now, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=40.0s)]
*  while Jupiter and Mars are further to the east. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=48.0s)]
*  And so to capture all of them in the short window, I really recommend going out just after sunset. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=51.0s)]
*  In order to see all of the planets in the night sky at the same time is quite rare. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=56.0s)]
*  We only see this kind of alignment once a decade or so. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=61.0s)]
*  But to actually see them in the specific order there in the night sky is more like something that would happen every hundred years or so. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=65.0s)]
*  And furthermore, we actually don't have the full moon, including our view of any of the planets at the end of the week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=73.0s)]
*  So we actually have a dark sky as well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=79.0s)]
*  And most of the world will be able to see this unless you're at the very, very furthest north latitudes, you'll be able to be treated to the show. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=81.0s)]
*  So again, you really want a clear view of the western horizon and try to go out just after sunset and try to see how many planets you can see. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=89.0s)]
*  Of course, take your binoculars out for Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=97.0s)]
*  But you should be able to spot Venus pretty quickly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=101.0s)]
*  And then from there, jump to the constellation Orion, where Jupiter will be hanging out near Betelgeuse and the bright star Aldebaran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=104.0s)]
*  And then you should be able to find Mars after that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=112.0s)]
*  So I really encourage everyone. It's a great family activity because hopefully the kiddos won't be in bed yet. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=114.0s)]
*  And hopefully there will be clear skies, fingers crossed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAGaNBSk4&t=119.0s)]
