Video Description: US President Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants is continuing to cause fear in communities across the country.
 
President Trump has previously said that he has no choice, and that deporting those who are in the country legally is "common sense".
 
But there is an economic consequence to these deportations - many small businesses are owned by undocumented migrants, or rely on them as workers.

*  immigrants, from where our correspondent Michelle Flory sent in this report. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=29.92s)]

*  She runs this 11-year-old restaurant in Staten Island with her father. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=42.88s)]

*  I still feel like I'm being persecuted, like I'm being hunted down. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=50.2s)]
*  It has taken on a new sense of urgency with President Trump's plans for mass deportation [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=56.08s)]
*  and led to some tough conversations with her staff. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=61.6s)]
*  I had a cook say to me, I'm scared to go home because I don't know if I will make it home. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=64.84s)]
*  I don't know if I will be stopped along the way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=70.64s)]
*  I've seen business go down. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=73.36s)]
*  There's much fewer customers coming around. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=75.44s)]
*  Despite her family's contributions to the local community, she's worried about the future. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=79.28s)]
*  I'm college-educated, a business owner of multiple businesses. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=84.6s)]
*  I do right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=89.36s)]
*  I'm part of the community, but I'm still considered a criminal because of what, of coming into [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  the country as a child. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=98.64s)]
*  And I don't have a legal pathway to fix that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=101.28s)]
*  On the same day the Department of Justice sued New York over its immigration policies, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  a vigil was held in the city to support migrants and promise sanctuary to the undocumented. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=109.32s)]
*  For those caught up in Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, this isn't just a personal tragedy, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  it's an economic one for their communities, who rely on their labor, their tax revenues [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  and the money they spend in local businesses. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=127.56s)]
*  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=130.68s)]

*  She's managing director of the Renaissance Project, a non-profit that finances immigrant [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=138.32s)]
*  businesses. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=143.28s)]
*  This fear is new. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=144.6s)]
*  We didn't experience this the first time around, but this time we do see that type of concern. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=145.94s)]
*  This one is for birds. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=153.28s)]
*  We trap them and release them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Raymond Lu runs a business employing 70 people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=157.56s)]
*  He came to the U.S. legally from China and understands what motivates people to seek [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  a life here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=165.6s)]
*  I would imagine everybody come to the country, legal or illegal, we want to work hard and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=166.6s)]
*  just do well, establish ourselves. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=173.28s)]
*  That's the American dream. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=176.6s)]
*  The threats and hurdles are working. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=180.72s)]
*  People are scared, with immigrant communities feeling the strain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=183.24s)]
*  Michelle Flurry, BBC News, New York. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  What challenges are the over half a million black undocumented migrants going through [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=193.16s)]
*  in the United States at the moment? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=197.72s)]
*  Earlier, I spoke to Sylvie Bello, the founder of the Cameroon American Council. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=199.72s)]
*  I began by asking her to explain what immigration actions the Trump administration had taken [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  so far. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Pretty much just revived some of his old first-term policies, things like remain in Mexico, which [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=212.72s)]
*  basically means that if you're at the border, predominantly the southern border, you just [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=220.18s)]
*  sit there and wait for asylum. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=225.86s)]
*  If you're granted asylum, then you come into the United States. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  So, that he just revived. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=231.06s)]
*  Things like the African ban or as others have called it, the Muslim ban, we at the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=233.38s)]
*  Cameroon American Council, we call it the African ban because many of the countries [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  on that ban, Somalia, Libya, are African countries. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=242.9s)]
*  With the Muslim ban slash African ban, pretty much he's saying the people from predominantly [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=249.98s)]
*  Muslim countries will have just a harder time getting through. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  So, those are some of the policies that he just revived from Trump 1. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=259.18s)]
*  President Biden, for instance, refused to extend TPS for South Sudan and Cameroon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=264.9s)]
*  We don't expect Trump to extend it either, but we're fighting for it, though. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump did was that he actually cut TPS, and TPS, for those who may not know, is temporary [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=276.06s)]
*  protector status. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=282.38s)]
*  It's for undocumented people who are in the U.S. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=283.7s)]
*  So, even with Trump 1, he cut TPS for Ebola-affected countries, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=286.62s)]
*  Some of the new things, though, that he's introduced is the birthright citizenship, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=294.1s)]
*  where he's claiming that he can basically decide that if you're born in the U.S. to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=300.02s)]
*  parents who are undocumented, you're not a U.S. citizen. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=307.94s)]
*  What have they done in terms of uncertainty for small business owners, for example, who [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=310.82s)]
*  have hired or are undocumented migrants themselves? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=315.7s)]
*  How has it affected how they are doing business in the communities that you interact with? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=319.18s)]
*  It has really caused a lot of folks' businesses to shut down. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=323.94s)]
*  For instance, a lot of construction sites have been on standstill because those with [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=328.98s)]
*  papers and those without papers don't even come to work. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=338.78s)]
*  Because when they come to pick you, you don't know who they're going to pick. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=341.22s)]
*  You don't know who they're going to harass. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=343.22s)]
*  How do you respond to those who say that there were many who were taking advantage of loopholes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=344.22s)]
*  within the immigration system to stay illegally, to operate illegally in the United States, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=349.06s)]
*  that everybody must follow the law? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=357.38s)]
*  You must follow the law when the law is applied evenly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=358.38s)]
*  So there will be loopholes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=361.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  Because when you don't apply the law, when there's anti-blackness, when you don't, for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=364.42s)]
*  instance, there are policies like humanitarian parole. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=367.94s)]
*  Do you know that Ukraine, within a month of the war in Ukraine, Ukraine was able to get [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=370.62s)]
*  an immigration relief called humanitarian parole? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=376.02s)]
*  Cameroon has had not one, not two, but five armed conflicts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=377.9s)]
*  And for the past 10 years, we've been asking for humanitarian parole. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=381.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=383.86s)]
*  For instance, right now, when Trump came in, he took out TPS for Venezuela, did not take [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=384.94s)]
*  out TPS for Ukraine. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=389.66s)]
*  It just goes to show that we have policies that are just not applied evenly. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=391.14s)]
*  And when that doesn't, when there's that kind of unequals, it would create loopholes for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=395.14s)]
*  people to survive. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5mJEhq334&t=400.62s)]
