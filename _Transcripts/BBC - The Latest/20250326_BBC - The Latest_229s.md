Video Description: US Vice-President JD Vance will join his wife Usha in travelling to Greenland on Friday, a visit that follows Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.
 
The couple will go to the Pituffik Space Base to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet members of US forces stationed there, according to the White House.
 
Usha Vance had planned to travel to the Danish territory on a cultural visit before her husband announced his plans. Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is also set to visit this week on a separate trip.
 
Officials in Greenland have fiercely criticised the planned visits as disrespectful.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs)
*  Greenland's politicians have condemned plans for high-profile US visits in the wake of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's threats to take over the island. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=4.84s)]
*  Second Lady Usha Vance will make a cultural trip later this week and a separate visit [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=8.0s)]
*  is expected from Mike Waltz, the embattled national security adviser to Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=12.1s)]
*  Speaking to the newspaper Sermat Siak, outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Muta Aghedi said [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=17.68s)]
*  the only purpose of the visits is to show a demonstration of power to the US. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=22.92s)]
*  Speaking earlier, the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticised the US in connection [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=28.32s)]
*  to the visit, calling it an unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=32.96s)]
*  She also rejected that it's a private visit as the Americans have otherwise claimed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=37.76s)]
*  You cannot arrange a private visit with official representatives from another country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=42.76s)]
*  A visit to Greenland where the acting Greenlandic government has very clearly stated they do [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=48.96s)]
*  not want a visit right now because there is no government, so such official meetings cannot [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=54.16s)]
*  be held. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I have said several times since January 7th that I and we take this situation very seriously. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  President Trump is serious and he is earnest. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=68.44s)]
*  He wants Greenland. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=71.32s)]
*  Earlier I spoke to Danish journalist Martin Selsoe-Storrensen who told me how people in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=72.32s)]
*  Greenland are feeling right now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=78.08s)]
*  People here are looking at it with a mixture of anger and suspicion because the Americans [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=80.4s)]
*  generally are most welcome to come here as tourists or as investors. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  But in this particular case they are coming without an invitation, without an official [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=90.76s)]
*  host and it comes of course on the backdrop of these very sinister comments coming from [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=95.2s)]
*  the White House in recent months about a possible takeover by America of Greenland about the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=100.2s)]
*  use of force, military force, about annexation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  So people are very wary about this visit coming up this week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=108.42s)]
*  Usjavans has said she is very interested in the cultural links and ties and the history. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=111.42s)]
*  What is the situation on the ground if it isn't a formal invite? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=121.26s)]
*  How do these trips get managed? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=124.98s)]
*  Well as far as we know they have been invited by the organisation who runs this dogsled [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=128.02s)]
*  place on Saturday and where Usjavans will be a participant. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=133.34s)]
*  But again there's no formal organisation here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=138.74s)]
*  We know some individuals from Greenland have reached out to people around President Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=141.22s)]
*  perhaps in the administration as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=145.56s)]
*  And Americans themselves are organising this visit and very little is known about the actual [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=147.94s)]
*  programme who they're going to see, where they're going to visit except for this dogsled [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=152.06s)]
*  race and as far as we know National Security Advisor Mike Walz will be in Pitufik Airbase [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=155.62s)]
*  also known as Tule Airbase up in the Far North. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=160.72s)]
*  Are you anticipating any sort of form of public protest? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=163.52s)]
*  I mean are people getting seriously worried about the American view on this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=166.16s)]
*  They are very worried but the Greenlanders are also very, I would say very quiet people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=170.6s)]
*  So what we have heard is that obviously the dogsled race will take place on Saturday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=175.6s)]
*  People are planning a silent protest where they say they will stand along the route where [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=180.4s)]
*  she will travel and they will turn their backs quietly to her to signal to the Americans [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=184.24s)]
*  that they don't like their ambitions for Greenland. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=188.88s)]
*  And just very briefly we know that in recent polls almost 80% of Greenlanders have backed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=192.72s)]
*  independence from Denmark but even more of them don't want to become part of the United [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean realistically what power do people there have if Trump pushes this agenda? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=203.28s)]
*  Well Greenland doesn't have a defense of its own and Denmark has a very small defense here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=209.68s)]
*  The thing is Greenland being a part of Denmark is also a part of NATO. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=214.32s)]
*  So America is the great ally that should be part of the protection of Greenland. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=217.76s)]
*  So that adds to the oddity of this situation that the country that should be part of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  defense now seems to be on the attack. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDQN9LLMBs&t=227.12s)]
