*  Commission, said this morning that leaders were meeting to re-arm Europe and further cement their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=12.24s)]
*  support for Ukraine. She says extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=18.0s)]
*  This is a watershed moment for Europe and Ukraine is part of our European family. It's also a watershed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=23.76s)]
*  moment for Ukraine. Europe faces a clear and present danger and therefore Europe has to be able to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=31.12s)]
*  protect itself, to defend itself as we have to put Ukraine in a position to protect itself [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=39.28s)]
*  and to push for lasting and just peace. We want a peaceful strength and this is the reason why [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I present today to the leaders the Rearm Europe Plan. The Rearm Europe Plan provides up to 800 [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=55.92s)]
*  billion euros for defence investment. It gives the member states fiscal space to invest in defence, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=63.44s)]
*  it gives the member states possibility to invest in the Ukrainian defence industry [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=71.28s)]
*  or to procure military capabilities that go right away to Ukraine. So it is to the benefit of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=77.12s)]
*  re-arming Europe, re-arming the European Union but also arming Ukraine in its existential fight [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=84.08s)]
*  for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Well Ukraine's president Zelensky also addressed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=91.52s)]
*  the press ahead of the summit saying that he is grateful for European support. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=97.76s)]
*  We are very thankful that we are not alone and these are not just words we feel it. It's very [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=103.2s)]
*  important you made a strong signal to Ukrainian people, to Ukrainian warriors, to civilians, to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=109.2s)]
*  all our families and it's great that we are not alone. We feel it and we know it. Thank you so [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  much for everything and signals to increase our production and signals to with the new programme [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=122.24s)]
*  to increase the European security. That's I think the great decisions. Thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=130.0s)]
*  President Zelensky there on his way into that meeting. Let's just show you some pictures [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  live from inside the meeting room. We are expecting some of those leaders to address, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=143.04s)]
*  to give us a few words before that meeting starts. Let's go to Nick Beek who is in Brussels, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=148.72s)]
*  who was in the building when President Zelensky arrived and Ursula von der Leyen said that this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=152.88s)]
*  is a watershed moment for Europe, Nick. She did Sarah and I think it was really interesting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=159.76s)]
*  watching President Zelensky, he was just a few metres away from us. The reception he got, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=165.2s)]
*  the warm reception, the arms that were put round his shoulder, the fact that he was there with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=171.2s)]
*  us for quite a while so all the cameras could capture this, images that will be sent and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=176.56s)]
*  viewed by the Kremlin and by the White House. In terms of what they can achieve today, this is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=182.32s)]
*  an emergency summit so it hasn't been weeks and months in the planning so there isn't a big list [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=188.16s)]
*  of things they are going to tick off and agree on. Of course, even if there is agreement. So I think [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=193.12s)]
*  there will be more strong words later but in the here and now, President Zelensky desperately wants [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=198.0s)]
*  this help, particularly if the Americans are stepping back in terms of military supplies [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=204.16s)]
*  they are sending and not sharing intelligence with Ukraine. So that is one thing they are looking at [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=209.84s)]
*  as a matter of urgency and then on the other hand they are talking about investing billions of euros [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  in the defence industry in Europe in the years and decades to come. The pictures have just cut away [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=222.16s)]
*  from those leaders inside the meeting room. Just give us an idea of the timetable of today and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=228.56s)]
*  what we might expect at the end of the meeting. We have got an indication of the discussions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=233.84s)]
*  happening today from the arrivals when the various politicians arrived, the leaders and some of them [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=239.6s)]
*  chose to speak. An interesting thing, Sarah, just catching up on a few of the things that were said, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=245.36s)]
*  Donald Tusk, who is the Polish Prime Minister, who used to actually chair the meeting of the 27 EU [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=251.68s)]
*  countries, he was saying that the first priority needs to be to secure the EU's border. So he is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=258.64s)]
*  looking at possible aggression from Russia in the future on EU soil, whether that is the Baltic [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=265.2s)]
*  States or elsewhere. So that is one thing they will be looking at. Also, I think what may come [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=272.72s)]
*  up today, even though it is not really on the agenda, is what President Macron of France has [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=279.52s)]
*  been talking about. He has been raising the possibility of France using their so-called [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=283.92s)]
*  nuclear shield, their nuclear capabilities, and extending it to other countries, maybe Germany, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=289.44s)]
*  for example, if the Americans are going to walk away from European security. Today we heard a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=295.44s)]
*  few people saying, actually, that sounds like a good idea, but Olaf Scholz, who is the German [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=301.04s)]
*  leader, not for much longer, he was saying, well, Europe should not give up on US nuclear deterrent. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  So I think lots of different speeds that leaders want to work at may be different directions, but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=311.28s)]
*  all agree this is a really critical moment and it cannot be a question of lots of platitudes and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=317.52s)]
*  nothing comes out of it in the coming weeks and months. OK, Nick, Ian Brussels there for the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  moment. Thank you. We will cut back to that meeting in Brussels. If there are any public words before [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  that meeting gets underway, we will let you know if and when that does happen. Let's go to my [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=334.96s)]
*  colleague Vitaly Shevchenko just to talk about the implications of this. Vitaly, really strong words [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=340.0s)]
*  as those leaders went into that meeting, really talking about this being a watershed moment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=346.56s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=351.6s)]
*  That was my colleague Vitaly Shevchenko. There's clearly a slight issue with his line there. We [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=355.92s)]
*  will try and get back to him at the moment. As I say, we were expecting to see some pictures, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=362.0s)]
*  maybe hear some words, some more words from that meeting there in Brussels. But I'm just looking at [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=368.4s)]
*  the pictures at the moment. There we go. There's more leaders arriving. That meeting is due to get [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  underway. And as we've been talking about, there are two real agendas there today. They're talking [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  about boosting European defence spending. Spend, spend, spend. That is what we heard from the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=390.08s)]
*  leaders there, what they would be talking about. But also, of course, expressing support for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=397.28s)]
*  Ukraine. President Zelensky very much a part of that meeting. So we will return to Brussels [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  when that meeting is underway and when we've got a little bit more. Let's talk about the UK [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  defence secretary because he is expected to discuss the US decision to pause intelligent [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=415.44s)]
*  sharing with Ukraine with his counterpart in Washington today. John Healy will join Pete [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  Hegseth on Thursday for a bilateral meeting on a possible peace plan while efforts continue to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  bridge a transatlantic rift, this over the country's future security. And it is worth saying that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=434.08s)]
*  Sakhir Starmer isn't at that meeting in Brussels. There are 27 leaders there. Sakhir Starmer not [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=439.52s)]
*  there today. But as we say, John Healy will be meeting the US defence secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=444.88s)]
*  in Washington to talk about that transatlantic issues. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i3lHBdhk0&t=450.56s)]
