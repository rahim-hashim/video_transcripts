*  Both the Cameroonian authorities and armed Anglophone separatist groups have fought hard [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=50.56s)]
*  to silence journalists in their reporting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=55.96s)]

*  And funerals like these have become all too common in this part of Cameroon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=81.36s)]
*  This was John Simabia's funeral, an Anglophone government civil servant. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=95.52000000000001s)]

*  in this predominantly Francophone country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  And in late 2016 peaceful protests began to demand an end to the marginalisation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  Cameroon's government responded with violence. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=161.23999999999998s)]

*  has been set ablaze or you hear that someone was kidnapped. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=198.28s)]
*  Was very difficult. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=203.2s)]

*  a target for separatists. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=232.56s)]
*  As well as attacks like this, schools have also become targets, considered by some separatists [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=245.04s)]

*  the Cameroonian diaspora. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  As separatists persist in fighting for an independent ambazonia, the government has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=303.16s)]
*  also escalated its own violent response. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Burning villages like in this video, raping women, torture, unlawful arrests and extrajudicial [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvoUnOYklI&t=326.64s)]
