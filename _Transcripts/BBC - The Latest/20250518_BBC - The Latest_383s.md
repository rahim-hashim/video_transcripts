**BBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg)
*  Stunning lakeside views and postcard perfect scenery, Lugano is tucked into Switzerland's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=0.0s)]
*  southernmost canton. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=11.16s)]
*  But aside from its beautiful landscape, there's one other jewel in the crown of this Swiss [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=13.16s)]
*  Mediterranean city. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=19.96s)]
*  Computational power. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=23.92s)]
*  This is the home of Alps. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=28.16s)]
*  Not the mountains, but a different kind of giant. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=30.08s)]
*  One of the world's most advanced supercomputers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=33.84s)]
*  It's the latest generation of high-performance computing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=37.44s)]
*  Imagine you have your laptop. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=41.56s)]
*  But now imagine that you have 10,000 or 20,000 of those laptops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=42.56s)]
*  So here you look at extremely capable processors that are more capable than your laptop processor [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and you're looking at nearly 11,000 of those. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  It's a supercomputing center. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=56.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=58.18s)]
*  But such power comes at a cost. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=59.18s)]
*  Heat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=61.9s)]
*  And a lot of it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=62.9s)]
*  This isn't your average data center full of noisy fans and air-conditioned chillers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=64.58s)]
*  Instead, what's impressive about this place isn't just its brain power, it's how it's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=69.98s)]
*  run. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=76.18s)]
*  Built not only for speed, but also sustainability. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=77.18s)]
*  Alps draws from the same source that has sustained Switzerland for millennia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=81.42s)]
*  Glacial water. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=85.98s)]
*  When you think of supercomputers, you don't necessarily think of pipes and pumps. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=87.62s)]
*  What is happening in here? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=92.26s)]
*  So supercomputers burn tens of megawatts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=93.7s)]
*  And so that turns into heat that you have to somehow remove. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=98.86s)]
*  And so the setup we have here is we take water from the lake, and this is the big pipe coming [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=103.48s)]
*  in. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=109.78s)]
*  And then this water goes into a heat exchanger where the water stays in the center. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=111.04s)]
*  The center typically cools around 10 to 15 megawatts, but has the capacity to go up to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=120.04s)]
*  25. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=125.84s)]
*  Water from Lake Lugano is drawn in where it's typically seven degrees Celsius. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Once used to cool the vast array of technical infrastructure, it goes back to the lake around [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=133.4s)]
*  15 to 20 degrees Celsius. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=138.68s)]
*  The inherent problems that we have is we need water for cooling and we need electricity [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=142.0s)]
*  to power the machines. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  The two don't go well if something happens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Fabiously they don't mix. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  And this is why we are on the raised floor. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  And so should something happen, some pipe breaks or so and water comes out, it will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=154.94s)]
*  be collected here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=161.9s)]
*  And then this is really separated into different sectors so that water damage over here doesn't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=163.78s)]
*  move on the other side. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=170.98s)]
*  One level above, the pipes may be smaller, but water is still very much at the heart [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=174.14s)]
*  of the supercomputer center. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  Each of the 2,688 blades has a blue and red pipe, color-coded to avoid confusion during [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=181.5s)]
*  planned maintenance. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  So this is the inside of one of these blades, one of these many blades in this system. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  What are we looking at here? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  So here you have a grace and a hopper processor, so a multi-core CPU and a GPU, H100 GPU. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=199.02s)]
*  And they are of course consuming a lot of power, so that's why the liquid cooling goes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=208.78s)]
*  directly on the processor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  So that's what these pipes here are? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=216.18s)]
*  Copper pipes here, where the cold water comes in here, is distributed and then comes in, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=219.26s)]
*  and the warm water goes out back into the data center. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=227.18s)]
*  By crunching vast amounts of environmental data, ALPS helps forecast sea level rise, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=233.74s)]
*  glacial retreat and extreme weather events on a global scale. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=239.9s)]
*  AI is basically, you're building a predictive model based on data. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=244.86s)]
*  So you could, for example, increase computationally the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=251.06s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=256.74s)]
*  What you can now do with those simulations is you can take your little understanding [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  of reflective properties, but you can now scale it up to the whole planet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=261.26s)]
*  So these are all things that are not easy to understand, but you can run it in massive [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  simulations like on this machine. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=270.14s)]
*  Not far from ALPS is the Contra dam. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=272.58s)]
*  It's the fourth tallest dam in Switzerland, standing at 220 meters high. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=275.38s)]
*  At its source, the Wernsasker River, which is heavily influenced by rain and snowfall [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=281.94s)]
*  in the surrounding mountainous region. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=286.74s)]
*  This valley is famous for its extreme precipitation events. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=290.26s)]
*  So it holds some of the world records of precipitation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=294.98s)]
*  And what we are doing, we are using the supercomputer apps in Switzerland and run global climate [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=299.38s)]
*  simulations. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  One of the models aims to predict the impacts of rising CO2 levels on the planet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=308.18s)]
*  They do this by performing a series of tests replicated on a worldwide scale to see how [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=313.7s)]
*  the atmosphere reacts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=319.82s)]
*  If you sort of think of the Earth, we have millions of grid points or locations where [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=321.74s)]
*  we actually sample the environmental conditions like temperature, wind and so on. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=327.38s)]
*  And then we have to go up in altitude, 150 levels. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=332.76s)]
*  And then we have millions, millions of computations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=337.34s)]
*  It's basically impossible to run on a normal computer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  In a world facing both data overload and environmental crisis, ALPS is a chance for technology and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=346.7s)]
*  nature to work together. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=353.94s)]
*  Setting a standard for how supercomputers stay cool without heating the planet. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVRAK8KIBg&t=356.46s)]
