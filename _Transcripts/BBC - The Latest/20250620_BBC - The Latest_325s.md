*  Fighting against tourism on Spain's streets is back and the holiday industry is starting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=54.36s)]
*  to worry. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=59.56s)]
*  Spanish people love tourism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=60.56s)]
*  How tourism impacts the people who live where we visit is key. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=64.36s)]
*  The main problem of Majorca right now is not the tourism, it's the consequences. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=69.24s)]
*  And housing is at its core. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=74.6s)]
*  The issues of over-tourism are so pertinent here in Parma. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=77.68s)]
*  I've just been walking through the streets and chanced upon this protest. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=80.72s)]
*  This tent represents the main problem we have here in the Balearic Islands, especially in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=84.12s)]
*  Parma. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=89.76s)]
*  We have a lot of problems to afford rent. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=90.76s)]
*  If you have to pay this in rent, it's more than your salary. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=94.92s)]
*  It's impossible to us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=98.88s)]
*  A hot issue for the local press. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=100.88s)]
*  How the surge in visitors and a boom in Airbnbs and illegal holiday apartments is making it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  hard for locals to find somewhere to live. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  Through the busy streets to the government building. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Hi, good to see you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=116.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=117.04s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=118.04s)]
*  So tell me where we are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=119.04s)]
*  We're just like in front of the parliament. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=120.04s)]
*  Ferran is an environment minister in the Balearic government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Mass tourism is key to his brief. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=125.16s)]
*  It's about the feeling of being an outsider in your own place, in the sense that the city [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=127.64s)]
*  has no longer services for locals. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=133.6s)]
*  Do you feel that there are simply just too many flights arriving here in Mallorca and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=136.72s)]
*  in the rest of Spain? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=141.2s)]
*  They're growing here because they want to operate at higher capacity in summer, which [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=142.2s)]
*  is completely...we kind of cope with that many people on the island. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  This is Sinu, a small town right in the heart of Mallorca, far from the popular coastal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  resorts, but there's still tourism here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=157.16s)]
*  There's plenty of holiday lets and also a growing number of hotels. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm now going to show you the breakfast room. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Last year, Jose's hotel was graffitied by protesters. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=166.6s)]
*  He sympathises with their cause. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=169.68s)]
*  Mass tourism is putting huge pressure on the island's resources, like power and water. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=171.96s)]
*  Are you going to make another desalted plant? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=177.12s)]
*  Are you going to make another highway because this highway is getting too small? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=182.08s)]
*  Okay, you're going to solve the problem in maybe a few years, but in five years time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=186.76s)]
*  you will have to make another highway and two other hospitals. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=191.88s)]
*  It's no surprise that Spain is the UK's favourite holiday destination. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=196.24s)]
*  Just look at it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=200.44000000000003s)]
*  And here in Parmen over in Mallorca, the restaurant owners and bars are keen to make sure that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  Brits know that it's still open for tourism, regardless of those protests. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  Resorts like this, filled with bars, restaurants and shops, were built for our holidays. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Spain's economy has done very well from them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=217.52s)]
*  Very few protests happen here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  Of course I would tell them, don't be afraid. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=222.52s)]
*  We come to us, we thrive off of avenues, we need the British tourism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=225.36s)]
*  Everyone's still welcome. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=229.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course, of course everybody's still welcome. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=230.96s)]
*  We want you here, we want to give you the best holiday experience. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, don't be afraid of what you see in the newspaper, not everything is what it seems. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=236.12s)]
*  Ambassador, tell me about how busy that flight route is between the UK and Spain. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=242.52s)]
*  Well Simon, it's the highest air connectivity in the world. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=247.36s)]
*  Spain anticipates 100 million visitors this year, a record. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=252.6s)]
*  Its ambassador to the UK is keen to stress protests are small and do not represent the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  view of the Spanish people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=263.08s)]
*  What does the Spanish government want to say to those people that were squirted with water [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=264.84s)]
*  pistols in cafes on Sunday, who've paid to come to Spain to eat your food, drink your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=269.32s)]
*  coffee, drink your beer, enjoy the sights and then met with being sprayed with water [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=277.28s)]
*  pistols? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  All I can say is that we are awfully sorry and that it doesn't represent at all the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  feeling in Spain. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  You know how well tourists are treated in Spain in general and British people particularly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  The atmosphere in Spain is not hostile at all. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  On the contrary, it's as friendly as ever. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=298.28s)]
*  And we are working hard as you know now, not on making numbers grow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=301.52s)]
*  We don't want numbers to grow. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  We want satisfaction to grow in Spain. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=307.08s)]
*  The Spanish government has begun tighter regulation of holiday flats. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=312.0s)]
*  The tourist industry is bitter about the damage rentals have done. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=315.8s)]
*  A long hot summer is ahead. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FpGRCVxKio&t=320.08s)]
