Video Description: Increasing numbers of young people are using Ketamine and the health impacts can be catastrophic.
 
Although highly dangerous, ket, also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high.
 
Just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. 
 
But some experts are sceptical as to whether this would make much of a difference.

# What does Ketamine do to your brain, body and bladder? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI)
*  Why is our generation so addicted to ket? Ketamine addiction has more than doubled in England and Wales since 2016 and it's tripled for under 25s. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been looking into this rise in usage and talking to experts across the BBC to see what's behind it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  So you've heard it before but ketamine is actually a horse tranquiliser. One gram is enough to knock out a horse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=12.24s)]
*  It's also used on pets, wildlife and zoo animals as well but since the 70s it's been used as an anaesthetic on humans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=17.44s)]
*  It can make you hallucinate and dissociate and more recently it's been used for people with severe mental illnesses [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=24.16s)]
*  but only if they haven't responded to other forms of treatment. But psychiatrists do say there's more research needed on how effective it is in clinical settings. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=29.52s)]
*  But when ket is misused it can really really affect your bladder among lots of other things. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=36.72s)]
*  Actually about one in four people who use ket will have bladder problems as a result and some addicts completely lose control of their bladder because of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=41.28s)]
*  As in they literally wet themselves. So Rachel who I used to work with did this whole documentary about ket for the BBC. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=48.0s)]
*  She met dealers and people who were struggling with addiction and she said some of them had this problem. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=54.0s)]
*  One of the people I met with ketamine addiction talked about how she couldn't walk 50 metres without needing to sit down because she was in so much pain or she would need to go to the toilet. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=58.96s)]
*  Because the other thing is that ketamine reduces the lining of your bladder which can then shrink it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=70.88s)]
*  So a normal bladder might be able to hold say 500 millilitres of urine and a ketamine bladder at its worst might only be able to hold like 20 or 30 millimetres. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=76.8s)]
*  So it can have massive effect on being able to go to the toilet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=86.96s)]
*  You might have heard of K-cramps. They're another side effect. Really really bad stomach pains that can happen if you use ket repeatedly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=90.16s)]
*  It's been compared to childbirth pain. It's really horrible. I remember the first time I had it I went to hospital because I had no idea what this pain was. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=96.08s)]
*  But Rachel was telling me how a lot of people end up in this catch-22 sort of situation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  If you're experiencing those cramps and the pains and some of the physical effects then actually the only thing that really helps with it is to take more ketamine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=109.36s)]
*  And although it's not physically addictive that is where the addiction comes in because it does help ease those cramps and ease those pains. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=118.48s)]
*  So to properly understand how much drugs people are using researchers actually test sewage water to get around the fact that people might lie or not even know what they're taking if they were surveyed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=125.84s)]
*  So who takes the most ket in Europe? The highest loads of K were found in wastewater in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary and Norway. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  So that study didn't cover the UK but a separate one estimated that ketamine consumption in the UK was up by 85%. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=142.88s)]
*  As we said earlier ketamine has been used to treat mental health conditions and a lot of addicts started it with that in mind. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=149.84s)]
*  A lot of people start taking it maybe when they're partying but then what tends to happen is because of that dissociative effect. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  People might start taking it to help with their mental health as well and certainly of all the people I spoke to who were struggling with ketamine addiction they all were taking it to help with their mental health or deal with something that had happened in their life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=162.96s)]
*  So how does ketamine work then? It's about to get scientific but bear with me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=178.0s)]
*  So ketamine doesn't just target one system in your brain it targets dozens. It's thought it impacts a neurotransmitter called glutamate. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=181.44s)]
*  Neurons use glutamate to communicate with each other so without it your brain would just shut down. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=188.72s)]
*  At high doses ket blocks glutamate meaning your neurons stop communicating hence why it's a powerful anesthetic and why if you take too much you might enter a K-hole and not be able to move. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=193.76s)]
*  At low doses like the amount you might take for recreational use it actually ramps up production of glutamate which is where the side effects or high comes in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Hallucinations, detachment from reality. Low doses can also form new connections between neurons connections that might have previously been lost through stress or depression. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=213.68s)]
*  There's still a lot we don't know about this effect since it impacts so many brain receptors it can be quite hard to track them all. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=223.36s)]
*  So just to be clear ketamine is not a licensed treatment for depression in the UK. It's not available on the NHS and the effects of taking it long term are unknown. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=228.8s)]
*  So back to the key question why is it so popular and how dangerous actually is it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  So we know huge amounts of ketamine have been coming into the UK recently it's increased at least 10 times what it was a decade ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=241.36s)]
*  That's because big testing labs have popped up in parts of Asia and these organised crime groups are finding different ways to transport it around the world easily until it makes its way to the dealers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=247.44s)]
*  They're able to get a hold of it so easily they can sell it at a really cheap price which is why or part of the reason why it's a lot cheaper than some other drugs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  And it is cheap a bag of ket can cost as little as 15 pounds and while alcohol is getting more and more expensive with inflation and minimum prices it does make sense that people might be looking for a night out alternative. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=265.36s)]
*  But what do we know about the dangers? The Vivian from Drag Race UK recently died aged 32 and their family announced it was caused by a cardiac arrest after using ket. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  So deaths are rare and less common than with other drugs like cocaine but the rates of death from ket are increasing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=285.2s)]
*  From 2018 to 2022 the number of deaths went from a low of 21 in 2019 to an all-time high of 37 in 2022. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=292.08s)]
*  So because you don't feel pain properly when you've taken ket you can sometimes injure yourself and not know it and we also know that mixing it with other substances is really dangerous. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=300.64s)]
*  Because of this some people think the drug should be considered more harmful than it is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=309.28s)]
*  UK governments currently get advice on reclassifying ket. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=313.12s)]
*  All drugs are put in three categories, Class A, B and C. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=316.24s)]
*  A is the most dangerous, that's things like cocaine, MDMA, LSD and mushrooms. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=319.36s)]
*  Ket is a Class B at the moment, that's the same as cannabis and codeine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  And then C is the lowest class, that's stuff like nos and diazepam. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  Some people want ket pushed up from Class B to A to put people off trying it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  Now what some people say is that if it was a Class A drug and there was a more serious penalty for dealing it, it might actually put some dealers off. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  But others say reclassifying it might put addicts off from getting help in case they were worried about getting in trouble. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=343.84s)]
*  Recently one thing we've seen is people sharing their recovery journeys on TikTok. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=348.64s)]
*  Videos like this are getting loads of views, sharing support, milestones and giving hope to other people that are struggling. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=352.96s)]
*  Obviously a lot of the terms related to ket are blocked on TikTok but hashtags like addiction and recovery have millions of views. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  So how do you get professional help? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=364.88s)]
*  Going to your GP is obviously always a good place to start but it's not always that simple. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=366.88s)]
*  What I found from some of the people I spoke to was that they would go to their GP and of course because they're not experts in ketamine and ketamine addiction, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=371.28s)]
*  they don't necessarily know what the symptoms are and they don't necessarily know the best support to point people in the direction of. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=380.32s)]
*  So actually what I would say is go to drug charities, drug support groups, get information from them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  Mental health organisations as well can really help if you're struggling with the psychological impact of ketamine [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  and if you're experiencing really serious bladder problems as a result of ketamine addiction then it's worth trying to see your urologist as well. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=404.32s)]
*  So since it's widely available, relatively cheap and because of its dissociative effects, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=413.76s)]
*  ket seems to have moved from being a night out drug and anaesthetic to being used more commonly at home. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  But a lot is still unknown and its misuse can have massive effects on your physical and mental health. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you think we missed anything here? Let us know in the comments if you do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=428.8s)]
*  And also details of information and support with addiction are available at bbc.co.uk forward slash action line. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7hV56wLdI&t=431.76s)]
