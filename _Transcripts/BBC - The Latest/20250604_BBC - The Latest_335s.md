*  But now let's turn to the ongoing war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=0.0s)]
*  Traffic's resumed on the Kerch Bridge. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=2.68s)]
*  This links Russia and the occupied Crimean peninsula [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=5.0s)]
*  after Ukraine said it had sabotaged that crossing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=8.68s)]
*  There was a massive underwater explosion [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=11.72s)]
*  that Ukraine says it has been planning for months [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=13.44s)]
*  by placing explosives under the bridge [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to try to damage its foundations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=18.2s)]
*  Well, the Kerch Bridge was opened by President Putin in 2018 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=20.46s)]
*  after his annexation of Crimea four years earlier in 2014. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's talk to Kira Rudik, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=30.12s)]
*  a Ukrainian MP, leader of the Golos party. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=31.8s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=35.32s)]
*  We're seeing, of course, the Russia saying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=36.88s)]
*  that that bridge linking Crimea has reopened, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=39.96s)]
*  but just talking about what Ukraine did [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=43.32s)]
*  in order to get explosives underwater, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=45.92s)]
*  it seems that Ukraine is being increasingly audacious [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=48.28s)]
*  in the attacks that you are planning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=52.2s)]
*  And of course, I'm thinking about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=53.96s)]
*  the extraordinary attacks on air bases [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=55.16s)]
*  deep inside Russia, hundreds of drones being used, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=58.8s)]
*  smuggled in, an operation that took, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=62.48s)]
*  Spider's Web took a year or so in the planning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=64.36s)]
*  This is Ukraine really, really targeting Russia [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  and very, very hard and very cleverly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Hello, Kashin, thank you so much [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=73.62s)]
*  for having me here in the studio. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=74.9s)]
*  Of course, we are excited about this operation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=76.96s)]
*  and it is opening like a new page [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  in the military operations that special forces can conduct. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=82.32s)]
*  For us, it's very important that right now, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=87.72s)]
*  Russia will have less opportunities [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=90.0s)]
*  and less means to attack us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=91.8s)]
*  Because every time Russian plane is going up, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=93.82s)]
*  holding the missiles, in Ukraine, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=97.6s)]
*  basically everything stops. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=99.52s)]
*  Kids go downstairs to the bomb shelters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  in the Kira Rudik-Gartner schools. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=104.06s)]
*  People stop working and have to go to the bomb shelters, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=106.35999999999999s)]
*  banks, stop everything. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  And we are just sitting and waiting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  if they will decide to start killing us or not. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  And right now, there will be less of that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=115.0s)]
*  And this is why we feel so much of the relief [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=117.92s)]
*  that there would be less air raids going on, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=121.12s)]
*  there would be less terrorist attacks by Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we are so happy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=128.12s)]
*  that the world applauds to this special operation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=130.24s)]
*  It shows additional fact that the only way [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=133.12s)]
*  how you can work with Russia is the language of force, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=136.56s)]
*  the language of strength. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  For the last three years, we haven't seen talks [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=141.8s)]
*  bringing us anywhere close to the end of the war, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=144.78s)]
*  but we have seen our special operations [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=147.98s)]
*  actually forcing Russia to stop doing what they are doing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=151.1s)]
*  But does it stop them? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=153.9s)]
*  Because after Spider's Web operation, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=155.02s)]
*  after that, just like I say, extraordinary operation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=156.66s)]
*  where hundreds of Ukrainian drones [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=159.18s)]
*  deep inside Russia's bases, as far away as Siberia, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=161.58s)]
*  which is around 5,000 kilometers away from Kiev, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=165.62s)]
*  extraordinary planning. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=168.66s)]
*  But following that, there were repercussions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=169.66s)]
*  and targeted drone attacks by Russia across Kiev [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=172.28s)]
*  and lots of places across Ukraine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=175.8s)]
*  They're retaliating every time you do such a targeted attack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=177.24s)]
*  I would ask you, does it really mean for you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=180.8s)]
*  that your city is attacked as a retaliation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=183.52s)]
*  or just a simple ordinary terrorist attack? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=186.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=189.26s)]
*  And for us, Russia has been attacking us [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=190.4s)]
*  with no reasons, no means. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=192.6s)]
*  So I think it's probably not correct [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=194.6s)]
*  to call any attack as a retaliation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=197.6s)]
*  They have started a full-scale invasion three years ago, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=200.44s)]
*  and they continue attacking us no matter what we do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=203.72s)]
*  And so our goal is just to decrease or destroy [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=207.0s)]
*  the amount of means they have for these attacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=210.28s)]
*  And this is, again, to the point of President Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=213.04s)]
*  and everybody else who say you can negotiate with Russia. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=215.56s)]
*  Well, the truth is you may, but the result, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=218.6s)]
*  you can only show at the battlefield. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=221.92s)]
*  It's not that diplomacy influences battlefield. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=224.0s)]
*  It's vice versa. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=226.52s)]
*  When we are stronger at the battlefield, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  then the diplomacy has a chance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=229.4s)]
*  Well, you've got diplomacy taking place tomorrow, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=231.24s)]
*  the Remstein meeting, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=233.6s)]
*  and that's the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  at the NATO HQ in Brussels. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=237.52s)]
*  You do need to keep talking. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=240.16s)]
*  What do you hope to get out of that meeting, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=242.1s)]
*  and are they listening to you? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=244.4s)]
*  So our requirements, requests didn't actually change. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=246.24s)]
*  We need more weapons, and we need more air defense systems [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=250.44s)]
*  to protect our people from the attacks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=253.76s)]
*  because this is our key and core responsibility [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=256.36s)]
*  and key requirement. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=260.2s)]
*  However, there will be a question of how to pay [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=262.28s)]
*  for those air defense systems, how to pay for those weapons. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=264.48s)]
*  And this is why we are working in parallel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=267.52s)]
*  on the track of the confiscation of the Russian assets [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=269.6s)]
*  and using them for the sake of Ukraine, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=272.48s)]
*  because this is so unfair that people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=274.52s)]
*  of the democratic countries get to pay out of their taxes [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=276.88s)]
*  for supporting Ukraine when there are 300 billion euros [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=280.52s)]
*  that are laying down in Belgium, in Euroclear, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=284.72s)]
*  and they are there, and we need to go politically [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=288.96s)]
*  and confiscate them and use this amount of money [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=292.96s)]
*  for the sake of Ukraine. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=296.16s)]
*  Right now, this amount is bigger than the total amount of aid [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=297.64s)]
*  that Ukraine has received from all of our allies. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  So we are asking not for something surreal, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=305.36s)]
*  and again, talking about surreal [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=308.48s)]
*  after the special forces attack, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=310.2s)]
*  but we are asking for really political will [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=312.84s)]
*  to go ahead and do the right thing, just think, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=315.64s)]
*  think that will hurt Russia really bad on the economic front, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=318.08s)]
*  confiscate Russian money. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  And I know that that is gonna be brought up [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=324.88s)]
*  at the Ramshin meeting tomorrow. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=326.52s)]
*  Kira Rudik, Ukrainian MP, leader of the Golos party, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  thank you very much for joining us here live on BBC News. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  Really appreciate it, thank you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ouddrLPZZU&t=334.52s)]
