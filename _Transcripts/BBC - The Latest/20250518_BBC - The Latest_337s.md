# Will Bluesky be able to rival X or Twitter? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0)
*  The world of social media is often like a soap opera. Love stories and rivalries, last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=0.0s)]
*  minute script changes and sudden deaths. One network trying to reset the system is Blue [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=9.58s)]
*  Sky. Spun out of Twitter, now known as X, it's been enjoying a recent surge in users [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=15.34s)]
*  thanks to the US presidential election. Last November, whilst X lost over 100,000 users [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=20.8s)]
*  overnight, growth at Blue Sky reportedly skyrocketed with a 500% increase in daily usage. I sat [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=26.88s)]
*  down with the boss to find out more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=33.96s)]
*  I think a lot of people are just ready for something different. Even if they were dissatisfied, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=37.04s)]
*  they were hesitant to move up until they realised all at once, okay, like maybe this is a moment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=41.36s)]
*  where everybody else is all deciding at the same time that we're done with this. And [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=47.16s)]
*  so that's why a lot of people start moving at once. Like once it starts trending, it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=51.32s)]
*  gets this momentum, sort of like a snowball rolling down a mountain. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  Blue Sky is uniquely decentralised, meaning members can host their data on servers other [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=59.72s)]
*  than those owned by the company. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=65.12s)]
*  The core philosophy behind Blue Sky is that no single person should control all the speech [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  on a social network. At the end of the day, you can't rely on one person, even me. Like, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=73.16s)]
*  we don't want you to have to trust me. That's the goal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=77.92s)]
*  Now I've heard you say that Blue Sky is billionaire proof. What do you mean by that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=80.64s)]
*  The structure of society reflects the form of its communication. And so if you have [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=84.76s)]
*  a communications platform where everyone is getting their news, this is how they make [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  sense of the world, and it's just controlled by one person, then you're going to see that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=94.28s)]
*  affect society at a large scale. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=98.68s)]
*  A lot of social networks have leaders that imagine themselves as monarchs of this new [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  empire. You know, I am the Caesar of this new empire that controls the speech of billions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  of people, and that's not the world we want to live in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=111.6s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg is one of the leaders Jay is referring to, who wore a t-shirt last year [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  with the Latin phrase, out zook out naheel, translating to zook or nothing, a play on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  the phrase Caesar or nothing. In response at South by Southwest in Texas, Jay wore a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=125.64s)]
*  very similar shirt which read, a world without Caesars. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  I made this joke a few months ago in Slack, and then the team ran with it, and they found [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=135.44s)]
*  somebody to make the shirt, and I decided to wear it. It was a good joke. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=140.28s)]
*  What are your feelings towards him? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=144.68s)]
*  I mean, I have nothing personal against him. I think that he's run a company really efficiently, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=146.84s)]
*  but I think that the whole paradigm of, you know, I am a global monarch of a large social [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=153.08s)]
*  media empire is outdated and wrong. It's not the right way forward. I think that the right [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=159.4s)]
*  way forward is the open principles of the early web and social networks that give users [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=165.94000000000003s)]
*  more control. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=171.58s)]
*  Blue Sky is intended to be highly customisable. Its algorithms and content moderation can [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  be dictated by users themselves. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=178.78s)]
*  People really want less toxic social experiences, and that means having a good moderator, and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  we don't necessarily think that we're always going to be the ones to get it right, which [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=188.46s)]
*  is why we have an open ecosystem where if you think that we're getting it wrong, you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=192.32s)]
*  can build your own version. But every social space needs to run according to some rules, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=196.4s)]
*  and so that's why we have foundational moderation policies which say these are the terms of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=200.96s)]
*  sort of the sandbox that you can build on top of. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=206.16s)]
*  But as you continue to grow, how are you going to be across everything? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=208.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a hard problem. Moderation always is, but it's important, and people feeling [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=211.68s)]
*  safe online is important, and so we've invested in it and continue to invest in it. We also [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=217.28s)]
*  use some automation, but I don't think you can ever replace the role of human judgement, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=222.88s)]
*  and so there's a human in the loop. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=228.76s)]
*  With only 21 staff, but 34 million users, the company is looking at different ways to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=230.8s)]
*  keep the lights on, including subscription fees. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=236.4s)]
*  The way advertising is played out with social is a bit like when a country discovers oil [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=239.44s)]
*  and then that's all that they go in on because it's so lucrative and it sort of turns the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=244.36s)]
*  entire company into an ad engine. The whole timeline is just about serving you ads, so [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=249.08s)]
*  we don't want to go down that path. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=254.2s)]
*  Will you consider running advertising in the future? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that when ads work their way in, they might even come from some other corner of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=259.08s)]
*  the network because we don't control every app out there, we don't control every timeline [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=264.08s)]
*  out there, and we'll see how it plays out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=267.78s)]
*  How personal is this work to you? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=270.6s)]
*  Very important, very personal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, I started off my career as a digital policy activist. I saw that companies like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=278.76000000000005s)]
*  Facebook were accumulating a lot of power and over the long run, this kind of control [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  is not good for society. When I got into tech, I wrote down on a note card for myself, my [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  mission was to expand empowerment to tech. I want to build technology that gives people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  more control over their lives online because I think that technology affects the way that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=300.24s)]
*  society evolves. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=305.48s)]
*  Whilst Blue Sky's collective heart may be in the right place now, we'll have to wait [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=307.72s)]
*  and see what the future holds for this blue butterfly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYhNM-tGX0&t=312.28000000000003s)]
