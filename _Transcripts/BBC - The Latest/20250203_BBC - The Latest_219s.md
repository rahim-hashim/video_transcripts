Video Description: The former president of Spain's football federation, Luis Rubiales, goes on trial on Monday, accused of sexual assault for kissing the player Jenni Hermoso at the 2023 World Cup.
 
Hermoso is scheduled to appear as a witness on the opening day having travelled from Mexico, where she plays club football. The trial runs until 19 February.
 
As Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win the 2023 World Cup, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips.
 
Afterwards, Hermoso said the kiss had not been consensual, while Rubiales insisted it had been.
 
After initially remaining defiant and denouncing a witch-hunt driven by "fake feminism", the federation president eventually resigned, before legal charges were brought against him.

# Spainâ€™s former football boss Luis Rubiales goes on trial over World Cup kiss | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug)
*  The former president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, goes on trial today, accused of sexual assault. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr Rubiales sparked controversy when he kissed a member of the national women's team on the mouth after they won the World Cup in 2023. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=9.0s)]
*  And that trial has just got underway in the last few moments. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=17.0s)]
*  There is the camera showing proceedings getting underway live in Madrid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=21.0s)]
*  The proceedings are in Spanish, but we will in a moment be speaking to our colleague Guy Hedgeco, who is at the court. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=27.0s)]
*  But first, let's have a look at the background to this case and hear from a report from Guy Hedgeco. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=35.0s)]
*  The Spanish team lifts the 2023 World Cup after beating England in the final. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=41.0s)]
*  But victory was soon overshadowed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=47.0s)]
*  Luis Rubiales hugged each player in celebration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=50.0s)]
*  But when it came to striker Yeni Hermoso, after this hug he kissed her on the mouth. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=54.0s)]
*  He said the kiss was consensual. She said it was not. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=59.0s)]
*  Having been forced out of the federation by the ensuing backlash, Mr Rubiales now faces a possible jail sentence if found guilty of sexual assault. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=66.0s)]
*  He also faces a charge of coercion for allegedly trying to force Ms Hermoso to say that she didn't object to the kiss. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=77.0s)]
*  Three of his former colleagues are also on trial for coercion, including the coach of the World Cup winning team, Jorge Vilda. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=85.0s)]
*  All four men deny any wrongdoing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=93.0s)]
*  It's been a difficult journey for Spanish women's football. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=99.0s)]
*  Isabel Fuentes started playing for the national team in 1971 when there was a dictatorship and little institutional support for female football. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=103.0s)]
*  Just talking about the recent World Cup victory brings tears to her eyes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=112.0s)]
*  It was something we would have liked to experience, she says. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=120.0s)]
*  But we weren't allowed to. These players won it for us. They have lived out our dreams. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=123.0s)]
*  For current players such as those at third division club Olympia Las Rozas, the game has changed for the better. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=133.0s)]
*  When I was younger, girls playing football was kind of strange. You were told, oh, that's for boys or that's not a girl's thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=141.0s)]
*  But I think now being a girl playing football, it's something cool. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=150.0s)]
*  And attractive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=155.0s)]
*  And attractive, yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=156.0s)]
*  But the Rubiales case has underlined what some see as continued sexist attitudes within the sport. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=158.0s)]
*  Luis Rubiales believes this is a case of the law going too far. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=166.0s)]
*  For Yenny Hermoso, it will be a chance to ensure that Spanish football and society change for the better. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=171.0s)]
*  Guy Hedgeco, BBC News, Madrid. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, we will be hearing from Guy Hedgeco in about 10 minutes or so from now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=181.0s)]
*  But we can take you back to the courtroom there just to let you know that that trial is now underway. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=187.0s)]
*  It got underway in Madrid in the last five minutes or so. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=195.0s)]
*  And you can see there lawyers from both sides there setting out the initial arguments in that trial. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=200.0s)]
*  So, of course, we will be at the court to speak to Guy Hedgeco in the next 10 or 15 minutes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IF9kcOeiug&t=209.0s)]
