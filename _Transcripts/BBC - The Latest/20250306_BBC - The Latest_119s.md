Video Description: Some of the sweeping tariffs imposed on Mexican and Canadian goods imported to the United States will be suspended until next month, US President Donald Trump said.
 
The US previously enacted sweeping 25% tariffs on its North American neighbours earlier this week.
 
Trump said he wants to use tariffs to protect US jobs and manufacturing, and to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA)
*  It's his second climb down in as many days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the imposition of trade tariffs, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=2.44s)]
*  first, Donald Trump rode back in relation to Mexico. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=4.44s)]
*  And in the last couple of hours, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=8.16s)]
*  Canada has also won a reprieve on goods covered [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=9.36s)]
*  in a trade agreement with the US. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=12.36s)]
*  Mr. Trump says the recent dramatic falls [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=14.44s)]
*  in financial markets, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=17.16s)]
*  crashing to their lowest level since November last year, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=18.28s)]
*  has nothing to do with his change of heart. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=21.44s)]
*  Well, Dashimi David is here with me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  The bottom line is the markets don't like trade wars. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=26.36s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  They do not, Clive. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=29.96s)]
*  And one of President Trump's moves in his first term [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=31.32s)]
*  was to put tariffs or trade taxes on imports [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=34.4s)]
*  on washing machines coming into his country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=38.8s)]
*  This time, just a few weeks in, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  and his twists and turns in trade policy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=42.52s)]
*  have got the whole world trapped in a spin cycle, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=44.36s)]
*  including those markets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And he may say he's not watching them, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=49.28s)]
*  but many commentators say those stock markets [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=51.28s)]
*  are acting as a brake on his ambitions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=54.16s)]
*  Just take a look at what happened today, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=56.92s)]
*  those kind of smiles at the closing bell [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=59.92s)]
*  on the trading floor there you can see, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=62.28s)]
*  and the cheers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=64.04s)]
*  The S&P 500, that key measure, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=65.08s)]
*  finished below where it was just ahead of the US election. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=67.68s)]
*  Investors are fearful that President Trump's policies [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=71.6s)]
*  will achieve the opposite of creating the jobs and growth [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  that he hopes for. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=78.16s)]
*  And that real world evidence is mounting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=79.32s)]
*  The trade deficit has been widening [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=81.6s)]
*  as Americans buy in more imports to try and beat those tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=83.92s)]
*  And that means more money going out of America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=87.84s)]
*  Some commentators are warning that President Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=90.72s)]
*  is not just weaponizing trade, but uncertainty, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  and that could backfire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=96.4s)]
*  Business confidence, consumer confidence, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  both falling in America. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  There's mutterings on Wall Street [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=102.04s)]
*  that far from making America great again, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=103.76s)]
*  we may see the risk rising of a Trump session. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=106.28s)]
*  And don't forget, any downturn there risks some fallout here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=110.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=114.68s)]
*  All right, Darshini, thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRTjs_OjcA&t=115.52000000000001s)]
