Video Description: A group of academics and activists are questioning the possibility of endless economic growth on a finite planet and are advocating a bold solution: degrowth. 
Originating in France, the degrowth movement has spread to places like Japan, the UK and Barcelona, taking root in academia, grassroots organisations and among university students. 
The movement argues for a 'democratisation of the economy' and for collectively managing key resources, like housing. 
Critics argue that opposing economic growth is impractical and warn of negative consequences, especially for the most vulnerable. 
We take a look at the theory - and ask what the practice might look like.

# Could 'degrowth' save the world? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8)
*  So essentially it's how do we live well on this planet without destroying it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a simple question. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=7.76s)]
*  We are saturated, you know, with all this information and of talking of the problem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=9.86s)]
*  How can we have spaces to look towards the solution? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=13.88s)]
*  We've all heard it before. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  To create a sustainable world, we must move away from fossil fuels and embrace green technology. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=18.76s)]
*  But what if technology alone isn't enough? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=25.14s)]
*  People are dying and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=28.12s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=36.0s)]
*  What is solving the issues of climate change demands a more profound systemic change. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=38.08s)]
*  The group of activists and academics argue that infinite economic growth on our finite [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=43.28s)]
*  planet is a dangerous solution. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Their bold solution? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=50.8s)]
*  Degrowth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=52.36s)]
*  We are trying to teach people the importance of building social, economic and environmental [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=53.36s)]
*  links with people around you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=59.24s)]
*  So moving to this project gave me a lot of stability. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=60.8s)]
*  I know that I'm going to have here 40 people that will be there for me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=64.68s)]
*  It takes two kinds of work. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=68.2s)]
*  It takes social, political, organization work, but also it takes a cultural shift. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=69.52s)]
*  Is it time to embrace more radical solutions or are we risking too much? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  All of our experience historically has been that if the economy shrinks for a period of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=80.08s)]
*  time that results in big increases in poverty. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=84.56s)]
*  I think degrowth underestimates the power of innovation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=88.52s)]
*  Degrowth underestimates the need for investment and degrowth underestimates the social feasibility [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  of what they propose. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=100.6s)]
*  There's no necessary contradiction between social and ecological objectives, but it does [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=101.6s)]
*  require a pretty radical transformation of the way we think about the economy and structure it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=107.02s)]
*  In 1972 a group of researchers published a book titled The Limits to Growth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=122.9s)]
*  The first conclusion was the following. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=128.62s)]
*  If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=131.14s)]
*  and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=137.1s)]
*  reached sometime within the next 100 years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  The book sparked a heated debate at the time, but also inspired a generation of scholars [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=146.34s)]
*  who started questioning the benefits of an ever-expanding economy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=151.1s)]
*  Professor Joan Martinez-Saliere is considered one of the godfathers of degrowth and the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=156.22s)]
*  founder of the Barcelona School of Ecological Economics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=160.46s)]
*  He began writing about the links between the economy and the environment in the 80s. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  Economic theory was based just on prices and markets and not on the real substance of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=168.9s)]
*  economy, which is the material flows and the energy flows. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  So my book was doing a kind of history of these critiques of the economy and it was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  the first book with the title Ecological Economics because degrowth comes partly from ecological [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=189.62s)]
*  economics. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=196.78s)]
*  Then in 2008, the hated idea of having in France a meeting in English about degrowth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=200.26s)]
*  The degrowth movement, which began in France as Des Croissants and was inspired by thinkers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=211.14s)]
*  like Serge Lattouche, is now spreading worldwide, becoming popular in countries like Japan, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=216.62s)]
*  the UK and Spain. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=222.54s)]
*  In Barcelona it is being embraced by academics, grassroots movements and activists. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=224.38s)]
*  Degrowth is a radical proposal to pull the emergency brake on a train that is going to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=229.9s)]
*  the precipice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=236.3s)]
*  So it's a call to stop this pursuit of endless compound geometric growth for growth's sake. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=237.3s)]
*  It isn't like a call to destroy the economy, it's not a call for permanent recession. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=243.86s)]
*  It's a call for doing things differently and in a way that human needs come first, human [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=249.46s)]
*  and ecosystem needs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=254.34s)]
*  Welcome to La Brugada de Pueblo. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  This is our guesthouse and environmental teaching space. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=264.82s)]
*  Here we have a guesthouse business, we have a retreat centre, we have our own family home, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=270.26s)]
*  we have a field there where we're doing regenerative agricultural experiments and we have all of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=275.46s)]
*  this forest where people come to reconnect with nature. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=281.1s)]
*  So we're really transparent about how we run this place on the principles of degrowth [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=288.1s)]
*  and the principles of permaculture. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=292.22s)]
*  We like to convey the idea that an abundant life doesn't necessarily have to be one that's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  full of consumerism and loads of stuff. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=302.38s)]
*  So it does demand a lifestyle change but it in theory shouldn't be one that bothers many [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=305.38s)]
*  people but it's getting people out of what is basically a trap. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  And one of the main traps we are in now, degrowth has argued, is actually the very way we measure [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  our economies using GDP or gross domestic product. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=320.54s)]
*  Yeah, GDP is interesting. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=324.74s)]
*  It's a really bad measure of an economy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=325.74s)]
*  It counts the market value of everything that we produce but it does not count the social [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=329.26s)]
*  and ecological costs of production. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=333.34s)]
*  Because right now the idea is effectively, let's just chase GDP growth, ever increasing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=342.34s)]
*  levels of production and hope that this magically solves our social and ecological crises, which [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=347.06s)]
*  it never does. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=352.9s)]
*  We need a more rational approach to how we manage the economy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=353.9s)]
*  It's like being on an airplane that simply in order to stay in the air has to continue [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=357.78s)]
*  to accelerate. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=361.38s)]
*  I mean, you don't want to be on that machine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=362.38s)]
*  It's extremely dangerous. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=364.46s)]
*  For me, when we talk about degrowth with people who are actually unacquainted, my starter [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=373.46s)]
*  is always, how would you make your life a little bit more meaningful? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=378.34s)]
*  Meaningfulness is very much obtained through our kind of nourishing empathy, helping others. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=383.66s)]
*  Many groups don't necessarily tag themselves as degrowth, but you would see that their [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=390.42s)]
*  gender, their way of being and their kind of overall framework of reference is very [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=395.82s)]
*  much the one of degrowth. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  Today was the first day of the Forum for the Eco-Social Transition. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  We tried to think how the future would look like in 2040. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=412.38s)]
*  We tried to advocate for what would be a degrowth scenario, but also being aware that we live [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=419.38s)]
*  in the global north and a degrowth scenario would mean that we would have to change a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=423.74s)]
*  lot of our lifestyle. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=427.42s)]
*  Advocates of degrowth believe that rich countries use more resources, which hurts the environment. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=429.5s)]
*  The waste from these resources usually ends up in poorer countries, so even though it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=434.78s)]
*  seems that rich countries are doing better, in reality they are just passing the problems [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=439.7s)]
*  to others. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=444.02s)]
*  The solution lies, degrowthers say, in dramatically reducing material and energy consumption in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=445.02s)]
*  the global north while still focusing on people's well-being. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=451.14s)]
*  So Catalonia is a place where there's a story of the existence of cooperatives, which are [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=458.14s)]
*  economic enterprises that are not based on profit-making for the accumulation of benefits, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=463.62s)]
*  but actually that try to do their activity with the goal of satisfying needs. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=468.78s)]
*  We see this as a growing tendency. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=473.78s)]
*  A clear example is the housing sector. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=475.7s)]
*  Here, for example, it's quite a new tendency and it's growing a lot, definitely showing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=477.46s)]
*  also that alternatives are possible. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=481.34s)]
*  Proponents of degrowth argue for a democratisation of the economy and for collectively managing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=487.34s)]
*  key resources like housing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=492.5s)]
*  The proposed scaling up exists in solutions like housing cooperatives. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=494.94s)]
*  I won't be able to sell my apartment in a couple of years so that we cannot speculate [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=525.3000000000001s)]
*  with housing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=531.5s)]
*  So this is one of the biggest common spaces that we have in the ground floor. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=534.5s)]
*  Basically here we do assemblies, we do birthday parties, we do dinners. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  Apart from reducing the impact of energy and material-wise, we are also bonding community [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=544.7s)]
*  strengths. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  We are basically being more autonomous and working for getting that autonomy, which [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=552.9s)]
*  allow us to be less in the market system. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=558.1s)]
*  So basically the architectural frame is a cooperative, also the construction company [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=562.54s)]
*  that has built this building. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=567.14s)]
*  And the way that this works is that you are basically only paying for the material price [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=570.14s)]
*  and the salary price. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=574.3s)]
*  There is no industrial benefit on that because it's for non-profit. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=575.62s)]
*  This is what we call the library of things. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=580.82s)]
*  So we have many kinds of different things that we use from time to time. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=583.1400000000001s)]
*  So we share them here. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=587.82s)]
*  We have them here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=588.82s)]
*  We need them, we take them and we put them back. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=589.82s)]
*  Normally in conventional apartments in Barcelona what you get is kind of narrow corridors. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=591.82s)]
*  While here that's where you have the entrance doors to all the different apartments. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=598.62s)]
*  So it's really a place where kind of life in community happens a lot. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=603.62s)]
*  But what exactly are de-growthers proposing? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=611.82s)]
*  The main thing is we have to scale down less necessary forms of production. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=617.82s)]
*  So let's have an open democratic conversation about what kinds of production we really do [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=622.82s)]
*  need to increase. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=626.82s)]
*  So things like solar panels and public transit, regenerative food supplies. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=628.82s)]
*  I mean we need these things. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=633.82s)]
*  And what forms of production are clearly destructive and actually not necessary for our society. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=635.82s)]
*  So SUV production, private jet production, industrial beef, fast fashion, advertising, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=639.82s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=646.82s)]
*  I mean there's huge portions of our productive system that are mobilized around goods and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=647.82s)]
*  services that are actually not necessary for society and mostly exist to enrich elites. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=652.82s)]
*  Spending less on the fence would of course prove controversial. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=658.82s)]
*  And this approach would cost jobs. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=662.82s)]
*  Jobs like the one Mike left behind. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=665.82s)]
*  This is something that we scare our guests with. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=670.82s)]
*  In the supermarket the mushrooms, these kinds of oyster mushrooms that you'd get there [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=673.82s)]
*  are almost always grown in grow bags. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=677.82s)]
*  And we can make this happen completely naturally. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=680.82s)]
*  You know I can't tell you how happy people are even if they manage to grow one thing. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=688.82s)]
*  It's mind blowing for people. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=692.82s)]
*  I remember what that was like. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=694.82s)]
*  I was one of those people 25 years ago. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=695.82s)]
*  I worked for almost 20 years as an urban designer. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=698.82s)]
*  I wasn't blind to the fact that I was blatantly working within the real estate system. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=702.82s)]
*  Even though I was a sustainability consultant. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=707.82s)]
*  You realize there's a materials blindness in what we ignore when we're studying sustainability. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=712.82s)]
*  At least in the early 21st century. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=717.82s)]
*  Because none of these technologies that we as designers were being encouraged by their [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=719.82s)]
*  manufacturers to fit into our designs can be made without fossil fuels. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=725.82s)]
*  I felt cheated. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=729.82s)]
*  This was not something I was aware of. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=731.82s)]
*  We're fighting against the idea that green growth is possible. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=734.82s)]
*  We're trying to highlight that a bigger change than perhaps most people are comfortable with immediately [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=740.82s)]
*  is what's required. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=745.82s)]
*  What the economy called externalities. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=747.82s)]
*  And they say that we could put a price in externalities and close the economic circle. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=752.82s)]
*  This is just imagination. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=760.82s)]
*  It's not like this physically. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=762.82s)]
*  And the calculations that we have is that only 10% of materials or less are recycled. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=764.82s)]
*  90% of what comes into the economy becomes waste. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=771.82s)]
*  This time I think to think about scaling back and reducing our energy use and satisfying that with [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=776.82s)]
*  renewable energies in a decentralized, in a planned, in a careful way. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=782.82s)]
*  This maybe could be possible. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=786.82s)]
*  But thinking of the current gigantic system 10 times bigger and serviced by renewables [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=788.82s)]
*  starts getting in the sphere of fantastic I think. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=793.82s)]
*  Degrowth Economics [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=801.82s)]
*  Degrowth Economics champions social justice, arguing that market demands and social inequalities [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=805.82s)]
*  fuel the issues around climate change. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=811.82s)]
*  It also argues that relentless global growth in production and consumption is not just unsustainable, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=814.82s)]
*  but economically disastrous, especially for the most vulnerable. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=820.82s)]
*  So I teach people in the masters, at ICTA, the Degrowth Masters, and I see that young people of, you know, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=824.82s)]
*  20s are much more aware of the tight linkages between what's happening in terms of environmental degradation, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=830.82s)]
*  in terms of climate change, and social inequalities and injustices at global and local levels. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=838.82s)]
*  So I think that awareness has increased tremendously, and that's why these fields now are becoming more prominent [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=843.82s)]
*  and people want to study and learn more. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=847.82s)]
*  You know there's a mix of excitement and stress and chaos. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=849.82s)]
*  And passion. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=853.82s)]
*  And a lot of passion. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=854.82s)]
*  A lot of passion. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=855.82s)]
*  Degrowth Economics [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=857.82s)]
*  Right now we are very, very close to opening the exhibition, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=861.82s)]
*  which is our final project of the Master in Degrowth. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=866.82s)]
*  Wow, I want to meet the artist behind this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=869.82s)]
*  Degrowth Economics [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=872.82s)]
*  We have been working on creating an exhibition that is based on social transformations. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=875.82s)]
*  How do we engage more people into joining actively or emotionally with social transformations into a more just and equal world? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=881.82s)]
*  I did an investigation about people's opinions around the topics of Degrowth. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=896.82s)]
*  I found that many people were also very, very in support of Degrowth and these ideas, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=901.82s)]
*  but I also found that maybe many people don't really grasp how much of a change that would entail [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=907.82s)]
*  and also what their own tools are of changing something. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=914.82s)]
*  Look at what we have. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=920.82s)]
*  Much better. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=925.82s)]
*  We think that one thing that's hindering social transformations is a lot that people are afraid of many things. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=927.82s)]
*  Afraid of change, afraid of destabilizing their lives. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=933.82s)]
*  And we always ask them one question is, do you feel secure? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=938.82s)]
*  And that always ended up opening a conversation about what causes a form of security or insecurity [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=941.82s)]
*  and always what they related that to. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=947.82s)]
*  Historically cities have been divided by class, by race, by ethnicity. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=956.82s)]
*  But what we see now is that this move towards building resilient cities, green cities, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=962.82s)]
*  is accompanied by this, let's say, pervasive green divide that continues because of dynamics of what we call green gentrification. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=967.82s)]
*  Barcelona is part of a larger study that we conducted of 28 cities where we found that in 17 of those cities, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=978.82s)]
*  greening is a contributor to gentrification, that is to the displacement of socially vulnerable residents [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=986.82s)]
*  due to different processes of real estate speculation, competitive urbanism. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=993.82s)]
*  One of the conclusions of our study is the need to make public spaces really public again [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1002.82s)]
*  and being an amenity for everyone in the city. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1007.82s)]
*  That is actually very closely connected to degrowth and to the role of the commons in people's lives. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1010.82s)]
*  Doing more equitable greening would be also involving people in the decisions taken about where to implement what. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1017.82s)]
*  So being also very much about participatory democracy and decision making involving the most vulnerable people and so on. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1023.82s)]
*  Critics of degrowth argue that it would cause huge changes to society and that it would make people worse off. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1041.82s)]
*  I think degrowth underestimates the power of innovation. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1048.82s)]
*  Degrowth underestimates the need for investment that we need in new technology and in new solutions. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1053.82s)]
*  And degrowth underestimates the social sort of feasibility of what they propose. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1061.82s)]
*  So growth has very successfully over many decades lifted large numbers of people out of poverty. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1067.82s)]
*  That in and of itself is one of the reasons why you get in the way of economic growth at your peril. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1073.82s)]
*  In the UK since 1990 we get three times the amount of economic prosperity out of a tonne of CO2 than we did in 1990. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1079.82s)]
*  So that's a big decoupling. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1088.82s)]
*  The speed at which that has happened hasn't been sufficient but we sort of are in the S curve in the accelerating part of those technological changes so things can speed up. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1090.82s)]
*  Policies which would result in a smaller economy unless staggeringly carefully implemented would result in the immiseration of large numbers of people. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1101.82s)]
*  So you certainly need to accompany it with a dramatic experiment. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1112.82s)]
*  Now there may be ways of doing that but that will be a very, very risky experiment indeed in my view. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1117.82s)]
*  Reducing your own material consumption, not throwing good food away and these kind of things are very much ingrained in for everyone kind of. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1131.82s)]
*  But that this might need systemic change, that needs to be politically activated or that needs stronger political participation that was not so often in people's minds. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1141.82s)]
*  The growth is not an idea of how things should be and pushing everyone like a flock of birds or sheep into the same direction. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1154.82s)]
*  But it's just building conversations upon how can we make an alternative future happen. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1163.82s)]
*  We do get a fair number of people who come here and go look I know that only 9% of my recycling gets recycled. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1171.82s)]
*  So what can I do? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1177.82s)]
*  It's helping those people see that small actions can cause behavioural contagion but also possibly helping them be a little bit more radical in their choices and helping them feel like they're not trapped in the system as much as they might think they are. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1180.82s)]
*  It's very clear that our political class is unable right now to resolve the contradictions of our economic system and all sorts of competing ideas are rushing into full avoid. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1196.82s)]
*  It's urgent that we prioritize a sort of transition that is going to be just and ecological not one that is going to be deeply inequitable and deeply destructive. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1206.82s)]
*  In May 2023 the EU Parliament hosted the Beyond Growth Conference in Brussels emphasizing the need to change the current economic system. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1215.82s)]
*  This event was viewed by many as a sign of mainstream support for some of the ideas of degrowth shifting the movement from the periphery towards the centre. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1225.82s)]
*  But can degrowth really change the world or would it greatly damage society? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1235.82s)]
*  What is clear is time is running out and urgent changes are needed if we want to safeguard the future of humanity. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8&t=1241.82s)]
