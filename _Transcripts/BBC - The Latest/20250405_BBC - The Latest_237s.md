Video Description: US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country.
 
"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark'," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal." The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance.
 
Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday.

# TikTok US deadline extended by President Trump | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI)
*  Donald Trump has again extended a deadline for the sale of TikTok. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=0.0s)]
*  It will allow the video sharing app to remain available in the United States for another 75 days. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=4.24s)]
*  The platform was hours away from a deadline to be sold by its Chinese owner or face a US ban. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=10.0s)]
*  Mr Trump said he did not want to go dark as he put it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=16.56s)]
*  The deadline was initially extended in January. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=20.0s)]
*  Our North America correspondent explained to me the thinking behind the extension. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=23.28s)]
*  Well, the thinking is, you know, he needs extra time to complete this deal, which, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=30.4s)]
*  according to reports, has been in the works for many weeks, but was actually very close to being [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  consummated by Wednesday. It calls for the US operations of TikTok to be spun off from the main [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=42.0s)]
*  Chinese parent bite dance and for bite dance to retain a minority stake on the order of about 20%. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  But then came the trade war. The tariffs got in the way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=55.2s)]
*  And initially, the thinking on Trump's part was that he could use tariffs against China [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=59.2s)]
*  as a cudgel, offering tariff relief in exchange for Beijing's blessing of a deal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=63.68s)]
*  That is not quite how things ended up turning out. As we're seeing today, there's now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=70.0s)]
*  a move on China's part to retaliate against the tariffs imposed by Trump not to play ball. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=74.48s)]
*  So what do we think is going to happen next? Of course, we've got this extension, but is that long enough? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, it's a little bit of a wait and see. We have 75 more days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=88.24s)]
*  And from the user's perspective, they're very happy to hear that. That's another two and a half months [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=92.96s)]
*  where they get to continue spending hours upon end in some cases on the app. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  There's 170 million American users on the app. And I think from the perspective of negotiation, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=102.88s)]
*  of negotiators within the Trump administration, it gives them extra time, obviously. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=110.48s)]
*  They say that they were very close to a deal that, you know, in Trump's words, they had made [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=114.48s)]
*  tremendous progress, but that this deal required more work. And really, what's at issue here is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  the fact that Beijing needs to sign off on any deal. If they don't give a blessing, the blessing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=126.56s)]
*  to ByteDance to sell the app, there's no sale. But it was interesting hearing from ByteDance today [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=132.24s)]
*  because of the way they're positioning this. They're not talking about a sale or a potential [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=138.48s)]
*  deal. They're talking about a potential solution. And today in a statement, we saw them acknowledging [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  really for the first time that they have been in conversations with the U.S. government, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  but not using that terminology that a sale is in the work, saying a solution has been under [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  discussion, but that they haven't been able to reach one ultimately. It is, like you say, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=158.48s)]
*  a bit of a wait and see. But what if TikTok does, as Donald Trump puts it, go dark in the U.S.? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=163.84s)]
*  Well, it did go dark for about 12 hours in mid-January. And it was actually quite [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=171.36s)]
*  interesting watching very devoted TikTok users almost holding a funeral-like kind of set of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=178.16s)]
*  live streams on the app, just sitting around together on the app, virtually, of course, and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=187.2s)]
*  mourning the passage of the app. People are really attached to this. And not only do they enjoy it, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=193.92s)]
*  but they also say to us that they learn things on the app. They say that in some cases it's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  actually an important income stream for them. So I think there will be quite a revolt among the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  users of TikTok if TikTok were to go dark. But Donald Trump said in his statement today on Truth [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=211.12s)]
*  Social, his social media platform, that he doesn't want it to go dark. You might remember in 2020, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=217.6s)]
*  he was the one who initiated trying to ban TikTok here in the U.S. It got stuck in the courts, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=222.4s)]
*  and now he thinks TikTok helped him win a lot of young voters here in the U.S. So he's a devotee [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  and says he wants to make sure that it stays online. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeGzhpbYfI&t=234.64000000000001s)]
