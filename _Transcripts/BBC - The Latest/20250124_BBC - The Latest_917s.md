# Storm Éowyn: Danger to life warnings as ‘once in a generation’ storm hits UK and Ireland | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg)
*  Millions of people have been urged to stay at home as storm Eowyn is bringing potential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=0.0s)]
*  life-threatening winds to Ireland and the UK. The Met Office has issued a rare red weather [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=4.4s)]
*  warning for Northern Ireland and the Scottish central belt, which means a danger to life. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=10.48s)]
*  4.5 million people received an emergency phone alert. Many schools and large parts of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=15.68s)]
*  transport network will be closed in these areas. As you can see from this map, it's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=21.16s)]
*  a giant storm where coastal areas could see winds of up to 100mph. An amber weather warning [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=25.64s)]
*  is in place for the rest of Scotland, Northern England and North Wales, with separate yellow [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=32.36s)]
*  warnings for wind and rain covering the rest of the UK. Eowyn is also battering Ireland, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=37.24s)]
*  which has recorded wind speeds of 114mph in Galway, the fastest since records began. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=42.84s)]
*  Here's the latest from Jo Inwood. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=49.6s)]
*  With winds of over 100mph, there's only so much you can do to prepare for a storm like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=53.8s)]
*  Eowyn. First to feel its force was the Republic of Ireland. A red warning is in place for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=58.36s)]
*  the entire country. Here, it's being called the storm of the century. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=64.0s)]
*  Next in the path of Eowyn is Northern Ireland, where alerts have already sounded on people's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=69.6s)]
*  phones. All schools will be closed, the first time this has happened since 2017. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=74.32s)]
*  Well, it's always difficult, I suppose, to make a decision to close the school. And [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=82.52s)]
*  I can understand the Department and the Education Authority making the decision, albeit quite [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=86.8s)]
*  late on. I suppose really the health and welfare safety of children and the entire school community [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=91.56s)]
*  is really vitally important. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=96.44s)]
*  As it crosses the Irish Sea, gusts of up to 100mph are predicted before it hits Scotland. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=98.88s)]
*  There's a red warning in place for part of the central belt, and there'll be monitoring [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=106.12s)]
*  at this control room. But it's been decided it's too dangerous for any trains to run. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=110.46s)]
*  This is a major weather event, and keeping our customers and colleagues safe is our number [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=115.74s)]
*  one priority. Because of that, we've had to make the very difficult decision to withdraw [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=120.06s)]
*  all of our ScotRail services throughout Friday to make sure that we keep everybody safe. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=124.78s)]
*  Much of Wales and the north of England are under an amber warning. There, like everywhere [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=129.82s)]
*  else in Eowyn's path, disruption is expected, and the advice is to only travel if you really [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=134.4s)]
*  have to. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=139.78s)]
*  From this storm, we're expecting airborne issues, so debris potentially, power outages. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=142.82s)]
*  So our advice would be to plan journeys if you are making those journeys, think about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=150.98s)]
*  what you're doing in any circumstances, and keep safe. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=156.46s)]
*  Almost the whole of the UK is set to be under a yellow warning for high winds. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=161.5s)]
*  Yesterday in Cornwall, there were even reports of a tornado. It wasn't caused by storm Eowyn, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  but was a reminder of our increasingly unpredictable weather. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=173.22s)]
*  Jo Inwood, BBC News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  While many transport links are expected to be disrupted today, with ScotRail cancelling [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  all of its services, travel writer Simon Calder is at King's Cross station in London. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=185.82s)]
*  I cycled here this morning, and that was quite windy enough, thank you very much. And if [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  it continues, we could well see disruption at the UK's two busiest airports, London Heathrow [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=195.4s)]
*  and London Gatwick. That's because they are so heavily used. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=202.32s)]
*  But meanwhile, it is very much the story, as we've been hearing, Northern Ireland, Scotland, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=208.6s)]
*  extreme disruption. No public transport whatsoever in Northern Ireland. As you say, all Scottish [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=214.16s)]
*  trains cancelled. And that's not just on the Scottish operator ScotRail, but from here, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=221.04s)]
*  you cannot travel further than Newcastle, well within England, and on the West Coast [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=227.16s)]
*  main line, then you're advised not to try to travel north of Preston, which is basically [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=234.06s)]
*  about half way from London to Glasgow. Elsewhere, at the airports, we are seeing hundreds of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=239.32s)]
*  cancellations in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the two Belfast airports in particular, I'm counting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  well over 250 cancellations. And some of those are long haul flights to and from places like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=254.88s)]
*  Dubai and Doha in Qatar. So it's going to be difficult for people to make up time. But [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=262.6s)]
*  of course, as you've been reporting, the advice for anybody who's called up in one of these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=269.48s)]
*  areas is stay at home. And one reason it's so difficult for the airlines to operate is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  that actually staff are being told, stay at home. It's too dangerous for you to get to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  work. So I'm afraid it's going to be very messy for tens of thousands of people today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's speak to Professor Liz Bentley, Chief Executive of the Royal Meteorological Society. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=293.04s)]
*  Professor Bentley, thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. How potent a storm [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=299.16s)]
*  are we seeing here with Erwin? Oh, yeah. So one of the strongest storms we've seen for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  years. I mean, it's been called the storm of the century in the Republic of Ireland. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=309.56s)]
*  And we've already seen wind gusts of 114 miles per hour on the West Coast of Ireland. So [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=313.72s)]
*  that will break their all time wind gust record. So yeah, red warnings in place across the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  whole of the Republic of Ireland. It came into force across Northern Ireland at 7am [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=326.32s)]
*  this morning and will come into force at 10am across central Scotland. So we see that storm [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=331.08s)]
*  transferring from the west of Ireland or the strongest of the winds from the west of Ireland [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=336.52s)]
*  into Northern Ireland and then into Scotland over the course of the next few hours. So [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  what can people expect at its worst? Well, I think we've recorded, as I say, 114 miles [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=346.2s)]
*  per hour on the West Coast. That's probably the highest wind speed I think we'll see throughout [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=353.24s)]
*  this storm. But widespread gusts of 80 to 90 miles an hour in exposed places over the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=356.5s)]
*  higher ground on the coastal areas. We could see in excess of 100 miles per hour across [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=361.76s)]
*  Northern Ireland and Scotland as well. Those are damaging force winds. That is why we have [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  the red warnings in place. It really does mean danger to life. When you get winds that strong, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  it can pick up debris, large amounts of debris and fling them around, which obviously can [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=376.84s)]
*  cause real problems to people walking about or driving or to buildings causing damage. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  We are also seeing power cuts. So across Ireland there are 560 million homes and businesses. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  That's over half a million homes and businesses without power at the moment. Tens of thousands [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  already being reported now in Northern Ireland. So you can see as that storm transitions, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  the impact will transition as well across from Ireland to Northern Ireland and then [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=402.44000000000005s)]
*  into Scotland. How much further afield though will people feel the effects of this storm? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=407.32s)]
*  So yeah, there's warnings right across the UK. So yellow warnings everywhere, amber warnings [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=413.4s)]
*  for North Wales, Northern England and the whole of Scotland. The amber warning in the North of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=418.36s)]
*  Scotland doesn't come close until tomorrow morning. So the impact felt throughout the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  rest of today, tonight and first thing tomorrow as well. So widespread impacts. I'm already [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  seeing recordings of wind speeds on the Isle of Wight of 83 miles per hour and wind speeds across [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=434.28s)]
*  Northern Wales of 90 plus miles an hour. So widespread gusts, but I think the strongest [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=440.44s)]
*  of the winds, the most severe of the weather is Northern Ireland and into central Scotland. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=445.88s)]
*  Professor Liz Bentley from the Royal Meteorological Society, always good to get to your [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  insights. Thank you very much for joining us on the board. It will be a very busy day for you, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure. Thank you. Thank you. Let's speak to our Ireland correspondent Chris Page. Chris, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=458.92s)]
*  you're in Westport, which isn't that far at all, is it, from where that record wind speed's been [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=465.16s)]
*  recorded? Yeah, it's about 70 miles north of Maeshead in County Galway where that record gust of 114 [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=469.8s)]
*  miles an hour was recorded four hours ago. So really the winds are, we're told, peaking here in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  County Mayo around now. It is absolutely ferocious and looking out to sea, it's very obviously just [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=484.52s)]
*  too dangerous to go right out into the middle of the storm. Debris is crashing around everywhere. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  There are very few vehicles on the road. People generally, it seems, heeding the authorities' [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=498.12s)]
*  advice to stay indoors, stay at home if you possibly can. We are sheltering from the winds [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  here in a tunnel, so while we've got a good view of what's happening here on the coast, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=510.6s)]
*  we are very much among those making efforts to keep ourselves safe. Across the Republic of Ireland [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=517.32s)]
*  now we're told the number of homes and businesses without power is over 700,000. That is also an [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=524.44s)]
*  unwelcome record. Never before have there been that number of people without electricity in this [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=531.4s)]
*  town of Westport. Power's out all over the town. Also broadband is down, mobile phone signals [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=537.88s)]
*  are coming and going, so there is disruption everywhere. Clearly there's also going to be a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=544.52s)]
*  lot of damage and destruction, unfortunately, by the time this storm blows through and that won't [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=549.8s)]
*  happen for maybe about another three hours in this part of Ireland. Chris, for the moment, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=556.68s)]
*  thank you very much. Let's talk to one of our other correspondents, our Ireland correspondent, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=562.6s)]
*  Sarah Gerven, who's in Donaghaddy on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland. It must be difficult [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=568.52s)]
*  at times to stand upright, Sarah. Yeah, I mean, I did have a hat on just before speaking to you [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=576.0400000000001s)]
*  and it blew right off my head. I was heroically retrieved by my camera operator, but it is getting [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=583.96s)]
*  really, really fierce here. I am talking to you, but when those gusts of winds hit you, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=590.84s)]
*  honestly, they take your breath away. So, just like that. So I will keep, I'll try my best to keep [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=597.4s)]
*  speaking to you. But the major issue we're hearing from people in Northern Ireland this morning [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  is that lack of electricity. You heard from Chris there in the Republic of Ireland, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=608.76s)]
*  over 700,000 people there without power. The figure is just under 100,000 in Northern Ireland. So lots [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  of people waking up this morning without electricity and they'll be hoping to solve that as [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=620.68s)]
*  soon as possible. There's lots of advice coming through on how to get through Storm Ion today. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  The red alert is in place in Northern Ireland until 2 p.m. If you do have electricity, make sure [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=630.68s)]
*  your devices are charged so that you can keep up to date with what's happening. Police saying that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=638.28s)]
*  you should have torches available in case light sources go out and to have extra blankets and also [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=643.4799999999999s)]
*  to check in with people that you may know of who may be a bit more vulnerable, maybe frightened [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=649.8s)]
*  in these conditions. Now, police at Northern Ireland did say yesterday they are treating this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=654.68s)]
*  as a major incident. They have said the wind speeds that we are dealing with right now could [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=659.8s)]
*  be the strongest that have been seen in Northern Ireland since 1998. The authorities here say [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  that they are prepared for the storm, they're prepared for what's coming, what's going on right [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=671.8s)]
*  now and the clean up, but they've asked individuals to make their own preparations. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=676.36s)]
*  There's two major key pieces of advice as you've heard from Chris as well. Don't travel if you don't [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=681.24s)]
*  have to today and stay indoors to see out the worst of Storm Ion. Sarah, we will let you get [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=686.52s)]
*  your breath back if you can. Thank you very much. That's Sarah Gerbin in Donaghade in Northern Ireland. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=693.0s)]
*  Our correspondent David Wallace-Lockhart is in Glasgow and the east coast of Scotland, David, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=699.24s)]
*  really feeling the brunt of this? Well, west where I am, certainly wind starting to pick up [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=704.68s)]
*  at the moment in Glasgow here and sometimes not too bad, but then just occasionally you're getting [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=713.2399999999999s)]
*  quite a big gust that moves you about a bit. Have been winds of over 70 miles per hour recorded in [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=719.8s)]
*  Scotland and like I say, not until 10 o'clock does the red warning come into effect, but you can see [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=725.88s)]
*  occasionally behind me some of the trees start straining. We've got a bit of a sheltered spot [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=732.36s)]
*  here next to a building, but by the River Clyde occasionally when there's a gust you see the big [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=736.6s)]
*  spurts of water going over the top of it. The bushes on the far side really bending in the wind, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=742.04s)]
*  giving you a bit of a sense of what's to come. Now obviously there's already been disruption here. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=748.12s)]
*  This red warning is going to cover the central belt of Scotland and beyond. That will be including [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=753.72s)]
*  Glasgow and Edinburgh. It's where the majority of Scots live and the vast majority of schools [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=759.48s)]
*  in the country are going to be closed. There's that transport disruption already, no ScotRail [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=764.84s)]
*  trains running, no ferries going to the islands in Scotland, airports telling passengers to check [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=769.96s)]
*  before they try and make any sort of journey because there will be disruption there. So [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=776.84s)]
*  certainly widespread disruption expected and similar advice to Northern Ireland, it's to stay [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=782.6s)]
*  at home, it's to only travel if it's absolutely necessary because we are expecting gusts of up to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=788.68s)]
*  100 miles an hour. It's a red warning which of course comes with that cautionary [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=795.4s)]
*  warning about the risk of a threat to life. David, for the moment thank you very much. David Wallace [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=802.76s)]
*  Lockhart in Glasgow with the picture as you can see of what it's looking like already in Scotland. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=808.3599999999999s)]
*  Well let's just take you around some of the live pictures that we've got coming in. First [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=813.88s)]
*  let's take you to Ballyholm in Bangor in Northern Ireland. We were just speaking to two of our [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=819.32s)]
*  correspondents there where of course some of the worst disruption is due to hit Northern Ireland [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=825.96s)]
*  and also Scotland as David was just saying. This is Bays Loch on the east coast of Bernere [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=832.68s)]
*  in the outer Hebrides of Scotland with the gusts as we've been hearing of up to 100 miles an [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=839.72s)]
*  hour expected in some coastal areas. Let's stay in Scotland and go to Largs which is on the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=846.76s)]
*  east coast just east of Glasgow. Millions of people of course across this red affected area [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=854.2s)]
*  where this rare red weather warning is in place being told to stay at home, not to travel if they [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=862.36s)]
*  can avoid it at all. And back to Glasgow itself where we were just seeing how it's just starting [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=868.28s)]
*  to pick up and how the widespread disruption is really going to affect people. Ferries crossings [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  cancelled, flights cancelled. There is on our website a live page reporting on all of the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=882.28s)]
*  developments of storm Aon. You can also read some assessments from one of our colleagues [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=889.0s)]
*  BBC weather presenter Judith Ralston. She says that she hasn't seen a forecast as severe as this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=894.84s)]
*  in her whole career and she describes storm Aon as once in a generation. You can listen to her [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=901.96s)]
*  overview on a short film that's embedded in that web page. Much more on that storm around the world [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=907.88s)]
*  and across the UK. This is BBC News. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiC5SERH2Gg&t=914.68s)]
