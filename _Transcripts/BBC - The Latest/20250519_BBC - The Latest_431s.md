# US President Trump says Russia and Ukraine to ‘immediately’ start ceasefire negotiations | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA)
*  President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have both been reacting positively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=0.0s)]
*  after they spent two hours talking on the phone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It comes as Washington continues to push to end the fighting in Ukraine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=9.44s)]
*  Well, in the last hour, the American leader has posted on social media about the talks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=12.64s)]
*  He said he believes the call went very well, adding that Russia and Ukraine will immediately [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=16.96s)]
*  start negotiations towards a ceasefire and more importantly, bring an end to the war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=22.52s)]
*  He went on, the tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent before adding that Russia wants [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=28.58s)]
*  to do large scale trade with the United States when this catastrophic bloodbath is over. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=33.9s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=39.96s)]
*  Let's go straight to our correspondent at the White House, Nomiya Iqbal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=40.96s)]
*  Nomiya, just to be clear, first of all, we're talking here about negotiations about a ceasefire, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=45.42s)]
*  not negotiations exactly about ending the war permanently. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  And there's no breakthrough, I would say, in those peace negotiations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  And I would say that President Trump portrayed this conversation more positively than Vladimir Putin did. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=63.14s)]
*  He talked about possible future peace agreements. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=70.02s)]
*  Donald Trump said that he, well, I mean, he said that, as you mentioned there, the conversation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  was warm and friendly. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=80.32s)]
*  But he focused a lot more on the economic benefits that might be in store for Russia [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=82.74s)]
*  and Ukraine when the war ends. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Essentially, what it sounds like is President Trump is saying it's up to both sides to work [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=90.76s)]
*  it out and essentially come up with the conditions for a negotiation, for a ceasefire and ultimately [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=95.98s)]
*  to end the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=102.76s)]
*  And it's up to them to decide. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=105.28s)]
*  And so it's not really the US walking away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=107.72s)]
*  It sounds like they will continue to push both sides to work it out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=110.0s)]
*  But ultimately, he's letting them decide. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=115.12s)]
*  And that's where I think there is that huge challenge, because we know that there are [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=118.36s)]
*  things that Russia will not concede on and there are things that Ukraine will not concede on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=122.44s)]
*  Mr. Trump did say that he has informed President Zelensky, as well as other key allies, including [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  the European Commissioner, about the phone conversation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=134.96s)]
*  But as I say, there was no major breakthrough in that conversation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think there was expected to be. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  OK, Nomiya, thank you very much for that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=145.6s)]
*  Nomiya Iqbal at the White House for us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=147.88s)]
*  Well, the Russian leader has also been speaking about that conversation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=150.44s)]
*  President Putin said it was, in his words, very informative and quite a frank talk. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  We agreed with the President of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=162.16s)]
*  to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum regarding a possible future peace treaty, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=166.72s)]
*  supplying a number of positions, such as the principles of resolution, the timeline for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=172.2s)]
*  a potential peace agreement and so on, including the possible cessation of hostilities for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=176.76s)]
*  a certain period in the event of reaching specific agreements. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=181.6s)]
*  A short time ago, I spoke to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, in Moscow, and he gave us [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=185.96s)]
*  his reaction to what we have heard about the Russian side of this phone call. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=191.4s)]
*  It doesn't seem as if much has changed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=196.64s)]
*  I remember America, European leaders and Ukraine had been pushing Russia to sign up to a 30-day [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  unconditional ceasefire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=205.76s)]
*  Russia hasn't done that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Russia has been resisting that all along, and still after this conversation there's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  no talk about a ceasefire now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=214.0s)]
*  However, Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, after Vladimir Putin's comments said, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  I think in an attempt to flatter Donald Trump, talked about how Russia saw America as a neutral [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=224.44s)]
*  party now and basically blamed Europe for wanting the war to continue, trying to drive [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=231.12s)]
*  a wedge between America and Europe and try to flatter Donald Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=236.64s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=241.32s)]
*  Well, we're joined now by Daniel Beiman, who is the director of the Warfare, Irregular [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=242.64s)]
*  Threats and Terrorism Program at the Think Tank, the Centre for Strategic and International [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=247.28s)]
*  Studies. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=252.2s)]
*  Daniel, thank you very much for joining us on BBC News to talk about this developing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=253.2s)]
*  story from what you've heard, the readout from Russia and the US. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=257.36s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=263.2s)]
*  There's a lot of very vague words and promises. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=265.96s)]
*  So there seems to be an effort to work toward a ceasefire. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=269.4s)]
*  There could be some sort of memorandum, but any of the content, any of the principles [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  remains very unclear. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=279.36s)]
*  Given how far apart the two parties were before the phone calls, I'm not sure how much closer [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=280.92s)]
*  we are now, despite all the rhetoric. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=285.56s)]
*  Yeah, one of my Russian speaking colleagues here in the newsroom sent me a message saying [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=287.88s)]
*  that there is a saying in the Russian language, we negotiate to negotiate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=292.24s)]
*  I mean, all hopes for a ceasefire. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=297.44s)]
*  This seems to be, you know, stretching out with no specific time frame at the moment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=300.2s)]
*  Yet we know that President Trump is very impatient. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=306.8s)]
*  So where do you think that's going to lead to? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=309.76s)]
*  So one of Russia's hopes is that President Trump will get tired of the whole thing and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=312.84s)]
*  simply say that the United States is not going to be involved anymore. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=318.08s)]
*  And this would be an end of economic aid and end of military aid to Ukraine. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  So of course, that benefits Russia. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=327.24s)]
*  So I think Putin probably calculates that inaction and delay on his part is going to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=329.24s)]
*  help Russia's position in the long term, especially if Russia is not the one blamed for any problems. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=334.76s)]
*  And we're waiting to hear still from President Zelensky. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the obvious person that we're still waiting to hear from after these these conversations, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  these discussions, this phone call between President Trump and President Putin. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=349.44000000000005s)]
*  Minutarily, Daniel, what position are Ukraine and Russia in right now with regards to prosecuting [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=353.88000000000005s)]
*  this war, continuing this war? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=362.12s)]
*  So Russia has been making progress against Ukraine in the last 10 months, but it's very [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=365.44s)]
*  slow, really incremental progress at best. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=371.36s)]
*  Russia has taken staggering losses. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=374.92s)]
*  So although many people describe Russia as having the upper hand, and that's probably [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=377.2s)]
*  true, the actual military advantage it's gained has been quite slight. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=381.64s)]
*  So we're not likely to see dramatic changes on the battlefield in the coming months, unless, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  of course, we see an abandonment of Ukraine by its allies, in which case Ukraine runs [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=391.36s)]
*  out of ammunition and in general may suffer catastrophic loss. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=396.64s)]
*  So are you saying at the moment Russia doesn't see any strategic interest in a ceasefire? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=401.8s)]
*  Russia believes that Ukraine's going to crumble if it keeps hitting it, and especially if [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  the United States and Europe abandon it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=413.04s)]
*  So a ceasefire, especially a long term one, is probably not Russia's interest, according [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=415.2s)]
*  to how Putin defines it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=420.48s)]
*  OK, Daniel Byman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, good to get your [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  assessment of this developing news. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=428.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfaYed8O0iA&t=429.68s)]
