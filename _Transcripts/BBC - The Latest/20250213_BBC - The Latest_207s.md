# Is President Trumpâ€™s call with President Putin bad news for Ukraine? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0)
*  The pill that Ukraine is going to have to swallow to end this is getting increasingly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=0.0s)]
*  bitter by the day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=5.08s)]
*  Ukrainecast from BBC News. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=7.28s)]
*  Hello, this is Victoria Derbyshire in the Ukrainecast studio. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=12.16s)]
*  And hello, I'm Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent, also in the Ukrainecast studio. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=15.64s)]
*  Right, there's been so much movement in the last few hours. Let's go through it. Starting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  with President Trump's comments, this is some of what he posted on Truth Social a short [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=25.16s)]
*  time ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=30.96s)]
*  Does this mean, Frank Gardner, negotiations are now underway to end this war? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=55.16s)]
*  It does. It doesn't mean that there is going to be a successful outcome. The two sides [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=74.36s)]
*  are still very far apart as to what they want. President Putin thinks he is winning. He is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=78.96s)]
*  advancing slowly on the battlefield in the East, very slowly. But I think all of this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=84.56s)]
*  news will be welcomed in Moscow. The fact that President Trump has had a 90 minute nearly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=90.02s)]
*  phone call with President Putin that's been described as effectively cordial or constructive, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=95.56s)]
*  that's probably good news for world peace. It may not necessarily be good news for Ukraine [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=102.92s)]
*  because you know, almost certainly, the pill that Ukraine is going to have to swallow to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=108.64s)]
*  end this is getting increasingly bitter by the day. Today, I'm afraid is going to be [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=113.62s)]
*  for Ukraine a bit of a watershed moment because it's the day when we finally say goodbye to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=119.86s)]
*  the idea that whatever it for as long as it takes, all these mantras that Western leaders, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=128.26s)]
*  including Britain's Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer and Joe Biden and others have been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  saying for the last few years, we'll support Ukraine for however long it takes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=138.1s)]
*  Are you saying that, right, so the US is out of the picture now? Let's just... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=141.46s)]
*  Not completely. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay, but can European nations fill the gap? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=148.66s)]
*  No. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  If the US pulls out? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Sorry to preempt you there. They can't possibly fill the gap in terms of arm supplies. Now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=156.1s)]
*  there are plenty of voices in Ukraine saying we will fight on, but they can't win. That's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=162.34s)]
*  the problem. And you know, the world is, I'm sorry to say, tired of this terrible fight that is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=167.14s)]
*  ripping the heart out of the youth in both countries. Russia has the advantage when it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  comes to its industrial military heartland. It's churning out huge numbers of low quality weapons [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=179.77999999999997s)]
*  that can eventually overwhelm Ukrainian lines. It's throwing men and material at the Ukrainian [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=187.54s)]
*  lines, losing a thousand plus casualties every day. But it's got a thousand more to replace them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=194.66s)]
*  Ukraine doesn't have that luxury. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=200.82s)]
*  Ukrainecast from BBC News. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpvHVdjrW0&t=202.66s)]
