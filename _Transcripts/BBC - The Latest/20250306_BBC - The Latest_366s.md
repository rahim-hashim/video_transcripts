Video Description: The US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine, US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirmed on Wednesday.
 
He added that the Trump administration was pausing and reviewing "all aspects of this relationship".
 
The US has shared intelligence with Ukraine since the early stages of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.
 
It paused military aid to Kyiv on Monday following a dramatic breakdown in relations in the Oval Office last week, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was told to leave the White House after an angry meeting with US President Donald Trump.

# US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c)
*  Donald Trump has ordered a pause in intelligence sharing with Ukraine as part of his suspension [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=0.0s)]
*  of military assistance to Kyiv. It's a move that could seriously affect Ukraine's ability [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=6.16s)]
*  to target Russian forces and defend itself. But Mr. Trump has suggested he may be willing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=11.56s)]
*  to continue talks with Kyiv, and President Zelenskyy has said that Ukrainian and U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=18.2s)]
*  teams are working together with what he called forward momentum. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=23.5s)]
*  President Macron of France has announced he plans to hold a meeting of European Army chiefs [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=29.08s)]
*  in Paris next week, saying he wanted to believe the U.S. would stay at Europe's side, but [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  it had to be ready to fend for itself. We'll have more on that in a moment, but first from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=40.04s)]
*  Washington here's Sarah Smith. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=45.44s)]
*  America is back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=48.72s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump is back, five years since he last spoke to Congress. In [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=52.72s)]
*  this speech, he was able to signal that tensions between him and President Zelenskyy may be [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=58.04s)]
*  easing and peace talks could soon begin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=62.28s)]
*  Simultaneously we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=64.96s)]
*  that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=70.76s)]
*  Russia is, for now, still launching deadly attacks on Ukraine. Assaults that will be [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  much harder to prevent now America's stopped sharing military intelligence, as well as [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=82.6s)]
*  halting the supply of weapons and equipment. The U.S. believes that by harming Ukraine's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=87.92s)]
*  ability to defend itself, they have forced Mr. Zelenskyy to talk about peace on Donald [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=92.44s)]
*  Trump's terms. Today White House officials are already making plans for renewed talks [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=98.2s)]
*  with Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=103.16s)]
*  Just in the last 24 hours since the public statement from Zelenskyy and then these subsequent [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  conversations which I'm going to walk inside and continue, I think we're going to see movement [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  in very short order. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=116.64s)]
*  President Trump addressed the controversial trade tariffs he's opposed on Canada, Mexico [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=119.48s)]
*  and China, which many fear may spark a global trade war. Saying Americans may have to pay [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=123.56s)]
*  a price, but it would be worth it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=128.44s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again and it's happening [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=130.76s)]
*  and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=135.56s)]
*  that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=142.24s)]
*  On television, officials have to respond to diplomacy that's being done via social media. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=143.16s)]
*  This was posted by the Chinese embassy. Quote, if war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=148.16s)]
*  war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end. As Secretary [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=155.76s)]
*  of Defense, how do you take that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=161.16s)]
*  Well, we're prepared. Those who long for peace must prepare for war. That's why we're rebuilding [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=163.16s)]
*  our military. That's why we're reestablishing deterrence and the warrior ethos is because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=170.1s)]
*  we live in a dangerous world with powerful ascendant countries with very different ideologies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  Car makers in North America fear the tariffs will punish them. Vehicles and parts frequently [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  go back and forward over the Canadian and Mexican borders. They've been given a one-month [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  exemption from the 25% levy. After that, the administration says they should move their [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=189.66s)]
*  factories to the U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=194.42s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  President Trump enjoys the enthusiastic backing of his Republican colleagues, even those who [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=198.86s)]
*  used to advocate for free trade and back strong U.S. support for Ukraine. They are now cheering [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=203.36s)]
*  on his approach to peacemaking, even though he appears to be being much tougher on Ukraine [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=209.34s)]
*  than he is on Russia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=214.0s)]
*  Sarah Smith there reporting. Well, as you heard, despite the suspension of U.S. intelligence, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=216.58s)]
*  Washington and Kiev have said that both sides are aiming to hold talks to discuss a potential [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=220.94000000000003s)]
*  peace plan. Here's James Landau with more on what any agreement might involve. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=227.22s)]
*  What are the elements of a peace deal that might be discussed? Well, as we've just been [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=232.78s)]
*  hearing it's still very, very early days, but a few clues emerged at the Lancaster House [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=236.8s)]
*  talks at the weekend. President Macron suggested a temporary partial truce. This would cover [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=241.7s)]
*  attacks in the air, on the sea and against power plants, but not fighting on the ground [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=248.38s)]
*  in the East. President Zelensky echoed this in a tweet saying that a truce could involve [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=254.26s)]
*  a release of prisoners, a ban on missiles and drones, attacks on civilian infrastructure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=258.7s)]
*  and only of course if Russia would do the same. The idea is that a truce would be a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=264.02s)]
*  start. It would test Russia's good faith, give Donald Trump an early win and potentially [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=269.94s)]
*  create space for talks about a more lasting ceasefire. And if that were agreed, then Britain, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=274.68s)]
*  France and maybe some others would deploy a reassurance force to Ukraine to deter future [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=281.22s)]
*  Russian aggression, as the French president set out this evening. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine must not be invaded again by Russia and we have to prepare for that. We have to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=293.1s)]
*  support the Ukrainian army and it may well be that we can do that through the deployment [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=297.74s)]
*  of European forces. But all this presumes Donald Trump is on board and he won't agree [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=302.54s)]
*  a deal without getting access to Ukrainian minerals and he doesn't want the US military [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=308.02s)]
*  to help secure Ukraine's future. Let's not forget the Russians. Vladimir Putin wants [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine to be neutral outside NATO and demilitarised. He also wants to keep the territory he's seized [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=318.34s)]
*  and more in these regions here in red and he doesn't want any European force here in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=324.32s)]
*  Ukraine's, on Ukrainian soil. Now critics say that what Russia wants, the US can't deliver [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=329.78s)]
*  and the Ukrainians won't accept. Nothing much is going to happen in this until the Russians [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  make up their mind whether they want to stick with their pretty maximalist demands or can [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=343.22s)]
*  back down a bit. Unless they can do that, then I think the Trump administration will [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=350.72s)]
*  find it difficult to take this very far forward. So for all the fast diplomatic movement, agreement [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=356.6s)]
*  between these two may yet be still some way off. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hdLcio_8c&t=363.20000000000005s)]
