**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04)
*  Welcome back to today's verified live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Russia's former transport minister has been found dead today, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=2.56s)]
*  several hours after being fired by Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=6.24s)]
*  Officials say the body was discovered inside his car in a Moscow suburb [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=9.68s)]
*  and he'd most likely shot himself. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=13.84s)]
*  Well, let's go straight to Moscow and talk to the BBC's Russia editor, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=16.32s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=20.2s)]
*  And Steve, tell us a little more about what we know [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=21.36s)]
*  around the circumstances of the minister's death. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=24.36s)]
*  This is all we know so far. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=27.56s)]
*  So, this morning, the Kremlin announced that the transport minister, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=29.56s)]
*  Roman Stalvoit, was sacked. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=33.56s)]
*  A decree signed by President Putin appeared on the Kremlin website. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=36.56s)]
*  Then President Putin appeared with Mr Stalvoit's replacement, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=40.56s)]
*  the acting, the new acting transport minister on Russian state television. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=45.56s)]
*  This afternoon, the news broke that the former transport minister [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=49.56s)]
*  had been found dead in his car or near his car in a park on the edge of Moscow. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=54.56s)]
*  Reportedly with a pistol on the ground and Russian investigators said [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=63.56s)]
*  an investigation had been launched. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=68.56s)]
*  This was a suspected suicide, according to investigators. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=70.56s)]
*  So, quite dramatic turn of events today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=74.56s)]
*  First, the transport minister sacked and then found dead in the afternoon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=77.56s)]
*  I'm sure around the world perhaps he's not a familiar name, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=82.56s)]
*  but tell viewers a little more about him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=86.56s)]
*  Well, he was 53, Roman Stalvoit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=90.56s)]
*  He'd only been transport minister for just a little over a year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=93.56s)]
*  Before that, he'd been governor of Russia's Kursk region, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=97.56s)]
*  the region that borders Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=101.56s)]
*  And interestingly, the man who succeeded him in that job, Alexei Smirnov, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=104.56s)]
*  he was recently arrested and accused of large-scale fraud [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=110.56s)]
*  in connection with the construction of defensive fortifications [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=115.56s)]
*  on that Russia-Ukrainian border. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=119.56s)]
*  Now, we don't know whether any of that case has anything to do with Mr Stalvoit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=121.56s)]
*  He hasn't publicly been implicated in that corruption case. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=129.56s)]
*  But all we know is that he lost his job this morning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=134.56s)]
*  and he was found dead this afternoon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=138.56s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg, we wait for further developments. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=142.56s)]
*  Thanks for bringing us the very latest there, live from Moscow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZlgJ7LP04&t=145.56s)]
