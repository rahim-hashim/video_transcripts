# Why Author Ann Patchett bought a bookshop | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4)
*  This is going to sound like I'm treating you like a museum piece. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am a museum piece. Please bring it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=2.2s)]
*  And you are one of the best selling authors in America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=10.56s)]
*  You have had numerous big prizes translated into 30 languages, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=17.2s)]
*  hit after hit in the bestseller list. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=22.64s)]
*  And I love the fact that they are making you blush. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=25.36s)]
*  And my instinct is to be like, no, it's actually not as good as all that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=27.6s)]
*  You're not interviewing John Grisham. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=32.28s)]
*  But it really is as good as all that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=34.04s)]
*  Did you always know this is what you were going to do? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=36.24s)]
*  Well, I would say yes, if you were talking about writing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=40.0s)]
*  I would say no, if you were talking about writing successfully. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  I had a very labo-am vision of myself when I was young. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=49.08s)]
*  And I thought I would write, but that no one would ever read what I wrote. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=55.44s)]
*  I never, never thought about this life ever. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Why not? Why didn't you think you were going to be successful? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=66.64s)]
*  Because I wanted to make art and I wanted to write literary fiction, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=70.52s)]
*  and I just never associated that with success. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Also, when I was a child, I never thought about writers being alive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=79.08s)]
*  Because the people that we read were dead. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  I just didn't think that you could make art and be successful. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Never occurred to me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=92.64s)]
*  And did you think of this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Do you have in your mind as well a bookshop and now you own Parnassus [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=95.92s)]
*  and have become a fixture in Nashville? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  Was that also part of your vision for yourself? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=103.04s)]
*  Absolutely. Supporting other authors? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=105.44s)]
*  Absolutely not. No. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=107.2s)]
*  This came about because the bookstores in Nashville had closed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=110.12s)]
*  I met a woman named Karen Hayes who said, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=115.92s)]
*  I'm interested in partnering or I said, I don't know. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=120.12s)]
*  We came up with the idea over the course of lunch as Total Strangers [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=123.56s)]
*  that we would partner and open a bookshop together. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=127.88s)]
*  And she would be the owner manager and I would be a silent partner who funded it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And that changed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=137.68s)]
*  It wasn't that I wanted to open a bookstore. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=140.16s)]
*  It was that I didn't want to live in a city that didn't have a bookstore [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=143.32s)]
*  and somebody needed to do it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=146.84s)]
*  And it seemed civic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=148.4s)]
*  And then a couple of years ago, Karen retired. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=151.0s)]
*  And so now I own the whole bookstore. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=153.48s)]
*  So now I really fell into it backwards. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=157.04s)]
*  And it's been a wonderful thing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=159.4s)]
*  It's been a huge joy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=161.24s)]
*  But I was never somebody who thought someday a bookstore. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  How would you describe your novels? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=166.44s)]
*  If you were looking up on high from Anne Patchett and the body of her work, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  some people have asked me to describe how I would ask me how I would describe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=176.12s)]
*  your novels. And I thought, well, I'll ask you how you would describe them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=179.24s)]
*  Right. A group of people are thrown together [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=182.72s)]
*  and and they have to work things out because they are stuck. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=185.88s)]
*  I like a desert island scenario. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=192.0s)]
*  My first novel was set in a home for unwed mothers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=195.12s)]
*  Belcanto set in a terrorist situation where people can't leave the house. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Magicians assistant, they're stuck in a snowstorm. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=205.08s)]
*  I mean, again and again, state of wonder. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=207.36s)]
*  They're they're down in the Amazon in this place that nobody can get to or get out of. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=210.4s)]
*  I like people in confinement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=215.72s)]
*  And so they have to kind of keep going back to each other [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=219.24s)]
*  until they can work out their problems. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=223.12s)]
*  So it's about the relationships more than the setting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=224.48s)]
*  Yes, definitely. The setting, the setting is the fun. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  The setting is the frosting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=232.0s)]
*  And I can just design it and change it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  But it is always the relationships. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  How are people reading in a world where our attention span is so [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=239.88s)]
*  scattered, fragmented among 50 different apps and podcasts and news channels? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Has it changed the way we read? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=254.4s)]
*  I'm sure it has. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=256.48s)]
*  But back to when Karen and I were opening the store and everyone was saying, this is insane. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=257.96s)]
*  I remember we found a space that we really wanted to rent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=264.0s)]
*  And the person who owned the property said, oh, I would never rent to a bookstore. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=268.76s)]
*  Bookstores are dead. You guys are going to go out of business in six months. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=272.12s)]
*  We've been great. When we opened the store, it never occurred to us to have a romance section. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=275.88s)]
*  And then, I don't know how many years ago, five or six years ago, we had a shelf. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=282.84s)]
*  We had one shelf of romance. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  And now we have a whole section of romance, a big section of romance. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's true of all my friends who own bookstores all over the country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=295.56s)]
*  There are always going to be people who want to read. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=301.24s)]
*  And that is the fact that there isn't any one truth about the way people are, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=304.0s)]
*  how they get their entertainment, how they get their education. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=311.64s)]
*  And they all want a book. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=314.8s)]
*  So that's wonderful because there are people who are still going to be reading on their phones. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=316.56s)]
*  There are people who aren't reading at all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=322.04s)]
*  But history is full of people who didn't read at all. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=324.36s)]
*  I'm only here to serve the people who still want to read a book. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=327.52s)]
*  Do you think people come to you, Anne, in the context of kind of not of escapism, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=331.88s)]
*  but of seeing good in people or good in humanity? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=339.32s)]
*  I love your novels because people are nice to each other generally. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=346.72s)]
*  I mean, you get a couple of bad guys along the way, but not terribly many mean people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=354.24s)]
*  Is that in the world we live in where, you know, you look at the news out there and it is pretty grim? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  Is that in a is that you conscious of giving people a more optimistic view? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=366.08s)]
*  No. Of humanity? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  It's it's the world I see. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=374.52s)]
*  I look out through my own eyes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=378.88s)]
*  And if I'm reading the news, I can see lots and lots of horrible things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  But the people that I interact with every day, and I'm really wondering if this is true for you as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  Are really kind people every day. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=395.56s)]
*  The people I work with here at the bookstore, my friends, the people who come into the bookstore, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  the people that I see in the grocery store, the people that I see in my neighborhood, my neighbors who I love. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=405.08s)]
*  So there is so much kindness, decency, thoughtfulness [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  that I don't see represented often enough in fiction. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=419.12s)]
*  And it's not like, oh, I want to step in to fill the gap. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=424.6s)]
*  But in that sense, I am writing from experience. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=428.12s)]
*  And I I find I get a lot of flack about this, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=432.8s)]
*  that I'm writing fairy tales or that I'm out of touch or I don't know what a terrible world we live in. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=438.6s)]
*  But every day I go out and I walk my dog and the people that I see are so kind. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=446.68s)]
*  So shouldn't that also be represented? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=454.24s)]
*  The nice thing about my job is it's not like I write a novel and that is the one novel for the year. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=457.76s)]
*  I'm just a little tiny chip in in all of the books that are written. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  So if you want a book about a princess dating a dragon, I can show you what section to go to. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=470.92s)]
*  If you want a retelling of Huckleberry Finn, I can put that book in your hand. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=479.32s)]
*  I am not all books, but I am this book. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=486.32s)]
*  And in my world, there probably is more kindness than you might see in other books, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  but not more kindness than you might see in your daily life. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=497.28s)]
*  And you've never been tempted to think, actually, I'm going to write dark. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=502.28s)]
*  Or do you think you couldn't write dark if you wanted to because it's not what you see? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=507.8s)]
*  I'm not very good at dark. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=512.04s)]
*  I'm really not very good at villains at all. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=513.96s)]
*  And there are very few of them in my books. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=517.44s)]
*  In the Dutch House, that was an interesting story. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=520.92s)]
*  So I was interviewing Zadie Smith and Swingtime had just come out and my book, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=525.72s)]
*  Commonwealth, had come out and Commonwealth is a very autobiographical novel. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=531.48s)]
*  And Swingtime appeared to be an autobiographical novel. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  So I was asking Zadie about it and she was saying, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  autobiographical fiction isn't what has happened to us. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=545.24s)]
*  It's what we're afraid of happening. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=550.44s)]
*  It's what we fixate on and think about and worry about. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=553.04s)]
*  And in that moment, I thought, what am I afraid of? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  Who am I afraid of being? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=562.36s)]
*  What do I think about all the time? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=563.84s)]
*  I'm afraid of being a bad stepmother. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=565.52s)]
*  I'm actually a really good stepmother, I think. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=568.16s)]
*  But I've always been so afraid of doing anything that would make my husband's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=572.68s)]
*  children have a harder life because I love them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=579.08s)]
*  And I could immediately imagine a character who was a terrible stepmother [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=582.56s)]
*  and and manipulative and rage filled and horrible because that was my fear. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  And so Andrea, the character of the stepmother in the Dutch House, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  is probably my best villain. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=600.64s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=605.28s)]
*  Yeah, I tapped into the well of my villainous self. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what I just need to do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  But only once. I'll do it again. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=611.4s)]
*  You wrote three books before you had a major success. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=615.8s)]
*  Yes. I'm I'm always interested in how people keep going. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=619.24s)]
*  We interviewed Ken Follett for another series, and he also wrote [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=624.84s)]
*  numerous books that had no success at all, but he kept going until he had a success. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=627.56s)]
*  What was it after you'd written three books that didn't sell particularly well? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=632.28s)]
*  What? What? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=638.28s)]
*  I think I'd have given up. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=640.08s)]
*  And I think I just know. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  No, let me explain it to you. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  Many people would have given most people would have given up. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=645.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=648.44s)]
*  Many people who had written three novels that they had not been able to publish [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  would have given up. But I was doing great. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=655.44s)]
*  I mean, again, the secret to happiness is low expectations. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=659.96s)]
*  And so I never thought that I would have any success. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=664.4s)]
*  The fact that I had sold three books [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=668.4s)]
*  and made enough money to survive in a one room apartment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=671.92s)]
*  I was fantastic. I was king of the world. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=678.36s)]
*  So and I still I would get invited to festivals. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=682.28s)]
*  I had teaching jobs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=685.2s)]
*  That was doing great. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=687.44s)]
*  I was what you call a midlist author. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=688.8s)]
*  I wasn't it wasn't like a lady. Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=691.44s)]
*  It wasn't anything like, oh, I thought that I would give up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=694.04s)]
*  Oh, nor did I think I'm going to keep writing until I get my big breakthrough book. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  It it wasn't that when you then wrote Bel Canto and it was this huge success. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=703.68s)]
*  How did that change your expectations for your future novels? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  Did that in a way land you with this [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=714.92s)]
*  proposition of success that you had to keep fulfilling? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=718.68s)]
*  So Bel Canto sold as well as my first three books when it was in hardback. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=722.4000000000001s)]
*  People will come into the store all the time, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  clutching an old hardback copy of Bel Canto, and they'll say, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=733.84s)]
*  it's a first edition. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=737.84s)]
*  And I'll say they're all first editions [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=739.2s)]
*  because there wasn't a second printing in hardback. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=742.64s)]
*  They were only first editions and then in paperback. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  Because it wasn't an instant success. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=750.24s)]
*  Gosh, no. Then in paperback, the book really took off and sold so well. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=751.84s)]
*  And what changed between hardback and paperback apart from the price? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  It it was 9-11. Right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=763.2s)]
*  And in the same way, it was the Kite Runner and Bel Canto. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=766.4s)]
*  Those were the two books that really exploded in relation to September 11th, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=773.48s)]
*  because book clubs wanted to read about terrorism. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=779.16s)]
*  So, of course, what would you go to but a book about an opera singer [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=785.04s)]
*  being held captive in a giant mansion? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=789.76s)]
*  And they wanted to read about Afghanistan and they read the Kite Runner. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=793.64s)]
*  Just not at all related to reality. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=798.84s)]
*  But that was the thing that made the book a success. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=803.04s)]
*  And I don't in any way feel like, oh, I wrote three mediocre books [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=806.28s)]
*  and then I wrote a really good one. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=810.0s)]
*  It's it's just the luck of the draw how things change. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=811.76s)]
*  And so a lot of people said to me, how were you able to write another book after that? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=816.48s)]
*  Nobody's watching. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=823.36s)]
*  I'm not curing cancer. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=825.36s)]
*  I'm not a 14 year old girl on Instagram selling mascara to 20 million people. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=827.52s)]
*  It's literary fiction. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=834.32s)]
*  So I can I can do whatever I want. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=836.08s)]
*  There's no pressure. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=839.24s)]
*  You don't have a smartphone. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  You showed me your flip phone that you don't even know the number to. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=843.0s)]
*  And it isn't charged anyway. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  So I'm not quite sure why you carry it in your bag. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  And even your husband doesn't know the number. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=851.28s)]
*  So that's pretty useless. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=852.76s)]
*  You don't look at websites much apart from a little bit of research. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  You don't watch television. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=858.84s)]
*  I don't. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=862.52s)]
*  This is going to sound like I'm treating you like a museum piece. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=864.16s)]
*  I am a museum piece. Please bring it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=866.48s)]
*  We're going to try and get Anne Patchett [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=870.36s)]
*  and give her to future generations when our minds are completely fried. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=872.8s)]
*  Stuff her. Put her in the Natural History Museum. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=876.12s)]
*  Yes. What's your what's your day like? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  And obviously your husband has a smartphone, so you know what his day is like. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=882.76s)]
*  How does your day compare to other people [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=886.8s)]
*  who all of us who who have these and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  look at websites and I mean, what's it like living in your world? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=896.08s)]
*  How do you how do you get you know, how do you go traveling? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=899.36s)]
*  How do you? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=902.76s)]
*  I feel sometimes like I am the survivor of the zombie apocalypse, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=905.0s)]
*  especially when I'm in New York and I'm walking down the street [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=910.12s)]
*  and every single person is doing this. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=914.0s)]
*  When I look around at other cars [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=917.0799999999999s)]
*  and everyone is looking at their phone while they're driving their car. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=919.28s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=924.92s)]
*  But I really sounds so stupid. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=927.16s)]
*  Now, when do you look at trees? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  When do you when do you notice the natural world? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=935.52s)]
*  When do you think I want to do my best to protect the natural world? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=939.68s)]
*  Because I am a part of it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=944.12s)]
*  I am a part of the of the planet. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=945.52s)]
*  I am a part of my community. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=948.76s)]
*  No, you're not. You're just walking around looking at the palm of your hand. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  So in that sense, I think my day is really quite different. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=955.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I just spend my whole life making things harder for myself. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=960.0799999999999s)]
*  But I also write novels and and I am very interested in protecting my brain [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=964.48s)]
*  and and not just constantly being interrupted. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  I've never texted. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=973.84s)]
*  That seems like a really bad idea. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=975.4s)]
*  Texting just I don't want people to be able to get me all the time. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=977.48s)]
*  OK, here's the story. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=983.48s)]
*  It all goes back to my stepfather, my mother's second husband, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  who is the person that I grew up with, who I really loved, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=988.36s)]
*  but was a very, very weird guy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=991.96s)]
*  And he was a doctor and he gave my mother a pager, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=993.96s)]
*  the first pager ever so that when she was out. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=999.52s)]
*  And this was the 70s. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1003.52s)]
*  He would beep her and she would have to find a gas station [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1005.12s)]
*  with a payphone and call him because he wanted to know where she was. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1008.52s)]
*  OK, so that's one early childhood trauma that made me think [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't want a cell phone to we all had guns. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1015.36s)]
*  So my stepfather would say, if you're driving, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  you have to have a gun in the car because you won't be safe. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1023.36s)]
*  And so when I was in high school, I always had a gun in the car. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  Back when it was illegal to have a gun in the car. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1030.2s)]
*  16 Catholic schoolgirl uniform and a gun in the glove compartment. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1032.52s)]
*  And then people will say to me now, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1039.36s)]
*  it's not safe for you to drive without a phone. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1041.4799999999998s)]
*  It's not safe for you to be a woman out in the world without a phone. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1044.6s)]
*  And my voice thinks, or a gun. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1048.8s)]
*  I mean, either way, I have no interest in owning a gun. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  I would never own a gun. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1055.1999999999998s)]
*  But if the chips were down and I had a choice between a phone and a gun, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1057.04s)]
*  right? That's the world I came from. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1061.08s)]
*  So I don't want people to be able to find me. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't want to shoot anyone. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1067.28s)]
*  No phones, no guns. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1069.76s)]
*  Did we all seem like kind of addicts to you? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1071.12s)]
*  Yeah, actually, yes. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  And the fact that it's not discussed as an addiction is bizarre. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1078.36s)]
*  So nobody wants to get rid of the thing that they love. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1083.6399999999999s)]
*  If somebody has a profound engagement with books, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  they have no interest in banning books. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1095.16s)]
*  Right? So if you love the Internet and you love your phone, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1098.2s)]
*  you're not going to say, these things really aren't good for kids. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1102.4s)]
*  This is really addictive. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1106.64s)]
*  This is a bad idea because then it's going to come back on you. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  Bring it back to your novels. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1113.16s)]
*  Will there be a point at which you are writing novels that you think [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1114.6000000000001s)]
*  particularly if you write novels in the present about characters [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1119.8s)]
*  who have a whole today, everybody has an online life [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1124.88s)]
*  and your characters won't because you don't know that life. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1128.4s)]
*  Oh, I've read about all sorts of things. I don't know. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1131.76s)]
*  That's not limiting at all. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1134.08s)]
*  Pretty much every single thing I write is about something I don't know. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1135.84s)]
*  But phones really are the death of narrative plot, if you think about it, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1140.72s)]
*  because your character can get in touch with anyone. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  They can get the answer to anything. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1150.56s)]
*  And so what drives the narrative? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1153.08s)]
*  And it is true that I'm always working to get rid of my character's phones. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm writing a novel right now in which [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  the character is in this terrible storm and she gets sick [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1166.7199999999998s)]
*  and she doesn't charge her phone and she's quite young. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  And so she's in New York. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1172.84s)]
*  And all of these things keep happening, happening to her. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1175.12s)]
*  But she doesn't have her phone because it's dead. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  So you have to do things like that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1182.76s)]
*  You're writing technology out of your fiction. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1184.0s)]
*  As best I can. But really, that's not just me. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1187.1599999999999s)]
*  Most novelists will say it is very, very hard [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1190.76s)]
*  if the character can find anyone and connect with anyone [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1195.8799999999999s)]
*  to get the plot going. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  Do you remember dating? Do you remember dating before phones? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1202.76s)]
*  And I've only ever dated without phones, I have to say, because I'm now so old. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1206.6s)]
*  Well, I never had that. I'm older than you are, miss. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1212.08s)]
*  But you would you would make a date. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1215.8s)]
*  Yeah. And then you would go to the restaurant. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1219.12s)]
*  Maybe the person wouldn't be there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1221.28s)]
*  And then you would have to find a cell, a pay phone. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1222.84s)]
*  And then you would call them, but you would get the answering machine. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1226.44s)]
*  And then somebody would call and you'd punch a series of numbers [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1229.56s)]
*  to check your answering machine. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1232.48s)]
*  All of those things made life so much more interesting. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1235.16s)]
*  Do you feel some of the authors I have interviewed have felt a pressure [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1240.4s)]
*  to come up with books, with novels on a regular basis, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1245.56s)]
*  particularly authors who work in the sort of thriller space, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1249.96s)]
*  more popular fiction than literary fiction? Right. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1254.04s)]
*  Do you feel under pressure to keep producing novels? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1256.2s)]
*  No. On a schedule? No. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1259.92s)]
*  Again, who cares, really? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1262.96s)]
*  Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1268.56s)]
*  Everybody everybody was just fine with just that one novel. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1271.28s)]
*  You you don't need more. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1276.28s)]
*  I mean, people read them and I'm very grateful. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1278.28s)]
*  But if I never wrote another book again, the world would keep going just fine. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1281.92s)]
*  I do it because I love to do it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1287.68s)]
*  It's my privilege to do it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1289.4s)]
*  But I don't feel any pressure. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1292.2s)]
*  I never sell a book until it's finished and nobody reads it until it's finished. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1293.48s)]
*  And it's finished, finished, finished. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  When I call my editor and said, oh, I finished a book today. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1301.8s)]
*  I'm going to send it to you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1305.2s)]
*  Can you ever imagine not writing books? Yes. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1306.52s)]
*  Sure. I would miss it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1310.92s)]
*  But I think about that a lot when I'm complaining, when I'm saying, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1314.92s)]
*  it's so hard. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1320.08s)]
*  I'm so frustrated with myself. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1321.64s)]
*  I worked eight hours and I got two pages today. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1324.0s)]
*  Could I just be a little more productive? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1327.04s)]
*  And then I think or I could stop. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1329.32s)]
*  You're here because you want to be here. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1333.32s)]
*  I've got plenty of money. I've got a bookstore. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1335.32s)]
*  I've got a great life. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1337.44s)]
*  I don't need to go on and do this forever. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1339.32s)]
*  And that's that's a good reality check. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1342.52s)]
*  I do it because I want to do it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1346.16s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1348.56s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1349.72s)]
*  That was great. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1352.04s)]
*  You. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRP3X0IZNz4&t=1378.52s)]
